1,300 km of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System was shut down after an oil spill of thousands of barrels of crude oil south of Fairbanks, Alaska.
A power outage following a routine fire alarm system test resulted in relief valves opening and crude oil spilling at Pump Station 9 near Fort Greely.
Opening the valves allowed the pressure in the system to relieve and the oil to flow on a plate into a tank that holds 55,000 barrels (2.3 million gallons).
As of Wednesday afternoon, the valves were still leaking, likely due to thermal expansion inside the tank.
Another secondary containment area below the tanks capable of holding 104,500 barrels was not yet filled to full capacity.

&quot;The commissioner said: &quot;&quot;We have not yet agreed on the terms of origin and customs, but the framework we have is sufficient to start trading on July 1, 2020&quot;&quot;.
The station maintains its altitude, even with a gyroscope lost earlier during the space station mission, until the end of the spacewalk.
Chiao and Sharipov announced that they were at a safe distance from the cruise missiles.
Russian ground control activated the jet engines and the station returned to normal mode.
The trial was held in Virginia as it is the seat of the leading Internet provider AOL, the company that initiated the prosecution.
This is the first time a conviction has been handed down using legislation passed in 2003 to curb mass email, also known as spam, from unsolicited distribution to users&#39; mailboxes.
Jesus, 21, joined Manchester City last year, in January 2017, from Brazilian club Palmeiras for a fee reported to have been £27m.
Since then, the Brazilian has made 53 appearances for the club in all competitions, scoring 24 goals.
Dr. Lee also expressed concern about reports that children in Turkey have now been infected with bird flu A(H5N1) without becoming ill.
He noted that some studies indicate that the disease must decline in mortality before it can cause a pandemic.
There is concern that patients may continue to infect more people by going about their daily activities, if flu symptoms remain mild.
Leslie Aun, a spokesperson for the Komen Foundation, said the organization adopted a new rule that does not allow grants or funding to organizations that are under legal investigation.
Komen&#39;s policy disqualified Planned Parenthood because of an ongoing investigation into how Planned Parenthood uses and reports its money being conducted by Representative Cliff Stearns.
Stearns is investigating whether taxes are used to pay for abortions through Planned Parenthood in his role as chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, which is organized under the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney won the Republican Party in Florida&#39;s presidential primary with over 46 percent of the vote.
Former Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich came in second with 32 percent.
As a winner-take-all state, Florida awarded all fifty of its delegates to Romney, pushing him forward as the front-runner for the Republican Party nomination.
Organizers said around 100,000 people turned out to protest in German cities such as Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hanover.
In Berlin, police estimated there were 6,500 protesters.
Protests also took place in Paris, Sofia in Bulgaria, Vilnius in Lithuania, Valetta in Malta, Tallinn in Estonia, and Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland.
In London, around 200 people protested outside the offices of some major copyright holders.
Last month, large protests were held in Poland when the country signed ACTA, leading the Polish government to decide not to ratify the agreement for the time being.
Latvia and Slovakia have both postponed the process of joining ACTA.
Animal Liberation and the Royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals (RSPCA) are once again calling for the mandatory installation of CCTV cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses.
Chief Inspector David O&#39;Shannessy of RSPCA New South Wales told the ABC that monitoring and inspections of abattoirs should be standard across Australia.
&quot;&quot;&quot;Surveillance photos would certainly send a strong signal to those who work with animals that their welfare is a top priority.&quot;&quot;&quot;
The United States Geological Survey earthquake map did not show any earthquakes in Iceland during the previous week.
The Icelandic Meteorological Office also reported no earthquake activity in the Hekla area in the last 48 hours.
The noticeable earthquake activity that led to the phase change occurred on March 10 on the northeast side of the volcano&#39;s summit caldera.
Dark clouds, unrelated to volcanic activity, had been observed at the base of the mountain.
The clouds created the potential for confusion as to whether an actual eruption had occurred.
The Luno had 120-160 cubic meters of fuel on board when it broke up and strong winds and waves pushed it into the breakwater.
The twelve crew members were rescued by helicopter, the only injury being a broken nose.
The 100-meter-long ship was on its way to pick up its usual cargo of fertilizer, and authorities initially feared the ship might spill some of its cargo.
The proposed amendment was voted through in both houses in 2011.
A change was made this legislative session, with the second sentence first removed by the House of Representatives, then approved in similar form by the Senate on Monday.
The failure of the second sentence, which proposes a ban on same-sex civil unions, could potentially open the door to civil unions in the future.
After preparation, HJR-3 will be reviewed again by the next elected legislature, either in 2015 or 2016 to keep the process active.
Vautier&#39;s achievements beyond directing include a hunger strike in 1973 against what he believed to be political censorship.
French law changed. His activism dates back to when he was 15, when he joined the French Resistance during World War II.
He documented himself in a book in 1998.
In the 1960s he traveled back to newly independent Algeria to teach film directing.
Japanese judoka Hitoshi Saito, who won two Olympic gold medals, has died aged 54.
The cause of death was given as intrahepatic bile duct cancer.
He died in Osaka on Tuesday.
In addition to his status as an Olympic champion and world champion, at the time of his death Saito was also the chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation&#39;s training committee.
At least 100 people attended the party to celebrate the anniversary of the couple who married last year.
A formal celebration of the anniversary was planned to be held at a later date, according to authorities.
The couple had married in Texas a year earlier and came to Buffalo to celebrate with family and friends.
The 30-year-old man, who was born in Buffalo, was one of four killed in the shooting, but his wife was not injured.
Karno is a well-known but controversial English teacher at Modern Education and King&#39;s Glory who claimed to have 9,000 students at the peak of his career.
In his notes, he used words that some parents considered rude, and he reportedly used profanity during lessons.
Modern Education accused him of posting large advertisements on buses without permission as well as lying by saying he was the top English tutor.
He has also previously been accused of copyright infringement but was not prosecuted.
&quot;One former student said he &quot;used slang in class, taught dating skills through notes and was just like the students&#39; friend.&quot;&quot;
Over the past three decades, China has developed a market economy, despite still officially being a communist state.
The first economic reforms were implemented under Deng Xiaoping&#39;s leadership.
Since then, China&#39;s economy has grown 90 times.
Last year, for the first time, China exported more cars than Germany, surpassing the US as the largest market for this industry.
China&#39;s GDP could be greater than that of the US within two decades.
Hurricane Danielle, the fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, located approximately 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph.
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict Danielle will strengthen to a hurricane by Wednesday.
Because the storm is far from land, it is still difficult to assess the potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Born in the Croatian capital Zagreb, Bobek rose to fame while playing for Partizan Belgrade.
He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958.
During his time in the team, he scored 403 goals on 468 occasions.
No one has ever played more games or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
In 1995 he was voted Partizan&#39;s best player of all time.
The celebration began with a special performance by the world-famous group Cirque du Soleil.
It was followed by the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, a Janissary band, and singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.
Then the Whirling Dervishes took the stage.
Turkish diva Sezen Aksu performed with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
&quot;At the end, the dance group Fire of Anatolia from Turkey performed the performance &quot;Troja&quot;.
Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcycle racer, has died after being involved in a crash at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
During the warm-up lap, Lenz fell off his motorcycle and was subsequently hit by fellow competitor Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately treated by paramedics at the scene and transported to a local hospital, where he later died.
Zayat escaped the accident unharmed.
&quot;When it came to the global economic situation, Zapatero went on to say that &quot;&quot;the financial system is part of the economy, a crucial part.&quot;
We have a year-long financial crisis, with the last two months being the most acute, and I think the financial markets are now starting to recover.”
Last week, Naked News announced a dramatic increase in its international language news reporting mandate, with three new broadcasts.
The global organization already reports in English and Japanese, and now also launches Spanish, Italian and Korean programs for TV, web and mobile devices.
&quot;&quot;Fortunately, nothing happened to me, but I saw a macabre scene as people tried to break windows to get out.&quot;
People hit the windows with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.
&quot;One of the panes finally broke and they started coming out the window,&quot; survivor Franciszek Kowal said.
Stars emit light and heat due to the energy created when hydrogen atoms fuse to form heavier elements.
Scientists are working on building a reactor that can create energy in the same way.
However, this is a very difficult problem to solve and it will be many years before we see finished, usable fusion reactors.
The steel needle floats on top of the water due to surface tension.
Surface tension occurs when water molecules at the water surface are attracted to each other more strongly than to the molecules in the air above them.
&quot;The water molecules form an invisible &quot;skin&quot; on the surface of the water, causing things like the needle to float on top of the water.&quot;
The rail of a modern skate has a double edge with a concave recess between them. The two edges enable a better grip on the ice, even when tilted.
As the underside of the rail is slightly curved, the edge that is in contact with the ice is also curved when the rail is tilted to one side or the other.
This causes the skater to turn. If the skates tilt to the right, the skater turns to the right, if the skates tilt to the left, the skater turns to the left.
To return to their previous energy level, they must get rid of the extra energy they received from the light.
They do this by sending out a photon, which is a tiny particle of light.
&quot;Scientists call this process ``stimulated emission of radiation&#39;&#39;, because the atoms are stimulated by the bright light, causing the emission of a photon of light, and light is a type of radiation.&quot;
The next picture shows how the atoms emit photons. In reality, of course, the photons are much smaller than the ones in the picture.
Photons are even smaller than the constituent parts of an atom!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the filament eventually burns out and the bulb ceases to function.
Then the bulb needs to be replaced. It is important to be careful when changing the light bulb.
First, the switch to the light fixture must be turned off or the cord disconnected.
This is because electricity flows to the socket where the metallic part of the bulb sits and can give you a severe shock if you touch the inside of the socket or the metal base of the bulb when it is partially inserted into the socket.
The main organ of the cardiovascular system is the heart, which pumps the blood.
Blood leaves the heart in tubes called arteries and returns to the heart in tubes called veins. The narrowest tubes are called capillaries.
A ticeratops teeth would have been able to crush not only leaves but also very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that triceratops ate cycads, which is a type of plant that was common during the Cretaceous.
These plants look like a small palm with a crown of sharp, spiky leaves.
A Triceratops could have used its strong beak to pull off the leaves before eating the tree trunk.
Other scientists argue that these plants are highly poisonous and that it is unlikely that any dinosaur ate them, although today&#39;s sloths and other animals such as the parrot (a descendant of the dinosaurs) may eat poisonous leaves or fruit.
How would Io&#39;s gravity affect me? If you stood on the surface of Io, you would weigh less than you do on Earth.
A person weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io. So of course gravity pulls on you less.
The Sun doesn&#39;t have a crust like Earth that you can stand on. The entire sun is made up of gases, fire and plasma.
The gas gets thinner the farther you get from the Sun&#39;s core.
&quot;The outermost part that we see when we look at the Sun is called the photosphere, which means &#39;ball of light&#39;.&quot;
About three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to see that Venus has phases, just like the Moon.
Phases occur because only the side of Venus (or the Moon) that faces the Sun is illuminated. The phases of Venus gave support to Copernicus&#39; theory that the planets move around the sun.
A few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks saw a transit of Venus.
England experienced a long period of peace after the reconquest of the Danelaw.
In 991, however, Ethelred was met by a Viking fleet larger than any since Guthrum&#39;s a century earlier.
This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian with the ambition to reconquer his country from Danish rule.
After suffering initial setbacks, Ethelred managed to reach an agreement with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try, with mixed success, to win his kingship.
Hangul is the only intentionally invented alphabet in general daily use. The alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418–1450).
King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty and is one of the most highly regarded.
&quot;From the beginning, he gave the Hangeul alphabet the name Hunmin Jeongeum, which means ``the right sounds for the enlightenment of the people&#39;&#39;.&quot;
There are many theories about how Sanskrit came to be. One of them is about how an Aryan migration from the west into India brought the language with it.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to the Latin language spoken in Europe.
The earliest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of the Upanishads, Sanskrit gradually disappeared due to hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a complex and rich language that has given rise to many modern Indian languages, in the same way that Latin is the basis of European languages such as French and Spanish.
With the Battle of France over, Germany began preparing for the invasion of the island of Great Britain.
&quot;Germany used the code name &quot;Operation Sea Lion&quot; for the attack. Most of the British army&#39;s heavy weapons and supplies had been lost when it was evacuated from Dunkirk, so the army was quite weak.&quot;
&quot;But the Royal Navy was still far stronger than the German Navy (&quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;) and could destroy any invasion fleet sent across the English Channel.&quot;
However, few Royal Navy ships were based near likely invasion routes as the admirals feared they would be sunk by German air attacks.
&quot;Let&#39;s start with an explanation of Italy&#39;s plans. Italy was essentially the &quot;little brother&quot; of Germany and Japan.&quot;
They had a weaker army and a weaker navy, even though they had built four new ships just before the war started.
Italy was mainly looking for African countries. To conquer these, a springboard was needed for the Italian troops, so that they could sail across the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
For that they must get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. Beyond that, Italy&#39;s warships would do nothing.
Now to Japan. Japan was an island nation, just like Britain.
Submarines are vessels designed to travel underwater and remain there for an extended period of time.
Submarines were used during the First and Second World Wars. At the time, they were very slow and had a very limited range.
At the beginning of the war they mostly traveled in surface mode but as radar developed and became more accurate, submarines were forced below the surface to avoid detection.
The Germans had submarines which they were very good at piloting and handling.
Because of its success with submarines, Germany was not allowed to have many of them after the war.
&quot;Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes called &quot;King Tut&quot; or &quot;The Boy King&quot;, is one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings in modern times.&quot;
Interestingly, he was not considered very important in antiquity and was not recorded in most ancient king lists.
But the discovery of his grave in 1922 made him a celebrity. While many older tombs were looted, this tomb was left virtually untouched.
Most of the objects buried with Tutankhamun have been well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of spoked wheels made the Assyrian chariots lighter, faster and better equipped to outrun soldiers and other chariots.
Arrows from their deadly crossbow could penetrate the armor of enemy soldiers. Around 1000 BC the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
A cavalry is an army that fights on horseback. The saddle had not yet been invented, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of the horses.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Perhaps the most famous person from this culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet who wrote two of the masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems The Iliad and The Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular screenwriters and their plays are considered among the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras who is best known for his famous theorem on the relationship between the sides of right triangles.
There are different estimates of how many people speak Hindi. It is estimated to be the second and fourth most spoken languages in the world.
The number of people who have the language as their mother tongue varies depending on whether you count similar dialects.
Estimates vary between 340 million and 500 million speakers and as many as 800 million people can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu have similar vocabularies but the written language differs; in everyday conversation, speakers of both languages can usually understand each other.
Around the 15th century, Germany had a great cultural influence on northern Estonia.
Some German monks wanted to bring god closer to the natives, so they constructed the Estonian written language.
&quot;It was based on the German alphabet and a letter &quot;&quot;Õ/õ&quot;&quot; was added.&quot;
Over time, many words borrowed from German were merged. This was the beginning of the Enlightenment.
After finishing school, the heir to the throne would traditionally go straight into the military.
However, Charles went to university at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later history, gaining a 2:2 (a lower second class grade).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to graduate from university.
European Turkey (Eastern Thrace or Rumelia on the Balkan Peninsula) comprises 3% of the country.
Turkish territory is more than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) long and 800 km (500 miles) wide, roughly rectangular in shape.
The surface of Turkey, including lakes, occupies 783,562 square kilometers (300,948 sq mi), of which 755,688 square kilometers (291,773 sq mi) are counted in Southwest Asia and 23,764 square kilometers (9,174 sq mi) are counted in Europe.
Turkey&#39;s area makes it the 37th largest in the world and is as large as France (the mother country) and Great Britain combined.
Turkey is surrounded by sea on three sides: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history but its independence dates back to 1839.
Parts of present-day Belgium belonged to Luxembourg in the past but became Belgian after the Belgian Revolution in the 1830s.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country but was occupied both in World War I and World War II by Germany.
In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of the organization known today as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong is a fort ruin and a Buddhist monastery in the upper part of Paro district (in Phondey village).
It is said that in 1649 Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel created the fortress to celebrate his victory over the Tibetan-Mongol forces.
In 1951, a fire left only some of Drukgyal Dzong&#39;s remains, such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fort was preserved and protected, and remains one of Bhutan&#39;s most sensational sights.
During the 18th century, Cambodia found itself sandwiched between two powerful neighboring countries, Thailand and Vietnam.
Thailand invaded Cambodia several times during the 17th century and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Phen.
In the last years of the 18th century, the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those who have jobs work in the informal economy.
Two-thirds of Venezuelans who work do so in the service sector, almost a quarter work in industry and a fifth work in agriculture.
An important industry for Venezuelans is oil, and the country is a net exporter, although only one percent work in the oil industry.
Early in the country&#39;s independence, experts from the Singapore Botanic Gardens helped transform the island into a tropical garden city.
The orchid hybrid Vanda Miss Joaquim was named the country&#39;s national flower in 1981.
Every year around October, almost 1.5 million grass-eaters move from the northern hills to the southern plains for the sake of the rains, crossing the Mara River.
And then back to the northern part through the western, when they again cross the Mara river, after the rains that come about April.
The Serengeti region consists of Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Nature Reserve and Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania and Maasai Mara Nature Reserve in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires both conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools learned in interactive classes (storyboarding, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design requires you to rethink your image of what media production is and learn to think in new ways.
Interactive design requires that the components of a project are connected, but also comprehensible as separate units.
The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the complexity of the focal length and the number of lens elements required to achieve a focal range is much greater than for fixed focal length lenses.
This becomes less and less of a problem as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in lens production.
This has enabled zoom lenses to produce images of a quality comparable to that achieved by fixed focal length lenses.
Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the maximum aperture (and shutter speed) of the lens is usually lower.
This makes cheap zoom lenses difficult to use in low light without a flash.
One of the most common problems when converting movies to DVD format is overscanning.
Most televisions are designed to please the general public.
For that reason, everything you see on TV has cut margins, top, bottom and sides.
This is done to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. It&#39;s called overscan.
Unfortunately, the edges will probably also be cropped when you make a DVD, and subtitles at the bottom of the image may then partially disappear.
The traditional medieval castle has long tickled the imagination, evoking images of jousts, banquets and Arthurian chivalry.
Even when standing among ruins that are thousands of years old, it is easy to imagine the sounds and smells of ancient battles, you can almost hear hooves pattering on the cobblestones and smell the fear from the dungeons.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built in the first place? How were they designed and built?
Kirby Muxloe Castle is more of a fortified house than a true castle, as is typical of the period.
Its large glazed windows and thin walls would not have been able to withstand a determined attack for very long.
In the 1480s, when construction began by Lord Hastings, the country was relatively peaceful and defenses were only needed against small roving bands of robbers.
The balance of power was a system in which European nations strove to maintain the sovereignty of all European states.
The concept was that all European nations would work to prevent one nation from gaining too much power and so national governments often switched alliances to maintain the balance.
The War of the Spanish Succession was the first war whose central issue was the balance of power.
This marked an important change, as European powers would no longer have the pretext of religious wars. Thus, the Thirty Years&#39; War would be the last war designated as a religious war.
The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BCE in a fire started by Herostratos.
According to the story, his motivation was fame at any cost. The enraged Ephesians announced that Herostratus&#39; name would never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabo later noted the name, as it is called today. The temple was destroyed on the night Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander, as king, offered to pay to rebuild the temple, but his offer was rejected. Later, after Alexander had died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible while still hitting all the notes correctly. Also, try not to make too many unnecessary movements with your fingers.
In this way, you tire yourself as little as possible. Remember, there is no need to hit the keys with a lot of force for extra volume like on a piano.
With an accordion, you use the bellows with more pressure or faster speed to get more volume.
Mysticism is the pursuit of communion with, identity with, or conscious awareness of a supreme reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.
The believer seeks a direct experience, intuition or insight into divine reality/the deity or deities.
Adherents follow certain ways of life, or customs intended to promote these experiences.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship by its emphasis on the strictly personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially that of a peaceful, insightful, blissful, or even ecstatic nature.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the Punjab region during the 15th century through a sectarian split within the Hindu tradition.
Sikhs consider their faith a religion separate from Hinduism, although they recognize its Hindu roots and traditions.
&quot;Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which is Punjabi for &quot;the path of the Guru&quot;. The Guru is fundamental in all Indian religions, but for Sikhism it is so significant that it forms the core of the Sikh faith.&quot;
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469 - 1539). Then nine more gurus followed in succession.
But in June 1956, Khrushchev&#39;s promises were put to the test when uprisings in Poland, where workers were protesting food shortages and wage cuts, turned into a general protest against communism.
Although Khrushchev ultimately sent in tanks to restore order, he gave way to some financial demands and agreed to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
The Indus Civilization was a Bronze Age civilization in the northwestern Indian subcontinent that encompassed most of present-day Pakistan as well as some regions of northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
The civilization flourished in the valley of the river Indus, from which it also got its name.
Although some scholars speculate that since the civilization also existed around the now-dried Sarasvati River, the more appropriate name Indus-Sarasvati Civilization should be used, while some call it the Harappan Civilization after Harappa, the first of its sites to be excavated The 1920s.
The military nature of the Roman Empire facilitated the development of medical advances.
Physicians began to be recruited by Emperor Augustus and even formed the first Roman medical corps for use after battles.
Surgeons knew a number of sedatives, including morphine from poppy seed extract and scopolamine from boletus seeds.
They became skilled at amputation to save patients from gangrene as well as compression bandages and arterial clamps to stop blood flow.
For several centuries, the Roman Empire had great success in the medical field and created much of the knowledge we have today.
Pureland origami is origami with the restriction that only one fold can be made at a time, more complicated folds such as back folds are not allowed, and all folds have simple placements.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced divers or those with limited motor skills.
Children develop an awareness of race and racial stereotypes at a fairly early age, and these racial stereotypes influence behavior.
For example, children who identify with a racial minority where the stereotype is that they do not do well in school tend not to perform well in school once they learn the stereotype associated with their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the US and currently has 54 million user profiles.
These sites have received a lot of attention, especially in the field of education.
There are positive aspects to these sites, e.g. to be able to easily create a class page that can contain blogs, videos, photos and other features.
This page can be easily accessed by entering only a web address, making it easy to remember and easy to type for students who may have trouble using the keyboard or with spelling.
It can be adapted to be easier to read and with as much or as little color as desired.
&quot;ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) &quot;&quot;is a neurological syndrome whose classic defining triad of symptoms includes impulsivity, attention problems, and hyperactivity or excess energy&quot;&quot;.&quot;
&quot;It is not a learning disability, but a learning disorder; it &quot;&quot;affects 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps as many as 2 million American children&quot;&quot;.
Children with ADD have difficulty focusing on things like schoolwork, but they can concentrate on things they enjoy such as playing games or watching their favorite cartoons or writing sentences without punctuation.
&quot;These kids tend to get into a lot of trouble, because they &quot;&#39;engage in risky behavior, get into fights and defy authority&#39;&quot; to stimulate their brains, because their brains cannot be stimulated by normal methods.&quot;
ADD affects the relationship with other children because they cannot understand why they act the way they do, spell the way they do or that they are at a different maturity level.
When the ability to acquire knowledge and to learn changed in the aforementioned ways, the speed at which knowledge was acquired also changed.
The approach to gathering information was different. The pressure was no longer on individual recalls, but the focus shifted more to the ability to recall text.
Essentially, the Renaissance meant a significant change in the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands to get around, to carry body weight or swing through trees.
The chimpanzee&#39;s hand and foot are about the same size, reflecting the use of the hand to bear weight when the ape walks on its knuckles.
The human hand is shorter than the foot, with straighter phalanges.
Fossil hand bones two to three million years old reveal this change in hand specialization from movement to manipulation.
Some believe that experiencing many induced lucid dreams too often can be very exhausting.
The main reason behind this phenomenon is the consequence of lucid dreaming extending the time between REM states.
With fewer REM episodes per night, this state is reached where you experience actual sleep and your body rarely recovers enough to be a problem.
This is as tiring as waking up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch TV.
The effect depends on how many times your brain tries to lucid dream per night.
Right from the start, things did not go well for the Italians in North Africa. Within a week of Italy&#39;s declaration of war on 10 June 1940, the British 11th Hussars had taken control of Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured the Italian Tenth Army&#39;s chief engineer, General Lastucci.
On June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, Governor-General of Libya and the likely successor to Mussolini, was killed by a stray bullet while landing in Tobruk.
The modern sport of fencing is practiced at many different levels, from university students to professional and Olympic competition.
The sport is primarily played in a duel format, one fencer dueling with another.
Golf is a sport where players use clubs to hit balls into holes.
Eighteen holes are played during a regular round where players usually start on the first hole on the course and finish on the eighteenth.
The winner is the player who needs the least number of strokes, or swings of the club, to complete the course.
The game is played on grass and the grass around the hole is cut shorter and is called a green.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is what most people associate with travel: recreational tourism.
This is when people go to a place that is very different from their everyday life to relax and have fun.
Beaches, theme parks and campsites are among the most common places tourists visit for relaxation.
If someone visits a particular place to know its history and culture, then that kind of tourism is called cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit various attractions in a particular country or they can simply choose to focus on just one area.
The colonists who saw this activity, had also requested reinforcements.
Troops reinforcing the front lines included the 200-man 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments, commanded by Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both later generals).
Stark&#39;s men posted along the fence on the north side of the colonists&#39; position.
When the low tide opened a gap along the Mystic River along the northeastern part of the peninsula, they quickly built the fence with a short stone wall towards the northern end at the water&#39;s edge on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark placed a stick about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered that no one fire until the tribesmen had passed it.
The American plan was based on going to a coordinated attack from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder would launch a mock attack on the British garrison at Bordentown in order to block any reinforcements.
General James Ewing would take a militia of 700 across the river at Trenton Ferry, take possession of the bridge over Assunpink Creek and prevent any enemy troops from escaping.
The main assault force of 2,400 men would cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and then split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, to launch a pre-dawn attack.
With the change from quarter to half mile running, speed becomes much less important and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, a first-class runner at the distance of half an English mile, a man who can do it in under two minutes, will have to manage quite a lot of speed. But persistence must be considered at all costs.
Some cross-country running during the winter, combined with upper body strength training, is the best preparation for running season.
Correct nutritional habits alone cannot generate elite performance, but they can significantly affect the overall well-being of young athletes.
A healthy energy balance, effective hydration habits and knowledge of the various aspects of nutritional supplementation can help athletes improve their performance and gain more enjoyment from their sport.
Middle distance running is a relatively inexpensive sport, however, there are many misconceptions regarding the small amount of equipment required to participate.
Equipment can be purchased as needed, but most products have little or no impact on performance.
Even if it does not provide any actual benefits, athletes may find that they enjoy a product more.
The atom can be seen as one of the basic building blocks of all matter.
It is a very complex entity which, according to a simplified Bohr model, consists of a central nucleus surrounded by electrons, somewhat like planets orbiting the sun - see figure 1.1.
The nucleus consists of two particles - neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electrical charge while neutrons have no charge. The electrons have a negative electrical charge.
Before examining the victim, you must first check the surroundings to ensure your own safety.
You must note the victim&#39;s position as you approach him or her and any automatic red flags.
If you get hurt trying to help, you&#39;re only making things worse.
The study found that depression, fear, and catastrophizing were an indirect causal link between pain and disability in individuals suffering from low back pain.
Only the effects of black painting were addressed in the weekly meetings, not the effects of depression and fear.
Those who participated in regular activity required more support when it came to negative experience of pain, which characterized the differences between chronic pain and discomfort from normal physical movement.
Sight, or the ability to see, depends on the visual system&#39;s sense organs or eyes.
Eyes are constructed in many different ways, with varying complexity depending on what the organism requires.
The different designs have different capacities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have varying levels of sharpness. They also require different processing methods to interpret the input and different numbers to function optimally.
A population a collection of organisms within a particular species within a particular geographical area.
When all individuals in a population are identical with respect to a certain phenotypic characteristic, they are called monomorphic.
When the individuals exhibit several variants of a specific character trait, they are called polymorphic.
Colonies of migrant ants march and build nests in different phases as well.
In the nomadic phase, the wandering ants march at night and stop to camp during the day.
The colony enters a nomadic phase when available food decreases. During this phase, the colony creates temporary nests that are changed every day.
Each of these nomadic ravages or marches lasts approximately 17 days.
&quot;What is a cell? The word cell comes from the Latin word &quot;cella&quot; meaning &quot;small room&quot; and was originally coined by a microscopist observing the structure of cork.&quot;
The cell is the basic unit of all living things, and all organisms consist of one or more cells.
&quot;Cells are so fundamental and critical to the study of life that they are actually often referred to as the &#39;building blocks of life&#39;.&quot;
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses throughout the body to keep blood flowing smoothly.
These nerve impulses can be sent so quickly throughout the body, helping to keep it safe from potential threats.
Tornadoes affect a small area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy everything in their path.
Tornadoes uproot trees, tear boards from buildings, and hurl cars into the sky. The most violent two percent of tornadoes last longer than three hours.
These monster storms have winds of up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 miles/h).
People have been making and using magnifying lenses for thousands of years.
However, the first real telescopes were created in Europe at the end of the 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear both closer and larger.
Greed and selfishness will always be with us, and it is the nature of cooperation that when the majority benefits, there is always more to be gained in the short term by acting selfishly
In the long run, most people will hopefully realize that their best option is to work together with others.
Many people dream of the day when people can travel to another star and explore other worlds, some people wonder what is out there, some believe that aliens or other life may live on another planet.
&quot;But if this ever happens, it probably won&#39;t happen for a very long time. The stars are so spread out that there are trillions of kilometers between stars that are ``neighbors&#39;&#39;.&quot;
Maybe one day your grandchildren&#39;s children will look out over a foreign world and think about their ancient ancestors?
Animals consist of many cells. They eat things and digest the food inside. Most animals can move.
Only animals have a brain (but not even all animals; jellyfish, for example, have no brain).
There are animals everywhere on earth. They dig in the ground, swim in the oceans and fly in the air.
A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of any living (object) organism.
The word cell comes from the Latin cella, which means small room.
If you look at living things in a microscope, you will see that they are made of small squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, saw small squares in cork with a microscope.
They looked like rooms. He was the first human to observe dead cells
Elements and chemical compounds can shift from one state to another without changing.
Gaseous nitrogen still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is more compact but it is still the same molecules.
Water is another example. The compound water consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure regardless of whether it is a gas, liquid or solid.
Although its physical state may change, its chemical state remains the same.
Time is something that is everywhere around us, and affects everything we do, yet is difficult to understand.
Time has been studied by religious, philosophical and scientific researchers for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events that run from the future, through the present, to the past.
Time is also how we compare the duration (length) of instances.
You can measure the passage of time yourself by observing the repetition of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is something that happens regularly over and over again.
Today, computers are used to edit images and videos.
Sophisticated animations can be created on computers, and these types of animations are increasingly used in television and film.
Music is often recorded using sophisticated computers that process and mix sound.
Long into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed that New Zealand&#39;s first inhabitants were the Maori people, who hunted giant birds called moa birds.
The theory then established the idea that the Maori people migrated from Polynesia in a large fleet and took New Zealand from the Moriori where they established an agricultural society.
However, new evidence suggests that the Moriori people were a group of mainland Maoris who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, and developed their own distinctive, peaceful culture.
There was also another tribe in the Chatham Islands and these were Maoris who moved from New Zealand.
They called themselves Moriori, there were some minor skirmishes and eventually the Moriori were exterminated
People who have been involved for decades helped us appreciate our strengths and passions while openly assessing difficulties and even failures.
By listening to individuals&#39; personal stories about themselves, their family and their organization, we have gained valuable insights into local history and the people who have positively or negatively influenced the culture of the organization.
While knowledge of one&#39;s history is not the same as cultural insight, it at least gives people a sense of where they belong within the organization&#39;s history.
While the individuals and participants as a whole assess their successes and become aware of failures, they and all other participants discover the organization&#39;s values, mission and driving forces on a deeper level.
In this case, it was helpful to remember past entrepreneurship and the successes that followed, in order for people to be open to change and a new direction for the local church.
Such success stories reduced the fear of change, while at the same time it gave a positive attitude towards future changes.
Convergent thinking is problem solving techniques that bring together different ideas or areas to find a solution.
This mindset focuses on speed, logic, and accuracy, as well as identifying facts, re-applying existing techniques, and gathering information.
The most important factor in this mindset is: there is only one correct answer. You only think of two answers, namely right or wrong.
This mindset is associated with certain knowledge or standard routines.
People with this way of thinking have logical thinking, can memorize patterns, solve problems and work on scientific investigations.
Humans are superior to other species in reading the minds of others.
This means that we are capable of anticipating what other people experience, intend, believe, know or desire.
Among these abilities, understanding the intent of others is important. This allows us to resolve any ambiguities in physical actions.
For example, if you see someone smashing a car window, you probably take it for granted that they are trying to steal a car that belongs to someone else.
He would have to be judged differently if he had lost his car keys and it was his own car he was trying to break into.
MRI is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (Harvard University).
In this resonance, magnetic fields and radio waves cause atoms to emit small radio signals.
In 1970, physician and scientist Raymond Damadian discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a tool for medical diagnosis.
Four years later, a patent was granted, which was the first patent in the world to be issued in MRI.
&quot;In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the design of the first ``whole body&#39;&#39; MRI camera, which he called the ``Indomitable&#39;&#39;.&quot;
Asynchronous communication encourages time for reflection and reaction to others.
It gives students the opportunity to work at their own pace and control the pace of the instructional information.
In addition, there are fewer time restrictions regarding the possibility of flexible working hours. (Bremer, 1998)
The use of the internet and www means that students have access to information at all times.
Students can also submit questions to tutors at any time during the day and expect reasonably quick responses, rather than waiting until the next in-person meeting.
The postmodern educational approach offers freedom from absolute solutions. There is no perfect learning method.
There is actually not a good thing to learn. Learning takes place in the experience between the student and the presented knowledge.
Our current experience with all the do-it-yourself and informational, teaching-based TV programs illustrates this point.
Many people watch a TV program that informs us of a process or experience that we will never participate in or apply the acquired knowledge.
We will never research a car, build a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to investigate ancient ruins, or remodel the neighbor&#39;s house.
Thanks to underwater fiber optic cable links to Europe and broadband satellite, Greenland is well connected with 93% of the population having access to the internet.
The hotel or hosts (if you are staying in a guest house or a private home) probably have wifi or a PC connected to the internet and all settlements have an internet cafe or some place with public wifi.
&quot;As noted above, while the word &quot;Eskimo&quot; remains acceptable in the United States, it is considered derogatory by many non-American Arctic peoples, particularly in Canada.&quot;
Although you may hear the word used by native Greenlanders, foreigners should avoid using it.
Greenland&#39;s indigenous people call themselves Inuit in Canada and Kalaalleq (plural Kalaallit), Greenlanders, in Greenland.
&quot;Crime, and hostility towards foreigners in general, is practically non-existent in Greenland. Nor are there any &quot;rough neighborhoods&quot; in the cities. &quot;
Cold weather is perhaps the only real danger the unprepared face.
If you&#39;re visiting Greenland during the cold season (given that it gets colder the further north you go), it&#39;s important to bring enough warm clothing.
The very long days in summer can lead to problems getting enough sleep and associated health problems.
During the summer, also watch out for the Nordic mosquitoes. Although they do not spread any diseases, they can be annoying.
Although San Francisco&#39;s economy is linked to its status as a world-class tourist attraction, the economy is diverse.
The largest labor market sectors are professional services, government, finance, trade and tourism.
Its frequent portrayals in music, movies, literature and popular culture have helped make the city and its landmarks known worldwide.
San Francisco has developed an extensive tourism infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants, and first-class meeting facilities.
San Francisco is also one of the country&#39;s best places for other Asian cuisines: Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
A trip to Walt Disney World is an important pilgrimage for many American families.
&quot;The &quot;&quot;typical&quot;&quot; visit involves flying into Orlando International Airport, taking a bus to an on-site Disney hotel, spending about a week without leaving Disney grounds, and returning home.&quot;
&quot;There are an infinite number of variations, but this is what most people mean when they talk about ``going to Disney World&#39;&#39;.&quot;
Many tickets sold online on auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are partially used multi-day park-hopper tickets.
Although it is very common, Disney forbids it: the tickets are non-transferable.
Every campsite below the rim in the Grand Canyon requires a so-called outdoor permit.
Permits are limited to protect the canyon, and are released on the first day of the month, four months before the start month.
Thus, a wilderness permit with an optional start date during the month of May becomes available on January 1.
Space at the most popular areas, such as Bright Angel Campground next to Phantom Ranch, is usually filled by inquiries received the first day they open for reservations.
There are a limited number of permits reserved for those requesting to enter on foot, available on a first-come, first-served basis.
Getting into Southern Africa by car is a great way to see the beauty of the entire area and get to places off the beaten track.
This can be done with a normal car with careful planning but four wheel drive is highly recommended and many places can only be reached with a four wheel drive car with a high wheelbase.
Remember when planning that while South Africa is stable, not all of its neighboring countries are.
The requirements and costs for a visa vary from country to country and are affected by which country you come from.
Each country also has unique laws that specify requirements for which devices must be in the car for emergency situations.
The city of Victoria falls is located in western Zimbabwe, on the other side of the border with Livingstone, Zambia and close to Botswana.
The city is located right next to the waterfalls, and these are the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers enough options for longer stays for both adventure seekers and sightseeing.
During the rainy season (November to March), the volume of water is greater and the falls are more dramatic.
You&#39;re bound to get wet if you cross the bridge or walk along the tracks that wind near the falls.
On the other hand, it is precisely because the bodies of water are so huge that your view of the actual Niagara Falls is obscured - by all the water!
Tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). KV62 is perhaps the most famous of the tombs in the valley, the site of Howard Carter&#39;s discovery of the nearly intact royal burial of the young king in 1922.
Compared to most of the other royal tombs, Tutankhamun&#39;s tomb is hardly worth visiting, as it is much smaller and has limited decoration.
Anyone wanting to see evidence of the damage done to the mummy in attempts to move it from the coffin will be disappointed as only the head and shoulders are visible.
The extraordinary treasures in the tomb are no longer there, but have been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Visitors short on time are best off spending their time elsewhere.
Phnum Kraôm, 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. This hilltop temple was built in the late 8th century, under King Yasovarman.
The eerie atmosphere of the temple and the view of the Tonle Sap lake make the climb to the hill worthwhile.
A visit to the site can easily be combined with a boat trip on the lake.
The Angkor Pass is required to enter the temple, so don&#39;t forget to bring your pass when you get to Tonle Sap.
Jerusalem is Israel&#39;s capital and largest city, although most countries and the United Nations do not recognize Israel&#39;s capital.
The ancient city in Judea has a fascinating history that stretches back thousands of years.
The city is sacred to three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and serves as a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
Jerusalem is one of the most important tourist destinations in Israel due to the city&#39;s religious importance, and especially thanks to the many sites in the Old City.
Jerusalem has many historical, archaeological and cultural sites, along with lively and crowded shopping centers, cafes and restaurants.
Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to receive an invitation before arriving in Ecuador via international airports or border crossings.
This letter must be approved by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and meet specific requirements.
These requirements are designed to create a regulated flow of migration between the two countries.
Cuban citizens holding a US green card should apply to an Ecuadorian consulate for a waiver of this requirement.
Your passport must be valid for at least six months beyond your travel dates. A return or onward ticket is needed to prove how long you will be staying.
The tours are cheaper for larger groups, so if you are alone or just with a friend, try to meet other people and form a group of four to six for a cheaper price per person.
It&#39;s nothing to worry about though, as tourists are often moved around to fill the cars.
It actually seems more like a way to trick people into thinking they have to pay more.
Above the northern part of Machu Picchu rises this steep mountain, which is often seen in the background of many photos of the ruins.
It looks a little scary from below, and it&#39;s a steep and difficult climb, with most people in reasonably good shape should be able to do it in around 45 minutes.
Stone steps are laid along most of the path and steel cables are used as railings in the steeper sections.
So you can expect to be out of breath, and take it easy on the steeper parts, especially when it&#39;s wet, as it can quickly become dangerous.
Near the top there is a small cavity that you have to pass through, it is quite low and narrow to squeeze through.
The sites and wildlife of the Galápagos Islands are best seen by boat, just as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships sail in the Galapagos – varying in size from 8 to 100 passengers.
Most people book their places well in advance (as the boats are often full during high season).
Make sure you book through a travel agency that specializes in the Galapagos, with good knowledge of many different types of ships.
This will ensure that your particular interests and/or limitations are matched with the ship that best suits them.
Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was under Inca rule while the indigenous Araucans (Mapuche) inhabited the central and southern parts of Chile.
The Mapuche were also one of the last independent groups of Native American peoples, not fully absorbed into Spanish-speaking rule until after Chile&#39;s independence.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (in the midst of the Napoleonic Wars which left Spain without a functioning central government for a couple of years), the decisive victory over the Spanish was not achieved until 1818.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominicana) is a Caribbean country that extends to the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti.
In addition to white sand beaches and mountain scenery, the country is also home to the oldest European city in the Americas, today part of Santo Domingo.
The island was inhabited from the beginning by the Tainos and the Caribs. The Caribs were an Arawak-speaking people who arrived on the island around 10,000 BCE
Within a few years of the arrival of European explorers, the Taino population had been greatly reduced by the Spanish conquistadors.
Based on Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias), the Spanish conquistadors killed about 100,000 Taínos between 1492 and 1498.
Union Garden. This space was built as the atrium of a 17th-century monastery, of which the Templo de San Diego is the only surviving building.
It now functions as a central square and there are always things going on, day and night.
There are a number of restaurants surrounding the garden and in the afternoons and evenings free concerts are often given from the gazebo in the middle.
Callejon del Beso (Alley of the Kiss). Two balconies separated by only 69 centimeters are home to an old love legend.
Some children can tell you the story for a few pennies.
Bowen Island is a popular day trip or weekend trip that offers paddling, hiking, shops, restaurants and more.
This authentic community is located in Howe Sound just outside of Vancouver and is easily accessible via scheduled water taxis that depart from Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.
For those who like outdoor activities, hiking The sea-to-sky corridor is a must.
Whistler (1.5 hour drive from Vancouver) is expensive, but well known due to the 2010 Winter Olympics.
In the winter, enjoy some of the best skiing in North America, and in the summer, try real mountain biking.
Permits must be booked in advance. You must have a permit to stay overnight at Sirena.
Sirena is the only park ranger station that, in addition to camping, offers accommodation in a dormitory and hot meals. La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos only offer camping without dining.
It is possible to secure park permits directly from the park ranger station in Puerto Jiménez, but they do not accept credit cards
The parking service (MINAE) does not issue parking permits more than one month before expected arrival.
CafeNet El Sol offers a reservation service for a fee of 30 US dollars, or 10 dollars for a one-day pass; more information is available on their Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands is an island country freely associated with New Zealand, located in Polynesia, in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean.
It is an archipelago with 15 islands that spread over 2.2 million square kilometers of sea.
&quot;With the same time zone as Hawaii, the islands are sometimes referred to as ``Hawaii down under&#39;&#39;.&quot;
Although smaller, it reminds some older visitors of pre-statehood Hawaii without all the big tourist hotels and other developments.
The Cook Islands have no cities, but consist of 15 different islands. The largest are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
Offering luxurious bed &amp; breakfasts has today been elevated to a kind of art form in developed countries.
In the upper price range, hostels naturally compete mainly with two important things: beds and breakfast.
Consequently, at the finest of such establishments, one can probably find the most luxurious bedding, perhaps a handmade quilt or an antique bed.
The breakfast can include seasonal delicacies from the region or the host&#39;s special dish.
The place can be a historic old building with antique furniture, well-kept grounds and a swimming pool.
Getting into your own car and setting off on a long journey has an inherent allure in its simplicity.
Unlike larger vehicles, you are probably already used to driving your car and know its limitations.
Pitching a tent on private land or in cities of any size can easily attract unwanted attention.
In summary, own car is a very good way to travel around, but that in itself does not mean the same thing as camping.
Car camping is possible if you have a minivan, SUV, sedan or station wagon with fold-down seats.
Some hotels date back to the golden era of steam railways and ocean liners; before the Second World War, during the 19th century or early 20th century.
It was in these hotels that the rich and famous lived at the time, and often had great dinners and nightlife.
The old-fashioned fittings, the lack of the latest comforts, and a certain elegant old age are also part of their character.
As they are usually privately owned, they sometimes house visiting heads of state and other dignitaries.
An affluent traveler might consider a round-the-world trip with stops at many of these hotels.
A hospitality network is an organization that mediates contact between travelers and residents of the cities they will visit.
Joining such a network usually only requires filling out an online form; although some networks offer or require additional verification.
Then a list of available hosts is provided, either in print and/or online, sometimes with references and reviews from other travelers.
Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004 after programmer Casey Fenton found a cheap flight to Iceland, but had nowhere to stay.
He emailed students at the local university and received an overwhelming number of offers of free accommodation.
Hostels are mainly aimed at young people – a typical guest is in their 20s – but you can often find older travelers there too.
Families with children are an unusual sight, but in some hostels they have the option of staying in private rooms.
The city of Beijing in China will host the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics.
Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and the ice branches.
Other ski events take place in the Taizicheng Ski Area in Zhangjiakou, which is about 220 km from Beijing.
Most temples have an annual festival starting from late November to mid-May, which varies according to each temple&#39;s annual calendar.
Most of the temple festivals are celebrated as part of the temple jubilee or birthday of the present deity or some other major event associated with the temple.
Kerala&#39;s temple festivals are very interesting to watch, with regular processions of decorated elephants, temple orchestras and other festivities.
A World Exposition (also called World Exposition or just Expo) is a large international festival of art and science.
Participating countries present artistic and educational exhibitions in national pavilions to showcase issues concerning the world or their country&#39;s culture and history.
International Horticultural Shows are specialized events that showcase flowers, botanical gardens and anything else related to plants.
Although in theory they can be organized annually (as long as they are in different countries), in practice this does not happen.
These events normally last anywhere between three and six months and are held on sites at least 50 hectares in size.
There are many different film formats that have been used over the years. Standard 35mm film (36 by 24mm negative) is the most common.
It can usually be refilled fairly easily if it runs out and provides a resolution roughly equivalent to a modern system camera.
Some medium format film cameras use a 6 by 6 cm format, specifically a 56 by 56 mm negative.
This gives almost four times better resolution than a 35mm negative (3136mm2 compared to 864).
Wildlife is among the most challenging subjects for a photographer and requires a combination of luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
Wildlife photography is often taken for granted, but as with photography in general, a picture is worth a thousand words.
Photographing wildlife often requires a long telephoto lens, but things like a flock of birds or a small animal need different lenses.
Many exotic animals are difficult to find, and parks sometimes have rules around commercial photography.
Wild animals can be either shy or aggressive. The environment can be chilly, hot, or otherwise inhospitable.
Over 5,000 different languages are spoken in the world. Of these, more than twenty languages are spoken by 50 million people or more.
Written words are also often easier to understand than spoken words. This is especially true for addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce in an intelligible way.
In many entire nations you are completely fluent in English and in even more you can expect limited knowledge - especially among younger people.
Imagine a Manchester resident, a Boston resident, a Jamaican and a Sydney resident sitting at a table having dinner in a restaurant in Toronto.
They entertain each other with stories from their hometowns, told in their distinct dialects and local slang.
Buying food in supermarkets is usually the cheapest way to eat. Without cooking facilities, however, the choices are limited to ready meals.
Grocery stores are expanding their range of convenience foods more and more. Some even have a microwave or something similar so you can heat the food.
In some countries or types of stores, there is at least one restaurant on site, often a fairly informal one with affordable prices.
Make copies of your policy and your insurance company&#39;s contact information and carry them with you.
In order to receive advice/authorisations or claim, they must provide the insurance company&#39;s email address and international telephone number.
&quot;Keep an extra copy in your luggage and online (email to yourself as an attachment, or save to the &quot;&quot;cloud&quot;&quot;).&quot;
If you are traveling with a laptop or a tablet, be sure to store a copy on its memory or hard drive (accessible without internet).
Also give copies of policy documents/contact details to fellow travelers and family and friends back home who are willing to help.
Moose are not normally aggressive but defend themselves if they perceive a threat.
When people don&#39;t see moose as potentially dangerous, they can get too close and put themselves in danger.
Consume alcoholic beverages in moderation. Alcohol affects everyone differently, and it is important to know your limit.
Long-term health problems that can arise from excessive imbibing include liver disease and even blindness and death. The potential danger increases with the consumption of illegally produced alcohol.
Illegal liquor can contain various dangerous impurities such as methanol, which even in small doses can cause blindness or death.
Glasses can be cheaper abroad, especially in high-income countries where labor costs are lower.
Consider doing an eye exam at home, especially if insurance covers it, and bring the prescription to have it filed elsewhere.
Exclusive branded frames available in such areas can have two problems; some may be plagiarism and the genuine ones imported may be more expensive than at home.
Coffee is one of the world&#39;s most traded commodities and you can probably find many types in your home region.
Despite this, there are many special ways of drinking coffee around the world that are worth experiencing.
Canyoning is about being at the bottom of a canyon, which is either dry or full of water.
Canyoning combines elements from swimming, climbing and jumping - but requires relatively little training or good physical condition to get started (compared to e.g. rock climbing, diving or alpine skiing).
Hiking is an outdoor activity that involves walking in nature, often along hiking trails.
Day hiking includes distances of less than a mile up to longer distances that can be completed in one and the same day.
For a day trip along an easy trail, not much preparation is needed and any average fit person can enjoy them.
Families with young children may need more preparation, but a day outdoors is easy to do even with toddlers and preschoolers.
Internationally, there are almost 200 organizations for running tours. Most operate independently.
&quot;Global Running Tours&#39; successor, Go Running Tours, connects dozens of providers of so-called &quot;sightrunning&quot; on four continents.&quot;
&quot;With roots in Barcelona&#39;s &quot;Running Tours Barcelona&quot; and Copenhagen&#39;s &quot;Running Copenhagen&quot;, it quickly expanded with &quot;Running Tours Prague&quot; based in Prague and other cities.&quot;
There are many things that you need to think about before and during your trip.
&quot;When you travel, don&#39;t expect things to be like &#39;back home&#39;. Manners, laws, food, traffic, accommodation, norms, language and so on will differ in some way from where you live.&quot;
This is something you always need to keep in mind to avoid disappointment or perhaps even distaste for local customs.
Travel agencies have been around since the 19th century. A travel agency is usually a good choice for a trip that goes beyond a traveler&#39;s previous experience of nature, culture, language or low-income countries.
Although many agencies are willing to take on most common bookings, many agencies specialize in particular types of travel, budget ranges or destinations.
It may be better to use an agency that often books similar trips to yours.
Take a look at what trips the agent is promoting, whether on a website or in a shop window.
If you want to see the world on the cheap, either as a necessity, lifestyle or challenge, there are many ways to do it.
Basically, they can be divided into two categories: Either you work while traveling, or you try to limit your expenses. This article is focused on the latter.
&quot;For those of you who are happy to sacrifice convenience, time and predictability to reduce expenses to basically zero, see &quot;travel on a minimal budget&quot;&quot;.
The advice assumes that travelers neither steal, trespass, participate in the illegal market, beg or otherwise exploit other people for their own profit.
Border control is usually the first stop after disembarking from a plane, boat or other vehicle.
On some trains that cross borders, checks are made while the train is in motion, and you should have a valid ID document when you get on.
On night trains, passes can be collected by the conductor so you don&#39;t have to have your sleep interrupted.
Registration is another requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you must register your presence and the address where you live with the local authorities.
This may require filling in a form with the local police or visiting the immigration office.
In many countries with such a law, local hotels handle registration (be sure to ask).
In other cases, you only need to register if you rent rooms that are outside tourist accommodation. But this makes the law much more obscure, so find out how it works beforehand.
Architecture is about the design and construction of buildings. The architecture of a place is often a tourist attraction in itself.
Many buildings are quite beautiful to look at and the view from a tall building or a cleverly placed window can be a very beautiful sight.
Architecture overlaps significantly with other fields, including urban planning, road and water engineering, decorative arts, interior and landscape design.
Many villages are far away, so there is no real nightlife unless you go to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, almost all of the aforementioned casinos serve drinks and several of them also bring in famous names as entertainment (mainly big ones from the immediate vicinity of Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Beware: small-town bars here are not always good places to hang out for outside visitors.
First, northern New Mexico has significant problems with drunk driving, and the concentration of drunk drivers is high near bars in small towns.
Unwanted wall paintings or graffiti are called graffiti.
Although it is far from a modern phenomenon, most people probably associate it with youth vandalizing public and private property with spray paint.
&quot;Nowadays, however, there are established graffiti artists, graffiti establishments and &quot;legal&quot; walls. In these contexts, the graffiti paintings often resemble works of art rather than illegible tags.&quot;
Boomerang throwing is a popular skill that many tourists want to learn.
If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang that returns to your hand, make sure you have a good returning boomerang.
Most boomerangs in Australia do not actually return. As a beginner, it is best not to cast in windy conditions
Hangi-cooked food is cooked in a hot pit in the ground.
The pit is heated either with hot stones from a fire or by the geothermal heat that in some places heats the ground naturally.
Hangin is often used to cook a traditional kind of barbecue dinner.
Several places in Rotorua offer geothermal hangi, while other types of hangi can be tasted in places like Christchurch and Wellington.
MetroRail has two classes of commuter trains in and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also known as First Class) and Metro (known as Third Class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and not so crowded, but a little more expensive, but still cheaper than regular metro tickets in Europe.
Each train has both MetroPlus and Metro carriages; The MetroPlus carriages are always at the end of the train closest to Cape Town.
Carrying for others - Never leave your bags out of sight, especially when crossing international borders.
You can end up being used as a drug carrier without your knowledge, which can get you into a lot of trouble.
This includes waiting in line, as drug dogs can be used at any time without warning.
Some countries have very harsh penalties even for first-time offenders, these can include prison sentences of more than ten years or the death penalty.
Luggage left unattended is a target for thieves and can also attract the attention of authorities concerned about bomb threats.
If you are at home, the odds are very high that you are already immune to them due to constant exposure to the local bacteria.
But in other parts of the world, where the bacteriological fauna is new to you, you are much more likely to encounter problems.
In warmer climates, bacteria can both grow faster and survive longer outside the body.
Thus the torments of Delhi-belly, Pharaoh&#39;s curse, Montezuma&#39;s revenge and their many friends.
As with respiratory problems in colder climates, intestinal problems in warmer climates are quite common and in most cases noticeably annoying, but not directly dangerous.
If you&#39;re traveling in a developing country for the first time—or in a new part of the world—don&#39;t underestimate the potential culture clash.
Many seasoned travelers have been captivated by the novelty of traveling in developing countries, where many small cultural adjustments can quickly turn into an advantage.
Consider splurging on hotels, food and service with Western style and quality, especially in your first few days, to help you acclimate.
Do not sleep on a mattress or pad on the ground in areas where you are unfamiliar with the local wildlife.
If you want to camp outside, bring a tent bed or hammock to keep away from snakes, scorpions and the like.
Fill your home with tasty coffee in the morning and some calming chamomile tea in the evening.
When you&#39;re on vacation, you have time to take care of yourself and take a few extra minutes to brew something special.
If you&#39;re feeling more adventurous, you can take the opportunity to squeeze juice or mix smoothies:
maybe you&#39;ll discover a simple drink that you can make for breakfast when you&#39;re back in your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a rich drinking culture, go to bars or pubs in neighborhoods you don&#39;t visit often.
For those unfamiliar with medical jargon, the words infectious and contagious have different meanings.
An infectious disease is a disease caused by a pathogen, e.g. a virus, bacteria, fungus or other parasites.
A contagious disease is a disease that is easily transmitted by being close to an infected person.
Many governments require inbound visitors or outbound residents of their countries to be vaccinated against a range of diseases.
These requirements can often differ depending on which countries a traveler has visited or intends to visit.
One of the great things about Charlotte, North Carolina is that it has an abundance of quality options for families.
Residents who moved in from other areas often cite the area&#39;s family-friendliness as the main reason they moved there, and visitors often find the city easy to enjoy with children.
Over the past 20 years, the number of kid-friendly options in north central Charlotte has grown exponentially.
Taxis are generally not used by families in Charlotte, although they may be used in certain circumstances.
A fee applies for more than 2 passengers, so this option may be more expensive than necessary.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth and surrounds the South Pole.
Tourist visits are expensive, require physical health, can only take place in summer Nov–Feb and are mostly limited to the peninsula, islands and Ross Sea.
A few thousand employees live here in the summer on about four dozen bases, mainly in those areas; a small number stay over the winter.
The interior of Antarctica is a desolate plateau covered by 2-3 km thick ice.
Occasional specialist tours go inland by air for mountain climbing or to reach the Pole where there is a large base.
The main South Pole Traverse is a 1,600 km route from McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea to the South Pole.
It is compacted snow with cracks, filled and marked with flags. You can only travel there with special tractors, trailers with fuel and supplies.
These are not very nimble so the track has to take a long turn around the transantarctic mountains to get onto the plateau.
The most common cause of accidents in winter is slippery roads, pavements and especially steps.
At a minimum, you need shoes with suitable soles. Summer shoes rarely grip well enough on ice and snow; even some winter shoes can be deficient.
The pattern should be deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more, and the material soft enough in cold temperatures.
Some boots have studs and there are add-ons with studs in slippery conditions, suitable for most shoes and boots, for the heels or heels and soles.
Heels should be both low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) is often used to improve road grip by spreading it on roads or paths.
Avalanches are not abnormal; steep slopes can only hold a certain amount of snow and the excess will fall as avalanches.
The problem is that snow is sticky so some trigger is needed for it to come down, and snow coming down can itself become a trigger for the rest.
Sometimes the original triggering event is the sun warming the snow, sometimes more snowfall, sometimes other natural events, often a human.
A tornado is a spinning column of very low air pressure that sucks the surrounding air inward and upward.
They generate high winds (often 160-320 km/h) and can lift heavy objects into the air and move them as the tornado moves.
&quot;They start as funnels descending from storm clouds and become ``tornadoes&#39;&#39; when they come down to the ground.&quot;
A connection to a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is an excellent way to bypass both political censorship and commercial IP geofiltering.
They are superior to web proxy servers for several reasons: They redirect all internet traffic, not just http.
They usually offer a higher bandwidth and higher quality of service. They are encrypted and therefore harder to spy on.
&quot;The media companies routinely lie about the purpose of this, claiming it is to &quot;&quot;prevent piracy&quot;&quot;.&quot;
In fact, region codes have no effect whatsoever on illegal copying; a bit-by-bit copy of a disc works just fine on any device that can play the original.
The actual purpose is to give these companies more control over their markets; it&#39;s about getting the money rolling.
As the calls are connected over the internet, you do not need to use a telecommunications company where you live or where you travel.
There is also no requirement that you obtain a local number from the community where you live; you can get a satellite internet connection in the wilderness of Chicken, Alaska and dial a number that claims you&#39;re in sunny Arizona.
You can often purchase a global number separately that will allow PSTN phones to reach you. Where the number is from matters to people who call you.
Real-time text translation apps - applications that can automatically translate entire segments of text from one language to another.
Some applications in this category can even translate foreign language text on signs or other real-life objects when the user points their smartphone at those objects.
Translation engines have improved considerably, and nowadays often provide more or less correct translations (and less often nonsense), but some caution is needed, as they may still have got the text completely wrong.
One of the most prominent apps in this category is Google Translate, which allows offline translation after downloading data for the desired languages.
Using GPS navigation apps on your smartphone can be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate when abroad.
It can be cheaper than buying new maps for a GPS, or a standalone GPS unit or renting one from a car rental company.
If you do not have a data connection on your mobile, or if it is without coverage, their performance may be limited or unavailable.
Every corner store is stocked with a bewildering array of prepaid phone cards that can be used in payphones or regular phones.
While most cards can be used to call anywhere, some specialize in providing advantageous calling rates to a specific group of countries.
Access to these services is often obtained through a toll-free number that can be called from most telephones at no cost.
The rules that apply to normal photography also apply to video recording, perhaps even to an even greater degree.
If it is forbidden to just photograph something, then don&#39;t even think about filming it.
If you use a drone, check carefully in advance what is allowed to film and what permits are required.
Flying a drone near an airport or over a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it&#39;s not illegal where you live.
Nowadays, flights are only rarely booked directly through the airline without first searching and comparing prices.
Sometimes the price of the same flight can differ enormously at different booking points and it pays to compare search results and to look at the airline&#39;s website before booking.
You do not need a visa for short-term trips to certain countries as a tourist or business traveler, but if you go to study, you will probably stay in the country longer than if you are a tourist.
If you are staying in a foreign country for an extended period of time, you generally need to obtain a visa in advance.
Student visas generally have different requirements and application procedures than regular tourist or business visas.
In most countries, you will need an invitation from the institution where you want to study, and also proof that you can support yourself financially for at least the first year of your course.
Check with the institution, as well as the immigration department of the country you wish to study in for detailed requirements.
Unless you are a diplomat, working abroad usually means you have to declare income tax in the country you work in.
Income tax is structured in different ways in different countries, and tax rates and tax classes vary widely from one country to another.
In some federal countries, such as the United States and Canada, income tax is levied at both the federal and local levels, so tax rates and classes may vary from region to region.
Although entry controls are usually absent or a formality when entering your home country, customs control can be troublesome.
Make sure you know what you can and can&#39;t bring with you, and clear anything over the legal limits.
The easiest way to get started as a travel writer is to hone your talents on an established travel blogging site.
Once you have become comfortable with formatting and editing on the web, you can later create your own web page.
Volunteering while traveling is a great way to make a difference, but it&#39;s not just about giving.
Living and volunteering in a foreign country is a great way to get to know a different culture, meet new people, learn more about yourself, gain a sense of perspective and even gain new skills.
It can also be a good way to stretch a budget to allow for a longer stay somewhere as many volunteer jobs offer room and board and a few pay a small salary.
Vikings used the Russian waterways to reach the Black and Caspian seas. Parts of these trails can still be used. Investigate whether special permits are needed, which may be difficult to obtain.
The White Sea-Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean with the Baltic Sea via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and Saint Petersburg, mainly via rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega also connects with the Volga River, so it is still possible to get through Russia from the Caspian Sea.
Rest assured that once you arrive at the marina, everything will be pretty obvious. You will meet other boaters who will share their information with you.
You&#39;ll basically be putting up notices offering your help, walking around the docks, talking to people cleaning their yachts, trying to connect with sailors at the bar, etcetera.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. After a while everyone will know you and give you tips on which boat is looking for someone.
You should carefully choose your frequent flyer airline in an alliance.
While you may think it&#39;s intuitive to join the airline you fly with the most, you should be aware that benefits are often different and bonus points may be more generous with another airline in the same alliance.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have significantly expanded their routes to Africa, offering connections to many major African cities at prices that are more competitive than other European airlines.
In 2014, Turkish airlines flew to 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have additional travel time, check how your total trip price to Africa compares to a round-the-world ticket price.
Don&#39;t forget to factor in extra costs for additional visas, departure taxes, ground transportation, etc. for all those places outside of Africa.
If you want to fly around the world entirely in the southern hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is limited due to the lack of transoceanic routes.
No airline alliance serves all three Southern Hemisphere ocean crossings (and SkyTeam does not serve any of the crossings).
However, Star Alliance covers everything except the eastern South Seas from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is a LATAM Oneworld flight.
This isn&#39;t the only flight option if you want to skip the South Pacific and the west coast of South America.
In 1994, the ethnically Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan waged war against the Azeris.
With Armenian support, a new republic was created. However, no established nation recognizes it - not even Armenia.
Diplomatic arguments over the region continue to cloud relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The Canal District (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is the famous 17th-century district surrounding the Binnenstad in Amsterdam.
The entire area is a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique cultural and historical value, and its real estate values are among the highest in the country.
Cinque Terre, which means the five lands, consists of the five small coastal villages of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso and is located in the Italian region of Liguria.
They are on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Over the centuries, people have carefully built terraces in the rugged, steep landscape right up to the cliffs jutting out over the sea.
Part of its charm is the lack of visible corporate development. Paths, trains and boats connect the villages and cars cannot reach them from the outside.
The varieties of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland are slightly different from the French spoken in France, but they are similar enough to understand each other.
Especially in the numbering system in the French-speaking parts of Belgium and Switzerland, there are some small quirks that differ from the French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of some words is slightly different.
In any case, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss should have learned standard French at school, so they would understand you even if you used the standard French number system.
&quot;In many parts of the world, a wave is a friendly gesture that means ``hello&#39;&#39;.&quot;
&quot;However, in Malaysia, at least among the rural Malaysians, it means &quot;&#39;come here&#39;&quot;, similar to the index finger bent towards the body, a gesture used in some Western countries and should only be used for this purpose.&quot;
&quot;Similarly, a British traveler in Spain may mistake a wave of the palm of the hand to the waver (rather than to the waved to) as a gesture signaling ``come back&#39;&#39;.&quot;
Auxiliary languages are artificial or constructed languages created with the aim of facilitating communication between peoples who would otherwise have difficulty communicating.
They are different from lingua franca languages, which are natural or organic languages that become dominant for some reason as a means of communication between speakers of other languages.
During the midday heat, travelers may experience mirages that give the illusion of water (or other things).
These can be dangerous if the traveler tries to reach the mirage, wasting precious energy and remaining water in the process.
Even the hottest deserts can get extremely cold at night. Freezing is a serious risk if you don&#39;t have warm clothes.
Beware of the mosquitoes if you decide to hike in the rainforest during the summer.
Whether you&#39;re driving through the subtropical rainforest, a few seconds with the doors open when you get into the vehicle is enough time for mosquitoes to enter the car with you.
Bird flu, or avian flu as it is more formally known, can infect both birds and mammals.
Fewer than one thousand cases have been reported in humans, but some have been fatal.
Most have involved people working with poultry, but there is also some risk to bird watchers.
Typical of Norway are steep fjords and valleys that suddenly give way to a high, more or less level, plateau.
&quot;These plateaus are often referred to as ``wides,&#39;&#39; meaning a vast, open landscape without trees, a boundless expanse.&quot;
&quot;In Rogaland and Agder, they are often called &quot;&quot;hei&quot;&quot;, which means a treeless moorland, often covered with heather. &quot;
The glaciers are not stable, but move downward along the mountain. This causes cracks, which can be hidden by snow bridges.
The walls and roofs of ice caves can collapse and cracks can close.
At the edge of the glacier, large blocks break off, fall down and can sometimes jump or roll further from the edge.
The tourist season in the hill towns generally peaks during the Indian summer.
However, they have a different kind of beauty and charm during the winter, when many mountain stations get a lot of snow and offer activities such as skiing and snowboarding.
Only a few airlines still offer special bereavement fares, with some discount for last-minute travel to funerals.
Airlines that offer these include Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights departing from the US or Canada, and Westjet.
The trip must always be booked directly with the airline by phone.
