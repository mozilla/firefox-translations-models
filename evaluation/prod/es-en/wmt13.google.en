A Republican strategy to hinder Obama&#39;s re-election
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
Now, the Brennan Center considers this a myth and claims that voter fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die from lightning strikes.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: those new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what happens in Canada, the American states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
And along the same lines, a majority of American governments enacted, starting in 2009, new laws that made the registration or voting process difficult.
This phenomenon has spread since the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
Consequently, during 2011, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote were introduced in 41 states.
New election laws require voters to present a photo ID along with proof of US citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce the periods of early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the scrutiny and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with a criminal record.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state required voters to present photo identification.
The State of Indiana was the first to require it.
The Supreme Court of the United States in 2008 upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
Therefore, the Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to take into account that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, that is, 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo identification document issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
But often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than one hundred dollars.
Thus, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people who earn less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over 65 years of age, and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have a photo ID.
And there are still more.
In many states, students, the largest voters for Democratic candidates, cannot use a photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, those same states authorize the members of the fishing or hunting clubs that usually vote for the Republican parties to use the documents issued by said clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to file such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Hispanic vote.
It seems that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic party.
On the other hand, Republican legislators in 2011 supported certain laws that abolished the registration of voters on the day of the ballot in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a help desk for voters who wanted to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, voter registration drives helped register some 10 million citizens.
Measures taken since 2009 caused the new voter registration rate to fall in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have adopted laws in five other states that favor shortening the early voting period.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33% of voters who voted early were African-American, while the latter represented only 13% of the voters in the state.
In the case of Hispanics, exactly the same thing happened.
These do not represent more than 11% of the voters, which is equivalent to 24% of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who represent 76% of the electorate, do not represent more than 46% of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have vehemently opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
In this regard, the Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The US Attorney&#39;s Office stepped in to suspend the most controversial laws.
It was possible, in part, to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 states have enacted a law requiring photo identification.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted, since it is clear that they are intended to influence the results of 2012 in the key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that have adopted such laws account for 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these electoral system-wide legislative changes will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: those new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Screening for prostate cancer: to get tested or not to?
Indeed, the PSA test sometimes presents erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to carry out useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough reason to make men doubt, already reticent in themselves, about whether or not they should undergo screening tests.
Take the test or not?
We have asked two specialists for advice.
In the studies carried out in the United States, a high infection rate was detected among the sample groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
The study, with a 12-year follow-up, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% chances of suffering from metastasis if the detection test has not been performed.
I recommend, therefore, the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.
African-American men have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to get the patient to understand the degree of risk of his cancer. You should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that are not life-threatening in the long term, in which case active disease surveillance should be preferred.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since said cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a risk to their lives.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance for the disease and, if the disease progresses, we offer treatment.
More and more often we determine precise criteria to decide who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it&#39;s important to talk to your doctor to determine whether or not you should be tested.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool that allows evaluating the pros and cons of the PSA test.

prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the advances in research, adopting healthy lifestyle habits is still the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
&quot;If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50%,&quot; says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we assess that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancer.
It greatly harms people&#39;s health.
&quot;Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; said spokesman André Beaulieu.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
Fatness and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risks of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
&quot;Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer,&quot; they add.
feeding
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large amounts, they escalate the risk of colorectal cancer.
Deli products should also be avoided.
Preserving meat for smoking, drying or salting can cause the formation of carcinogenic substances.
&quot;They can damage the body&#39;s cells and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; they explain.
The vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, at the moment their investigations are not conclusive.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are conflicting.
While in one of them a decrease in the risks of prostate cancer was found, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of discussing each other&#39;s concerns and family history with their doctor.
&quot;Doing the screening test does not cause cancer.&quot;
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson caused quite a stir last summer, and with good reason.
It is believed, in effect, that this boson is a participant in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what&#39;s more, it is the particle whose existence was predicted by the Standard Model: our best or &quot;least bad&quot; explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But it is not entirely clear to physicists that it is a Higgs.
We know without a doubt that a new particle exists, and that it looks very much like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at a major physics conference held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data is still needed to be completely sure.
In any case, we assume that it is Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem low. We&#39;ll see what it&#39;s about.
There is, in this great world, a pervasive and inescapable law that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There&#39;s no way to break that rule, and don&#39;t try too hard, or you&#39;ll end up hurting yourself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that a law of these characteristics also exists in it: the Pauli exclusion principle, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot;; a &quot;state&quot; that consists, roughly, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we find the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
And on the other there are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to Berkeley Laboratories&#39; The Particle Adventure website, which is extraordinary, by the way, bosons are divided into two groups: mesons, which we won&#39;t talk about here, and &quot;force particles&quot;, whereby large forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, it should be emphasized here, are not the exotic bugs we might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or &quot;particle of light&quot; that acts as a &quot;messenger&quot; of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it &quot;disorders&quot; the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this &quot;disorder&quot; an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing more than a photon; that is, one of the &quot;force-carrying&quot; bosons.
more stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be &quot;disordered&quot; for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it, it is necessary to reach extremely high energies, a bit like an icy pond in which only a thick rock could slide across the surface.
This is why it takes a huge particle accelerator like the one at CERN (the Large Hadron Collider is a ring 27 km in circumference!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don&#39;t: a piece of paper, for example, will never stick to a fridge door by itself.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not.
Now, what &quot;can all this research contribute&quot;? asks Mrs. Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between the observations and the predictions of the MS.
For their part, many fervently want them to meet, since the slightest difference could open a door to a &quot;new physics&quot; that covers certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, such as that it does not propose any explanation regarding gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the Universe (another oops!).
But we have not found such differences at CERN so far.
repercussions
The repercussions of such investigations on our daily lives are hard to predict, but we don&#39;t think we&#39;re wrong in saying there won&#39;t be any.
For you to see: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers in the laboratories did not suspect at all the revolution that their work would bring about.
They glimpsed the scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as the physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, at first the laser was rather considered a &quot;laboratory apparatus&quot;.
Imagine...
And in addition, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the investigation.
For example, Willard Boyle himself made a light collector in 1969 in the course of his research in optics.
Despite not being his original intention at all, this sensor now serves as the &quot;eye&quot; for all the world&#39;s digital devices, earning him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but that you never know...
palliative care. The best way to die... | Devoir
In its Dying with Dignity Commission, Quebec recently debated the sensitive issue of end of life.
The debate should resume soon while a bill is prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to do.
Le Devoir has tried to see it up close.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in La Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year respite.
&quot;They had given me five years to live, but I&#39;ve been like this for seven now,&quot; he says, made a raisin, lying on his bed at the Victor-Gadbois de Beloeil palliative care center, which he arrived the day before.
&quot;But it&#39;s always a shock, we can&#39;t be prepared for this,&quot; he continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc on him: an enormous weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he resignedly accepts that they help him eat.
Brave, he even manages to smile, to talk to strangers who pay him attention, bring him medicine and offer him a bath.
The bravery of ordinary death.
&quot;My greatest wish is that my diarrhea be cured, it&#39;s humiliating,&quot; he confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for that evil.
&quot;In the course of our lives we learn that a man pees standing up,&quot; says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center.
Going back to your childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
&quot;That depends on the person&#39;s ability to accept that regression,&quot; he notes.
Because, in the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of that regression.
All patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois hospice suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer &quot;curative&quot; care.
The biggest fear of Ms. A., 89, is dying &quot;conscious and drowning&quot;.
But the disease has made him discover his children.
&quot;I have some good children,&quot; he adds.
&quot;I have no more wishes left in this life,&quot; she says, before agreeing to be fitted with a mask to help her breathe.
And he expects, in the next few days, one last visit from his son who lives in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, body care and help with food are offered.
This is palliative care given when nothing else can be done.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little, since we know that we will all end up dying one day.
Here, life goes on in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the center&#39;s doctors.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is offered mouth rinses with brandy or Pepsi, according to the lawsuit.
Diabetics no longer have their blood sugar controlled.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, your son finished his beer at the deceased&#39;s feet.
&quot;We help both patients and their loved ones,&quot; says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the Victor-Gadbois center the days go by without ever being the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man enjoying his last family reunion in the courtyard, nestled between his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, having tried everything to survive.
&quot;For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 with cancer,&quot; worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent center come from home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal phase of his life, be it at home, in hospital or in a center of care.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois Center and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this relative lack of health care in Quebec that makes many doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminent palliative care experts such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not competent enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
&quot;Recently,&quot; he recounts, &quot;I have seen a patient spend 14 days in the ER in great pain without doing what was necessary to relieve her.
I&#39;m afraid that patients want to die just because they don&#39;t get proper care.&quot;
And in parallel, many oncologists persist with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognoses.
Hélène Richard&#39;s hopes of survival were already low when she left a grueling chemotherapy treatment.
&quot;When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting,&quot; he says.
&quot;However, she had told me that there was nothing else to do!&quot;
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who request to die thank their caregivers for not attending to their requests once their pain has been alleviated thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful when it comes to pain management.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of home palliative care in Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can&#39;t pretend we don&#39;t understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved disease will have the possibility of having this palliative sedation.
The patients who are not relieved all say the same thing: &quot;I want to die.&quot;
But that does not necessarily mean &quot;I want euthanasia&quot;, but &quot;I want to be relieved.&quot;
This report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Health Research Institutes of Canada.
Wide-ranging real estate scandals in Quebec
Road network officials, BTP businessmen, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell, day after day, what they know about a formidable &quot;system&quot;, which includes the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, unionists and gangsters.
An &quot;industry&quot; that was too expensive for Québec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
&quot;It is curious how the system is pulverized once we have hunted down the big media,&quot; ironically Jacques Duchesneau, a representative in Quebec and former chief of the Montreal Police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, made possible by an in-depth investigation into embezzlement linked to Quebec highway contracts, which the Liberal prime minister at the time, Jean Charest, had only agreed to delay.
The &quot;Duchesneau report&quot; established a direct link between the industry, the clandestine financing of parties and corruption among officials.
&quot;Since the start of the investigation in 2010, the transport ministry alone would have saved a billion dollars in contracts,&quot; reining in some of his instincts to take a fair share.
The Charbonneau Commission &quot;has already brought down two mayors,&quot; he adds, while hoping to &quot;demonstrate the ploys behind individuals.&quot;
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also applied with its team of auditors, investigators and government analysts.
This unit works in addition to the &quot;Marteau squad&quot; cops, who, since 2009, have made Montreal&#39;s &quot;sewer cartel&quot; go easy on inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has proceeded to record serial charges of fraud and corruption against city officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec&#39;s third largest city.
He is suspected of having pocketed repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers from the Montreal road network and businessmen of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have been indicted.
The latter caused a stir by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the &quot;system&quot; for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal for three years to an intermediary linked to the mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of mayor Gérald Tremblay.
M. Zambito distributed money left and right during the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals in power.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes from companies in the construction sector totaling $736,000, all this in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other officials of the road network have admitted that they received money for inflating bills between 30% and 40% for false extras.
In addition, an organizer from the mayor&#39;s party, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget and filling his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and plunged Montreal into a massive crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected Montreal politicians to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, since 2010 she has opposed the sale of municipal land purchased for $5 million and resold for $1.6 million to developers in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% of the money from electoral campaigns was dirty money
Of the investigation that will finally be carried out, she assures that she is pulling &quot;a thread to be able to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits.&quot;
And he adds that the process is &quot;painful, but positive.&quot;
We are cleaning the wounds but it would take a clean investigation unit in Montreal and being very vigilant so that dubious practices are not repeated.
How to do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that &quot;officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; but is particularly concerned about the role of &quot;&quot;elected politicians aware of the scheme.&quot;
Estimating at 70% the proportion of dirty money that went to financing electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironically: &quot;I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality.&quot;
The Quebecois government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not change the donation, according to him, &quot;as long as electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics.&quot;
He advocates a complete review of the system for awarding public contracts and party financing: &quot;we cannot sink any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with more solid foundations, with more controls and laws&quot;.
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
&quot;PSG is not FC Barcelona!&quot;
This season he has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain this progress?
It could be explained by individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I advance from day to day by his side.
The technical staff has also contributed a lot to me.
And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a match, that&#39;s easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I don&#39;t get hot.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training center to my stint in Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed by leaps and bounds.
You will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
Those recruited this summer are used to playing very high-level matches.
They know that every workout is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my positioning.
He is backed by associates like Claude Makelele, who was playing in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man the team needed?
Of course.
Ancelotti commands respect from all coaches.
Today, there is no one like him in Liga 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has a wealth of experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think he will take other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I had just come off a series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken the leadership position from us.
But we&#39;re still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the round of 16 in style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say against many very good European teams.
We want, to begin with, to finish first in our league against Porto to be able to receive the return of the round of 16.
Can PSG become a great European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a big European club, Paris has to win titles and be there for the long haul.
Today, that is not the case.
On an economic level, PSG is committed to its means to make this project come true.
Would not winning the cup in League 1, as in the last season, constitute a great failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts in taking that title of champions.
In the last season we didn&#39;t get far.
In May we were disappointed, since we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it will be the good one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media expect more from PSG?
It is normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have totally accepted it.
After we beat Troyes 4-0 at home, that they still have things to blame us for is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to start a game project.
A team is built over time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City who, after two seasons, have failed to qualify for the round of 16, and they too have invested a lot!
In view of the amounts invested, we would imagine you with a 15-point advantage for the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not doing well last season, have been &quot;boosted&quot; by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
PSG seems totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Better that we say that we have a &quot;Zlatandependencia&quot;.
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that he scores a lot of goals.
He has come to show that he is the star of League 1.
And he has shown in all the teams he has played that he is a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
It has been a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocup.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accruing playing time.
I saw things there and I came out stronger.
Today I manage to play good games in the national team.
It is what I expected since my baptism with the &quot;bleus&quot;.
We learned the lesson from what happened in the Ukraine and that is why we behave exemplary today.
What vision do you have of Didier Deschamps&#39; first month at the helm of the &quot;bleus&quot;?
You are getting results.
They are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires them to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don&#39;t want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying us for the Eurocup.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the team to Brazil.
Did the draw (1-1) on October 16 in Spain serve to lay the foundations?
That game gave us confidence.
Each one fought for all.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not experienced a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between parties.
Furthermore, as is often the case in technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a BitTorrent-style secure exchange protocol, which allows peer-to-peer file sharing.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been registered thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The bitcoin price, after having reached the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, before returning today to around ten dollars (prices are registered on the bitcoincharts page .com).
Not impressive at all when compared to world changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as &quot;the most successful virtual currency&quot;, &quot;competing with the dollar or the euro&quot; and &quot;similar to conventional currencies&quot;.
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as &quot;credits&quot;, used to progress in a video game and which can be earned by playing or bought (and sometimes even redeemed).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and deals with the changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously bookkeepers, verifiers, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually made between two electronic addresses in the form of an email.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is electronically signed through a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin changes are recorded in the public ledger, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction to that ledger.
This involves solving a mathematical challenge thrown at the computers and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a phase of file slicing, that is, transformation of a large file into a shorter and more unique digital footprint.
The computers &quot;catch&quot; the new transaction and add a number before &quot;slicing&quot; the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular fingerprint (plus leading zeros).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept one of the two transactions as valid; the other would be orphaned, since both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites offering services for Bitcoin have been hacked and escrowed bitcoins have been stolen.
&quot;The bug used does not affect the protocol itself,&quot; says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash presents the same defect.
Major players like Wikipedia reject payments of this type.
Others, like the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoin does not circulate.
In November the &quot;giant sales&quot; were launched.
&quot;$30,000 was exchanged,&quot; exults Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which turns bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of an educational book on that currency, believes a lot in the potential of this technology as well as in the transaction network.
Their system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper that way.
The bearer also manages his identity and can, therefore, remain anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in stores, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for them to provide an address that a phone can &quot;photograph and recognize,&quot; says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement away from hierarchical systems to more horizontal systems.
“It will take a while for Bitcoin to catch on, but in 2013 there could be a turnaround,” he predicts.
On the other hand, in its report the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, today considered high, in the event that this currency is successful.
We have left Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to retake possession of its territory and for Afghans to choose their future, expecting nothing from us.
We have punished above all the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 murdered soldiers, plus the wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former chiefs who have taken refuge in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks join their causes.
Tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was done by order.
The truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul unattacked, watched by helicopters.
There will be no influx of Taliban into Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country engulfed in fire and blood due to fighting between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
The Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of their peasants, overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share a desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, grabbing government land to resell as lots for refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan, while profiting from huge US subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
The people, I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.
They have experienced the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With around 65% of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of both girls and boys.
It will be necessary to give work to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is hungry for mobile phones. Television and its Turkish soap operas presenting a modern world have huge fans all over the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already worrying about reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, of strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, your country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier.
No industry has reestablished its services, no dams have been fixed or important irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral wealth.
And that only added to the feeling that the Westerners were there to get hold of them.
Without power to extract the iron ore ores from the ground and without means of transportation to transport them over the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have all but abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mines, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the massive Buddha site and remain there as the province&#39;s largest employers.
It will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country on which imports and exports largely depend, to restore their normal relations.
French troops departed on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls&#39; schools, boys&#39; schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to &quot;win hearts and minds&quot; and to accomplish the impossible task of matching aid and offensive actions, a &quot;civilian and military actions&quot; service of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), Suppressed in 2012, it brought and had brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain towns.
These jobs, greedy for local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection, and an increase in cultivated areas.
What will we leave as a souvenir after two million euros of military expenses?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often located at more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for them to be freed from the insurrection carried out by the foreign groups, something that the farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small civil aid, well controlled and coming directly to them.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
It is a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi.
As Egypt is more divided than ever over the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, he has decided to go all-out.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work.
And for almost two years Egypt has been using a provisional text, modified several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal entanglements.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his &quot;autocratic delusion&quot; and continues to &quot;betray his word&quot; and &quot;trampling on the law.&quot;
On the part of his supporters, it is assured that it is a measure to end the institutional and political crisis more quickly and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be organized in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to recover popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy wreaks havoc throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in his favour, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this resource has been voted on very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: &quot;either vote for my text or I maintain full powers&quot;, powers that will supposedly come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, the vast majority of which are Islamist, voted for the text yesterday.
The majority of the liberals did not attend the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt that they could not assert their points of view.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, substitute members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As expected, the articles voted for were unanimously.
On the other hand, the commentators are amused by the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day was expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the clock of the Constituent was wrong.
The text, which yesterday afternoon was still being voted on, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, the object of all eyes, remains ultimately identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that &quot;the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of law.&quot;
The Salafi parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, hoped that &quot;the principles&quot; could be replaced by &quot;the rules&quot;, which would have allowed for stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and their respect towards the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals dismiss it as hypocrisy and consider it nothing more than a publicity stunt.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm its compliance with Sharia laws.
According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because &quot;the people called to speak are not elected and do not have any democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy.&quot;
The fears of the liberals are also increased by the fact that the next rector of said university would be much less moderate than the current one.
&quot;For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of civil status.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not ulema but university students, some of them trained in the French system,&quot; explains Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, since the terms used imitate religious vocabulary.
&quot;We are referring specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that could be asked in the future would be to what extent are the civil judges competent to rule above all this.&quot;
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received much criticism that refers to the extended powers that it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few in number compared to what they were under the previous regime.
Another sticking point: the powers conferred on the army.
As the military wishes, the defense budget review will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defense council.
Nor will prosecutions of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as requested by associations for the defense of human rights.
They also expressed their concerns regarding the text, which they consider to be a liberticide.
The crime of blasphemy remains and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
Also, no article emphasizes the protection of women, notes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was supposed to appear on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this noon.
Supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
&quot;AIF&quot; identified the five most important reasons why one should visit Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this &quot;baptismal font&quot; will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of Jesus&#39; miracles: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, the calming of the storm and the nets full.
In this very place, Jesus appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But the largest number of holy places is in Jerusalem.
Believers walk here the Via Crucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin &quot;Via Dolorosa&quot;).
It begins at Antony&#39;s Fortress, the Praetorium, where the trial was held, and continues through the streets of the Old City, going to the Holy Sepulcher on Mount Golgotha, the site of the crucifixion, to the Stone of Anointing, and to the place burial of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian Navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the Holy Cross Monastery in Jerusalem, built on the site where, according to Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the holiest place for Jews, the Wailing Wall; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave notes here with their wishes, which will later come true.
Take a vertical trip
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great ordered to be built in the year 25 BC. C. for his family.
They are found on the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, only those who are dedicated to climbing can.
Others can reach this historic summit by funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermon ski resort, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
Until there, from the foot of the hill, bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
In this country there are about 300 museums.
In a single trip you will not be able to visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It contains the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and around 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings he has canvases by impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bath-museum, which are some rooms of old Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers from that time.
In Caesarea it is worth stopping by the exclusive Ralli private museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dali.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children&#39;s Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives are heard.
Ukraine is mentioned as well.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, since the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees, and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and they bathe there all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily sustains even non-swimmers.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to undergo treatment courses with salt water, brine and curative muds and fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to straighten their broken nerves.
Touching the mysteries of old
They are preserved by the old part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous maritime route that linked Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia passed through it.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this very place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets named after the zodiac signs.
They say that if you touch the walls in the street of your &quot;same&quot; symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples coming from all over Israel, and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk around the Roman theater, &quot;take&quot; the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don&#39;t worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speak Russian.
It is not advisable to take money for this trip in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily exchanged for shekels (currently $1-3.8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which has six stations and connects the Lower City with the Upper City.
It&#39;s actually from an underground funicular.
Traveling by any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transferring for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday night until Saturday sunset, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts its work.
But on Sunday morning a new work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, shellfish, fish without scales and dishes that combine milk and meat.
There, a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb is offered, soups and desserts made with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, falafel, which are ground chickpea balls, fruits and vegetables.
You don&#39;t see stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
Instead, there are many well-fed cats who &quot;walk around&quot; in an imposing way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Purrs love crowded places and do not refuse treats.
Car rental, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance, which is $15 a day.
And renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to tour the country and rest were citizens of the US, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the UK and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount that exceeds the same rate in 2010 by 51%, before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011 .
&quot;The great and powerful&quot; will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
While legislators and human rights defenders discuss the consequences that the law on the compulsory examination would bring, scammers who trade in &quot;false&quot; certificates have already appeared in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
They are mostly citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.
From December 1, a law comes into force, according to which every labor immigrant must take an exam to check their knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule is applicable only to those who intend to work in the service delivery sector, community service institutions, domestic services, and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, the exams will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be enough to take the language exam, but also the Russian history and the fundamentals of legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
Citizens of countries where Russian is the official language are an exception.
Persons who managed to obtain their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law.
Utility, fatality and defense of rights
The network of examination centers will function under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the Friendship of Peoples University, Moscow State University, Saint Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take the tests in all cities, right now in Russia more than 160 centers of this type are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the exam was supported by deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights advocates, long before the law went into effect, managed many times to ask the press this question: And what will this actually do?
What changes will the compulsory knowledge of the language bring, both for Russians and for the immigrants themselves?
First of all, the representatives of the Immigration Service answer, this will reduce the number of people suffering from &quot;labour slavery&quot;.
Today many people talk about defending the rights of labor immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the Russian Federal Immigration Service office in Tajikistan.
The defense of your rights must begin before your departure.
Only an organized selection system will allow solving the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are for immigrants without a profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass the medical check-up.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be doomed to encounter unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, take him on a &quot;paid little trip&quot; to a creepy, cramped shack, where he and dozens of others like he is consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive countless complaints from our immigrants.
&quot;In their homeland they are promised one thing, but upon arrival they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages,&quot; confirms the Head of the Labor Immigration Directorate of the Tajikistan Immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don&#39;t be angry, boss!
However, in the meantime, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia admit that not only do they not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also have difficulty writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as their own misfortune - few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive a normal primary education.
This is because their families don&#39;t even have anything to feed their children, let alone dress them, wear shoes, and buy what they need for school.
Upon reaching adolescence, these boys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It&#39;s difficult, if you don&#39;t know the language, they admit.
&quot;You feel humiliated and inferior.&quot;
However, when it comes to the language law, rights defenders make an important point.
The exams will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no exam and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
&quot;Welcome or no entry to strangers&quot;
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in the bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money - from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a fake registration can be done quickly and for only one and a half thousand rubles.
Employees of the Russian police know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and extortion cases appear.
&quot;They ask us one hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea,&quot; Tajikistan citizen Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
&quot;Come on, don&#39;t be stingy, buy a painting&quot;
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it became clear that not only immigrant registration documents can be false.
Several &quot;false&quot; certificates of knowledge of the language have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The forged documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they got into the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to make it easier for himself to pass the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that &quot;diplomas&quot; cannot be bought, government officials and rights advocates converge.
Until now, the authorities can promise immigrant workers who could not have successfully passed the exam the first time more time to study the basic language course.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly in relation to the owners of weapons for civilian use.
This is the government&#39;s reaction to the recent incidents: Squeeze shooting during wedding celebrations in which luckily there were no victims, and the massacre started by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, in which Squeeze seven people lost their lives.
The police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons, from 18 years to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the reforms in the law on possession of weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the &quot;strong hand policy&quot;.
An open letter has appeared online, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of &quot;senseless rigor&quot; be desisted.
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lesnikov told the BBC Russian news service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, during six months of 2012, 142 crimes were committed with the use of firearms registered in organs of the Interior, compared to a total of 1,168 crimes registered for this same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that stricter legislation in the field of weapons for civilian use will not be an obstacle for the criminal to go to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, in the Ministry of the Interior it is affirmed that the situation of the proliferation of illegal arms is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officials
The black market for arms is supplied through various channels.
The main channels are years old, says retired colonel Víctor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and in the High General Staff.
Screenshot of the website that accepts gun orders
The first, &quot;remnant of the army or military&quot;, that is, the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
&quot;The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves,&quot; says Baranets.
The next type of &quot;black weapon&quot;, those stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons stolen from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons go on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
&quot;There are proven versions that some fires were premeditated to cover up the fault,&quot; says an ex-military officer.
According to Baranets, arms manufacturers also do their bit.
&quot;Now private arms factories have proliferated that are not competitive on the international market and distribute weapons under the hood to the black market, including the one in Moscow,&quot; says the expert.
One more source of the black market is contraband.
A large number of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
&quot;There they have their own production, sometimes handmade, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of weapons,&quot; explains the former soldier.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this subject was produced in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and publicly accessible data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to the researchers, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the weapons on the black market have found their way there &quot;through the fault of officials whose work is related to weapons,&quot; the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5% correspond to &quot;illegal archaeology&quot;.
The clerk of one of the gun shops, who asked that his last name not be used, says that weapons found by illegal diggers have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers turn to military warehouses when they need a batch.
Through some ensign, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT pistol.
They remove it from the registry and pass it over the fence.
&quot;He takes the weapon to the city and sells it for 900 euros per unit with two chargers,&quot; he tells us.
&quot;But, of course, the police are aware of all the issues, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan has to be fulfilled, they make test purchases from illegal arms dealers,&quot; adds the clerk.
&quot;Like in a luxury boutique&quot;
The seller and the buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
&quot;I visited websites and blogs until a guy suggested that I go to the &quot;Begovaya&quot; platform, where there would be a man who would take me to a &quot;little corner&quot; where we could negotiate.
I only found out about the price of the weapon there.&quot;
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
&quot;To get a gun I need a friend who has connections,&quot; says the store clerk. &quot;I have a friend like that, but I don&#39;t trust him very much.&quot;
There are vendors in the markets, but you also have to come there, let&#39;s say &quot;from Mr. Ivanovih, who asked me to tell him that his daughter had lost a tooth.&quot;
I can even get a pair of steel knuckles from a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I&#39;m not going to rat him out.
Newbies search for weapons in different ways.
Former military Viktor Baranets tested himself as an illegal arms buyer in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The schemes, according to his words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there was no &quot;everything&quot;.
&quot;I felt like I was in a luxury boutique,&quot; recalls the soldier.
To the buyer, according to the words of Baranets, they do not offer a pig in a poke: everything that is there can be tried.
I, as a potential customer, don&#39;t just buy; We go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
&quot;They give me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure that the weapon shoots well, we begin to negotiate,&quot; the expert describes the procedure.
sofa shop
Web search engines lead to &quot;Vkontakte&quot; sites and groups, where it is offered to buy weapons &quot;for different purposes.&quot;
No documents or personal meetings are required for this.
&quot;It is enough to have a certain amount of money,&quot; they write in the headline of the advertisement &quot;Buy a pistol or a machine gun.&quot;
There users place their orders and ask questions.
And do they sell to minors?
&quot;Without permission, of course,&quot; asks user &quot;Ivan&quot; (spelling preserved).
&quot;I buy TT pistol. Moscow,&quot; laconically formulates his question &quot;Fedorenkov&quot;.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and catches two-handed those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then - to mine coal in Siberia
military commentator and ex-military Viktor Baranets
I have heard of such systems - usually the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People place orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
&quot;In response, they send him a photo and instructions so that he knows where the weapon is hidden,&quot; says the press secretary of the NGO &quot;The right to arms&quot;, Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if you order online, you lose your weapon and go to jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and catches two-handed those who want to buy firearms.
&quot;And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to mine coal in Siberia,&quot; he says.
Makarov for 100 dollars
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO &quot;The right to arms&quot;, a Makarov pistol can be had for 100-300 dollars.
You will have to wait a month and a half.
It is sent from military warehouses by mid-rank bosses.
According to the official statistics of the ministry, in comparison with the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, constituting 22,900, and the number of identified cases of robbery and extortion of arms, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the US go on strike.
Up to a quarter of American teens find their first jobs as cashiers at &quot;McDonald&#39;s.&quot;
In recent days, a wave of protests has begun in the United States against the low wages paid in the supermarkets of the Walmart corporation and in restaurants of the popular fast food chains, such as &quot;McDonald&#39;s&quot;, &quot;Burger King &quot;, &quot;Taco Bell&quot;, &quot;Wendy&#39;s&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Fried Chicken&quot;.
For now, no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach nine points, or if it is destined to lose strength and tame in its early stages.
The protest actions have the support of the unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to raising the modest wages earned by workers at Walmart and those in the fast food system, the protest organizers are aiming to create workers&#39; unions at these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has been virtually unoccupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called &quot;Black Friday.&quot; That day, the United States began the orgy of sales that captured millions of inhabitants, and that was sometimes accompanied by confrontations.
That day, some workers of the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and formed protest pickets along with unions and left-wing activists at the corporation&#39;s stores, whose products They target people of modest and moderate income.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles, and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs, and milk.
The products in its stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the largest supermarkets.
That&#39;s why many low-paid Walmart workers shop only at work.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
In the words of two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, in part because it pays its workers little.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or handheld scanners.
That &quot;Black Friday&quot; the marchers demanded wage increases and complained that the cost of corporate-provided health insurance went from $30 to $100 a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who is paid $9.5 an hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the median wage to $12 an hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1% more than what you spend on salaries now.
If Walmart places the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In a year they will spend a ridiculous $12.39 more than they do now.
Walmart supporters are pleased that the protest took place in only nine states and caused the corporation no loss.
&quot;Black Friday&quot; lasted in its stores from 8 p.m. Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers carried out nearly 100 million &quot;Black Friday&quot; transactions.
Company representative Dan Fogelman said in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post that &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart employees left their jobs and that the protest had been nothing more than &quot;another public relations stunt &quot;, organized by the union of workers.
&quot;Free Box!&quot;
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the targets were not exactly the Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and for that reason there are none for now), but the &quot;McDonald&#39;s&quot; and other restaurants cheap.
McDonald&#39;s says they sell billions of slices, and then they don&#39;t even give you sick leave and they don&#39;t pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, under New York and federal law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants increase it over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers in New York receive $8.90 per hour.
Nobody earns less than them in this city.
How it is possible to survive in New York with that money is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers would stop by McDonald&#39;s and work there, behind the counters, part-time after school, even though they still lived with their parents.
Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for long.
Now, I constantly stumble across some interviews with McDonald&#39;s workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a Wall Street Journal forum there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if you don&#39;t know what to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. Thursday at the McDonald&#39;s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that fast-food cashiers and cooks start being paid at least $15 per hour, that is, that their current minimum wage be doubled.
They also demanded that workers&#39; unions be created in the fast food sector.
US law prohibits the administration from denying them this right and from punishing labor activists with chicanery and dismissal.
On the other hand, management rarely makes their lives easier.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to encompass the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is excessive staff turnover.
discordant
Loud protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action came midway through the rally at the McDonald&#39;s near Times Square, which was attended by a number of local Democratic politicians, notably City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, &quot;McDonald&#39;s says it&#39;s selling billions of slices, and then he doesn&#39;t even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work.&quot;
The protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, including mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said &quot;we must support fast food workers to achieve fair wages and economic prosperity.&quot; that every New Yorker deserves.
As the New York Times described it, this was the largest such demonstration in American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even not all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people from New York work.
Whether this will spark a mass movement is not yet clear.
&quot;For now, fooling the brain is not so easy&quot;
The theme of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, lately is normally perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual conference, Google demonstrated a model in motion and later, in November, it was learned that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at Microsoft&#39;s Cambridge laboratory, Izadi Sharamom, it became clear that for the company&#39;s scientists, the glasses already belonged to a bygone era.
They are drawn to the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of your research group?
- We are dedicated to human-computer interaction, but we also try to push the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the stage of working with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with a finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold?
- Although Kinect has brought interaction to the physical level, much of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design ones.
The world of computing must be freed to ours, to the physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, to hell with those silly virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don&#39;t you think they overestimate it?
- Of course, it cannot be considered a panacea, the privacy issue remains to be resolved, since we do not always want others to find out about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter ones.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the device&#39;s camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How is that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can of soda?
You will talk and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that&#39;s going to be very hard to recognize.
- In other words, do you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we are going to have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, since they provide a good depth resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Are they lacking resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives algorithm designers more work.
In other words, we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also in Z.
Speed, the number of frames per second, is also important.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps is really lacking, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche from our lab in Redmond made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delay from 1 to 100 ms and it should be noted that modern mass produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands to what extent this affects man-machine interaction.
An equivalent of such a device would be very useful for my work, but one that does not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
- And is it not necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three &quot;cameras&quot;, one of which is actually the emitter of infrared rays and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is really just a visible fingerboard sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required number of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue of the Kinect, play around with the curvature of camera placement and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Don&#39;t you think that from the point of view of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding a smartphone up in your hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a &quot;transmutable&quot; augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could spend from glasses to smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, that is their strength (only you can see private things), but also their weakness: a glasses-based augmented reality will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let&#39;s imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the movie &quot;Iron Man&quot;, but also to any mere mortal.
There&#39;s a problem with this idea that critics often point out: there&#39;s no tactile feedback!
Hands feel nothing!
What responses is your group preparing for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh irruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
It registers touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly geared towards bringing tangibility to these &quot;images in the air&quot;. For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a sensation similar to what one feels if someone were blowing on the fingertips, but that sensation is still very weak.
There are also bracelets for the wrist that influence the nerve endings in the fingers, this too a promising direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think that he feels what he seems to feel the moment he sees something?
- That&#39;s a good idea, we haven&#39;t tried it yet.
Here lies another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that they are going to an open space, almost without end. We are also working on the idea of treadmills (not like the ones in gyms), mobile platforms, as well as giant balloons.
For now, fooling the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That&#39;s what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, that many things are in a state of complete conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
&quot;Rosbalt&quot; continues the &quot;Vanguardism of St. Petersburg&quot; project, dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, at the forefront of art and culture.
On this list of the best are brilliant figures of the St. Petersburg art and scene, whose achievements reach beyond the city: often finding recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing about them.
The new hero of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and openings.
Kirill Miller&#39;s paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophical short-story writers from Saint Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city arouses smiles in the inhabitants and lifts everyone&#39;s mood.
Recently, he took up a barrel organ and became the organ-grinder of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to play such a difficult role, due to his bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why do you go around the city dressed in red, and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the color red because I am a fashion designer and I am dedicated to appearance and image.
In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, image makers and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little gray arouses aggression and agitation of not good properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions are an invitation to debate.
- When did you understand that you should be an artist?
- At an exhibition of the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that this was my path.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new ones, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I made friends with new wave artists, with the ones after the ones that were exhibited in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to &quot;Pushkinskaya-10&quot;, and the new wave is over.
I plunged into the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
- And all this came together in your Art Clinic... - It was important for me to be in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds should gather.
In 1995, I occupied a territory on Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of St. Petersburg bohemia.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way in which Schnur brought &quot;Van Gogh&#39;s Ear&quot; to the project.
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonograms, wore tight pants, among them was the currently fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group began to play live, it became &quot;Leningrad&quot;.
Trachtenberg was a host on many shows before Hali-galivskih&#39;s time.
We gave them Trachtenberg and it was the start of his great career; basic education and training received from us.
Gallery &quot;D 137&quot;, the &quot;Griboyedov Club&quot;, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and regular customers.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the survey was done in the press, the prize was &quot;The people of our city&quot;.
In the nomination &quot;Artist of the Year&quot; I was chosen, thus ended my culmination.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and the culture of the last century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separate. One can be popular but very uneducated.
- There is something recognizable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in them the present and the occurrence are clearly expressed.
I&#39;m going to do a scheduled exhibition, &quot;The Russian Museum in clowns.&quot;
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being like that is painful and scary.
But in clowns everything is smeared and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and compulsory change of clothes.
Now they follow one by clothes, orienting themselves externally, but not inside the person.
And, perhaps that person should not even shake hands, but rather spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed when you change your clothes.
- We recently saw you in the role of urban organ grinder. - A cultured city must have such a hero.
Who better than me to be!
- Good, but maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, tactful.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before, people gathered in herds, the bohemians wanted one thing, the simpletons another.
Now everyone has split into micro-communities, it&#39;s hard to please everyone.
I&#39;m not a hundred dollar bill to be liked by everyone.
Now you have to think who you want to like.
Now every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov they come in thousands!
- The abandoned ones go to see it, the sexual-social sphere works there.
And 300 people go to a cultural event, 10 thousand will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything withers.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to cheat them, not to spoil what you have achieved.
When he was young he made such pictures that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which usually people end up with.
Now they often confuse the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of yesterday&#39;s culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, they refused money just to paint pictures.
I am in favor of this culture.
- Kirill, what is missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: official of culture.
But not all of them can dedicate themselves to culture.
When the kings were correct everything was different, the kings perhaps did not understand the culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the correct experts.
In Moscow now there are very good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could well be experts, but they are closed, because experts at a higher level are needed to properly assess them and lead the way.
Now subjective personal taste is thriving.
The same for Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land there.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural terrain and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of curious people who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be executed with a grant from Saint Petersburg.
Give birth in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a killer asteroid crash.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board leave in search of a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is asked: how to continue the species in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think there is little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
&quot;These are Venus and Mars,&quot; says the chief researcher of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg PK (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Problems of reproduction in space with flora began to be addressed.
It has been half a century since experiments with plants were carried out.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, drosophila.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent into space to see how the embryo develops under weightlessness.
As a result, we obtain a normal chick.
But then the problems start.
&quot;The problem is that this chick has to find support, it has to stand on its own two feet and start moving,&quot; explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory at the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Finding no support, the chicks somersaulted randomly.
And after 10 hours in newborns there was a complete atrophy of the instincts.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they simply died.
&quot;And twice we managed to hatch the chicks, but then we stopped because it was impossible to work there with them,&quot; Vladimir Sychev comments on the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last time a biological &quot;miniarch&quot; flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 the experiments will continue.
However, only species of the same sex will travel on the &quot;Bion&quot; biosatellite.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
&quot;This was precisely on biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this need to be carried out,&quot; comments Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been successfully addressed.
It is a difficult challenge.
Animals, having lost their usual habitat, are simply unable to realize their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is capable of creating an appropriate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling into space for 50 years.
The greatest risk was passed by Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight into space.
She may or may not have a baby after this flight.
&quot;After all, no one has answered this question,&quot; says aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just a year after flying into space, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl&#39;s father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was in orbit twice and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk remains.
We are few, there are only a few astronauts for whom after long flights everything has turned out well, and a healthy generation is growing.
&quot;And if more can be said, it is dangerous even in orbital flights,&quot; sums up pilot cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must look for some new avenues in biotechnology, in radiation protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Center is an obligatory stage in the preparation for the flight.
Under zero-buoyancy conditions, cosmonauts practice their skills working in space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for an adult water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child it is his native element.
The little amphibian-men seem to confirm that life on land arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months inside its mother in the amniotic fluid, since it will be easier for it to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath, only 2 weeks pass.
&quot;This is too little to forget something,&quot; says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming instructor.
In summary, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, gravitation, the force of gravity, is necessary for women.
In weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrepitate very quickly, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, we omit that, relying on the action of labor stimulants.
You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, it will push you.
&quot;And then what?&quot; Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sensation of gravity, the organism does not generate the skeleton or the muscular system.
It is impossible to dress a newborn in orbit in a special suit for training, like adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital for him.
&quot;And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will bring a disabled person to Earth, a totally maladjusted person,&quot; predicts the head of the Institute&#39;s bioethics committee. of biomedical problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical matter.
However, in time this will become a reality, when the humans in their ships head to a distant planet that will be the home for their space-born children.
NKÚ chief: The inspection of the &quot;švarc&quot; system has not found the guilty politician
When it comes to public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its enforcement limps.
This is stated by Miloslav Kala, Vice President of the Supreme Control Office (NKÚ) in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
&quot;The law will never be perfect&quot;, but its application must be correct. &quot;This is, in my opinion, what we lack&quot;, is how he describes the current situation.
Joint checks by Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of wrong practice, he mentions Petr Nečas&#39;s attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the &quot;švarc&quot; system.
The prime minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors. So is it prohibited or allowed?
&quot;The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, not even the president of the government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out said controls or demand obligations,&quot; says Kala.
At the meeting of the control commission in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the common project between the Czech and German teams, within the framework of which the legislation regarding public contracts in both countries was compared.
What exactly?
This is a parallel control that we began to carry out about two years ago.
In a simplified way: European legislation regulates how public contracts must be organized, this is followed by the legislation in force in each country and, later, the praxis itself.
We have put it all together and, although the control has not yet ended, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is &quot;stricter and more complete&quot;, however, the concrete praxis in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is confirmed, then, that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can actually contribute this project? What do you think are the conclusions?
Precisely a common control of this type could help us to stop investing efforts in the concretion of the laws, the reduction and the improvement of the limits, although this does not have such a positive impact.
The thrift economy means getting the right thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest price) in order to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But the fact of reducing the award limit does not mean that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is cluttered with so much &quot;paperwork&quot; that those who want to look for bugs in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now.
You speak of the problems in our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the practice of public adjudications.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKÚ or is it organized differently?
As for the offices, such as the NKÚ, the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors) operates there, with an organization similar to ours, with a college as well, the only thing is that in their case it is structured somewhat differently, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
Also the powers are to some extent analogous, however, as long as Germany has a federal organization, the audit courts are even at this level. In this respect it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Accounts (BRH) can only control federal money, what we call state funds here.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not want to make a comparison without hard data. However, Germany is still a model in some aspects, but it is not possible to specify exactly in which it is better.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors?
Surely not, but, I repeat, I don&#39;t like to make these kinds of comparisons.
It goes without saying that even those countries that we take as a model have to face a large number of problems.
If it were not so, there would be no benefit to them in collaborating with our office, would it?
Regarding the legislation of our country, what did the amendment of the law on public awards mean for your Office? Is its incidence manifested in some way?
Taking into account that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet manifested itself in the control actions.
Since we carry out ex post controls, a certain delay is necessary.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparing future controls: we have started a new &quot;non-economic risk detection&quot; tool, through which we have passed almost 14,000 public contracts, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, since the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process are rectified and similar.
Do you consider that the approval of this law is beneficial or, rather, that it represents a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope it is.
The problem that can arise is that the regulations &quot;harden&quot; and that it is impossible to comply with them.
Already with the previous regulations, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programs of the regional council), and each law not respected in terms of public procurement meant the violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to toughen the law in this way?
I think not this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal mistake, which has no impact on decision making.
Such a system will only succeed in creating more bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We will see where this started path leads us.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the ODS would not bother employers with controls of the so-called švarc system, with reference to being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the švarc&quot; system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, then even the prime minister of the government cannot prevent the action of the Office that has the obligation to carry out such controls and demand obligations.
You can say, &quot;We changed the law and allow it,&quot; but you can&#39;t say we&#39;ll just play it cool.
In the law on public adjudications, the regulations are quite strict regarding the way in which one must act formally. And this is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded for not meeting the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.
The roads present ice sheets, although they are mostly passable
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads are covered with ice and snow sheets.
Although most of the roads are passable, on some, extreme caution must be exercised.
Karlovy Vary Region
This morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but they were icy and snowy.
The temperature drops and will oscillate between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the lower areas the snow cover is thin.
On the other hand, on the crests of the Ore Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the region&#39;s highway operations control center.
The R6 expressway and the first category road in the region are now passable without restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be icy and slippery.
Likewise, all second and third category roads are passable, including mountain roads.
However, in some of them there are still sections with traces of ice and packed snow.
It is necessary to increase attention on the road, especially in the highest areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
There is a danger of frost on some roads in eastern Bohemia and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the tracks, the Directorate for Roads and Motorways reports on its pages.
Highway operators warn drivers about the danger of ice sheets, especially on higher elevations in the Pardubice region.
Frost can occur in the immediate vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on the second and third category roads.
Highways I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads in the mountains from Krkonoše to Orlické hory.
There is a layer of packed snow on the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Bohemia area, the sky will be clear to partly cloudy today, with no precipitation.
The temperatures will generally oscillate between three below zero and a positive degree, a light wind will blow.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are passable this morning, although caution must be exercised and it will be necessary to adapt to the weather.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frost, temperatures will range between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some roads could also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will improve progressively.
This is what emerges from information from the region&#39;s highway operations control center.
The D5 motorway is passable almost without restrictions, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the road between kilometer 80 and 131.
The surface of most of the first category roads is dry and ice free.
In the area of the Pilsen and Tachov highway bordering Germany there may be sections with ice sheets.
The second and third category routes are wet, therefore, in this case, there are also sections with ice sheets.
Drivers should be more prudent, especially on less traveled roads in the Šumava area.
Olomouc region
Drivers heading to the higher elevations of the Olomouc region will encounter partially melted snow.
After chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of Červenohorské and on the track in the direction of Videlský kříž.
Road workers cleared the snow overnight; About three centimeters of snow accumulated on the Šumper road, according to the road managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are passable without restrictions.
&quot;In the higher areas of the Šumper road, traces of snow remain.
Drivers in the Červenohorské pass will encounter half-dried snow in the direction of Jeseník,&quot; an operator from the Šumper highway administration confirmed to ČTK today.
On the ground and at night his colleagues also came to the Jesenická and, after the chemical treatment, the slopes in the higher areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc highway the roads are passable without restrictions, on the Šternberská road drivers should drive with caution in forest sections, where the roads are still wet.
Ústí nad Labem region and Liberec region
Operators of the North Bohemian highways have reported complications on various sections early in the morning.
Apart from a few places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the Ústí nad Labem region is closed.
Temperatures remain below freezing, even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the road. On the other hand, in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech Massif Central, there are no problems and the roads are generally dry.
So far there have been no service complications.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the area around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal overnight. During the day rain and melting snow is expected and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
From the main roads, unfavorable conditions have been announced on the I/13 highway, on the border between the Ústí nad Labem region and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut off by tree branches that had bent over the track under the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in a little less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It is just one of many other alarmist news that we like to cling to.
The Tap Tap music group rather likes to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone or avoid the end of the world.
Also, in December you organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
It&#39;s a state benefit we&#39;ve been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar set for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before, December 20 at 9:00 p.m., we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at approximately the same time the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we forged the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world for our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: boots, t-shirts, bags and original key rings against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The group The Tap Tap, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called hymn against the end of the world, which is entitled &quot;End of the world, cancelled&quot;.
It&#39;s very popular on YouTube right now, will it be heard at benefit concerts?
Of course, and it will be the last one, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn&#39;t end...
All the performers will sing it at the same time in the three concerts.
The hymns will be linked to each other simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics for this song and plays the leading role of Jesus in the video clip, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We even work together with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charity events and concerts...
We put all our efforts into participating in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and have fun working with us.
What will the money raised from the concerts against the end of the world be used for?
To equipment for the Studeo barrier-free educational center, which we completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkův ústav.
The students of the Jedličkův ústav school are regularly visited by teachers with whom they carry out fun and interesting activities.
The students do not have sufficient financial means to pay the teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be a separate building to which we will move with this project.
Various groups and performers perform at each concert.
Which are the selection criteria?
We try to create a program that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform.
For more detailed information, you can consult www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar &quot;spectacular action&quot; planned in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Pražské jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and personally, taking advantage of the fact that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, until now you have performed, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It is not as difficult as it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in an electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which never ceases to amaze me.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to the trips abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you found so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; We in Russia have witnessed that in the East there is still a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there it is still rare for a person to move alone through the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as, for example, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, it is not there.
Luckily, a civil association has been created that makes an effort to make the problems of people with disabilities thematic.
In what aspects should we take the example of more advanced countries?
There are many aspects in which we are behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a severe disability to move on their own in public and to go to the toilet, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, in this regard, with The Tap Tap, we are a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes when eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers emerge, it will really start to change everything.
Until now, they are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we look back a few years, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered Jedličkův ústav as an educator, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play the saxophone among others, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, it got a little out of hand (laughs).
However, popularity did not come until recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that connecting with famous singers and also actively working to promote the group helped us a lot.
We came to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to aid from the European Union, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to go that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that something can be done in a different way.
Show business is full of things that look alike.
It is logical, in its own way, everything new is welcomed with caution and takes a long time to be accepted.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned suffering beings that we should have compassion on.
There are people who are capable of living a full life and developing themselves, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it is not only progress for them, but for the whole of society.
Did the fact that you are a demanding boss, as many people describe you, help?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and demand a certain discipline.
I think it&#39;s completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and their heads in the clouds and when they find out that they have to attend two days of rehearsals, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But that&#39;s how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently the group The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were already there at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group, people come and go, it can&#39;t be helped.
Whoever has the will and desire will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 12.20.2012 at 9:00 p.m.
It will take place in the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda in Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic will participate
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening via videoconference to jointly sing the song by The Tap Tap group &quot;End of the world, cancelled&quot;
The purpose of the concert is to raise the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment of the educational center without barriers STUDEO in Jedličkův ústav in Prague, the cost of which amounts to 25 million CZK.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free entrance in the advance sale option at Bohemiaaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency countries held last week, Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of ESA. It is the second ESA member country from the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on November 12, 2008).
Poland began an intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the following years participated in the agency&#39;s project committee.
However, Poland&#39;s path to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in spaceflight before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, A. Šternfeld&#39;s lecture at the Warsaw astronomical observatory in which, on December 6, 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study &quot;Introduction to Cosmonautics&quot;.
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the attendees indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize in France for his &quot;Introduction to Cosmonautics&quot;.
Doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, he was known throughout the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named after him.
Already in the year 1925 a train was built in Poland that was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is unknown who the author of the proposal was and the details of the project are not known either.
It is not clear if the rocket was going to be used to start the car or to stop it.
Information about this carriage is limited to what was reported in the press of the time.
From the year 1933 the Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to missiles.
The research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it becomes clear that the investigation reached the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937, the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by the engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study &quot;Rakieta - torpedo powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza&quot; by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was in charge of all projects on missile techniques for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the start of the war.
Other studies devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The society was first referenced in the November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine with four very long articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, from prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time, projects for artificial satellites had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to become part of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA was significantly involved in the development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) sounding rocket, which was a success and became the first Polish rocket on which scientific research was carried out.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had an apogee of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the construction of the RM-1A version was finished and in the summer of 1959 air tests of the RM-2 two-stage rockets began in the Błędów desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket in development was to be the subject of actual scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was going to have an apogee of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, in 1962 the works were suspended.
The successor to the first rockets of the RM type was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and a starting weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (named Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, differing from each other in the space available for scientific apparatus.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for the volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum apogee in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first air tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg up to 60 km in altitude.
Subsequently the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 version was built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national COSPAR committee two years later.
Within the framework of the Interkosmos program, Poland joined the cosmic space investigation on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimír Remek.
The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the social work law.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
Of course it will be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of more economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with rampant financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labor cost (wages) produces economic stress.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, by importing cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and to do so &quot;causes a drop&quot; in the competitor&#39;s price with the aim of taking over the majority of the market and, Thus, you increase your profit margin.
On a large scale means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buying cheaper there, or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labor, compared to other economies, is higher.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and, therefore, is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the state&#39;s social spending necessarily grows.
This whole situation favors the total disinterest of businessmen in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage that they have caused in their eagerness to obtain benefits.
The situation is universally so well known that it is not necessary to present specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the objective of artificially lowering the social level of their own population and, in this way, attracting foreign capital to the market. country.
Put another way, governments make private capital available to their own population without regard to social decline.
This becomes evident especially in the changes of the current laws.
The goal is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the economic obligation system in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the restricted right of employees in terms of labor rights.
The result is growing poverty along with widening gaps between rich and poor.
For a number of years there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot support themselves with their own work.
The number of people who receive this type of help already reaches one million.
Within the framework of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, a quite frequent case occurs: people employed with such a low salary that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
One such scandal related to the situation of auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
The saving measures of practically all the southern states of the EU lead, without a doubt, to the same situation. People, pressured by an abysmal decline in their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to live poorly with a lousy salary on the edge of society, hoping that one day private investment capital will arrive in the country.
Is it necessary to wonder where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never arrives, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny part of a European salary.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media say ad nauseam that the state should not provide capital to the economy, that running the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends tooth and nail the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling with control.
Next, it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence the political march with its selfishness and, therefore, the entire state.
In this case the answer is clearly affirmative.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the field of corruption, in mutual favors, in a legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but is not punishable.
In Germany the situation is as follows: State ministries, lacking financial means, entrust the drafting of bills to private legal firms, which are often linked to industry.
These types of bills are then approved in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation like the one described by Appianos in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Times of Caesar and Pompeii: &quot;The state had been disintegrating for some time and the administrations took over by force &quot;.
In exchange for bribes, illegitimately obtained favors, and help to finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread without any impediment and people went to the polls with the vote agreed in advance&quot;... &quot;there were no people with character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of Because of this disorganization, the state spent eight months without consuls&quot;... &quot;Serious talk began that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man&quot;... Although Appianos was thinking of Pompeii , Caesar rose to power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, in the same way as in antiquity, is that today&#39;s society is based on inconsiderate preferences for individual benefit without taking into account common interests.
Private capital is not capable, in its essence, of understanding and claiming the benefits of all of society.
The result is the same as then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without an effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of the fascist and communist regimes must be sought, therefore, in the rampant liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal-type democracy, as a definite pause, waiting for the next coup.
The truly devastating fact is that today&#39;s elite are completely ignorant of the hundreds of thousands of lives lost, social and humanitarian catastrophes that we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity as we know them in ancient history and the most recent.
The suspension of the law on public contracts is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for other ways to lower the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution lies in concrete socio-political reforms, which reinforce both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in the government, and which weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society to the benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
&quot;That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could&quot; (Nothing arises from violence and nothing could), Sting in his song Fragile and whose chorus reads &quot;Let&#39;s do not forget how fragile we are&quot; (let&#39;s not forget how fragile what are we).
&quot;If my children did not want wars, there would be none&quot; Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on her deathbed in 1849.
After the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, mixed reactions have emerged, as always.
One, on the side of Israel, argues in favor of the right of self-defense and pigeonholes the Palestinians in the role of terrorists. The other supports the Palestinians and alleges racism on the part of the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and calls Israel a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the regularly repeated massacres and who is the victim. After all, today&#39;s citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginnings of the violence.
My intent is to give readers a look behind the scenes, a look to find out who is profiting from the tensions that have raged for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) on a small tract of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions that I have reached based on my own understanding of the matter, about who or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
In the history of humanity, the history of struggles for power is in the first row.
In each era we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether these characters were always the ones who directed their steps autonomously or if behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions towards a certain objective.
We must accept that we live in an age that concentrates the world&#39;s wealth in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies has not been achieved in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, one stands out that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind it, I do not know, but I do not rule it out): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Naturally.
In the 1990s they bought the first news agency (Reuters) so that they would stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant strengthening.
They have significant stakes in almost all the central banks in the world and in those countries where they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after to overthrow Gaddafi there were only four left, but in the meantime Russia has subjugated the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Rothschild central bank Bank of America, began printing money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK started printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the Fed for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their desire for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by the Freemason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33rd degree.
The first war was marked as an objective to eliminate the great monarchical states in all of Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially of Great Britain, and the third proposed to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and a billion people (such a number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would be enough and they would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a blueprint for such a solution) and the definitive adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the group of the richest families operates, together with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of the unleashing of crises and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab cao - order out of chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a worsening of the situation. If not, it is enough to remember that the FED was created so that a crisis like that of 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the successful assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, and after the outbreak of World War I as a result, they tore Tsarist Russia apart with the start of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustifiably from the military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end Czarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the empire Austro-Hungarian.
To prepare the ground for World War II, they allowed bankers and politicians to covertly create a conflict situation in the wake of the massive war reparations imposed on Germany, thus creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, it was enough for them to serve the Germans the Führer&#39;s solution, which was strong and simple enough and pointed out the culprits, and then build a Czechoslovakia made up of several nationalities with a strong German minority that had to represent and represented so well the function of the fifth column, which lit the flame and caused the outbreak of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration laid the foundations for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place began.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out: it&#39;s hard to know if Hitler pulled too far on the string by which the international bankers originally tied him, or if everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way the war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, the proclamation of the state of Israel created the focus for a third war.
If the international bankers succeed in starting it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a casualty in the front line of combat, now along with the Arab or, more generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding and chaos machine, not only within the framework of its country, but also on an international scale. Let us take as an example how sympathizers and detractors of Israel are sharply divided.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Where injustice begets injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of everything was the greed of some individuals and their desire for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in elections.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), it would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of all world oil passes (the shipping corridor has only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words uttered by David Rockefeller in 1994 now shown: &quot;All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order.&quot;
The new world order in his imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-to-do financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls their entire being.
&quot;And it forces everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the numbers of your name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has half a brain, add the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six.&quot;
Movie Argo: If It Gets Raw, Call Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of the Islamist student demonstration occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who fled to the US after the revolution, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation did not offer any positive prospects: throwing the shah overboard could not afford it, since doing so would jeopardize the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within his reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later further intensified by the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the Algerian government.
In the US, his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure in Iran was instrumental in Jimmy Carter&#39;s defeat by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film &quot;Argo&quot; by director and actor Ben Affleck thematizes an episode of this story, which achieved little success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees of the building escaped.
After a complicated journey, they ended up at the residence of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, for this an extravagant point was helped by an undercover story: they left with Canadian passports, as members of the film crew that was examining the location in the country for the filming of a science fiction blockbuster .
mix of genres
The plan drawn up by &quot;exfiltration&quot; expert Toni Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood.
To make the lie seem true, the film project was written about in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictitious production company even had a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck&#39;s film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called &quot;caper movie&quot;, the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example could be the series Ocean&#39;s Eleven).
In the film the moods are combined. On the one hand, we find well-documented sequences from Tehran. In the credits sequence, emblematic photographs of the time of the events are shown, which were captured in the same way in the film; There are not many differences in this respect.
On the other, somewhat lighter typical Hollywood scenes, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And also, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: men in suits analyzing the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been the object of ridicule, has become a respectable director and his way of acting is no longer the target of ironic comments.
Argo is her third feature film, after &quot;Goodbye Little Girl, Goodbye&quot; (2007) and the thriller &quot;The Town. City of Thieves&quot; (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck&#39;s first film in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.
Likewise, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that placed the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck demonstrates it in Argo, where Tehran is &quot;shot&quot; in Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of true events. The introductory sequence of the seizure of the embassy is impressive due to its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, conveys the emotion of bewilderment and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the impostor team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to come to terms with the fact that an explained story doesn&#39;t offer much in the cinematic sense of the more intriguing scenes.
And he manages quite well. Sometimes it adds something to the reality: here everything does not go so elegantly (the scene in which the crisis lurks in the Tehran airport, the diverting of a call to America and the frantic search on its trail become crazy ).
Argo&#39;s weakness is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and they are by no means the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck&#39;s film loses a bit of its dramatic character, but it is a film that can be followed with moderate interest, appreciating its production and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But let it collapse, that will be difficult.
As an evocation of a true story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which every year presents a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce the contest on &quot;the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU workshop&quot;.
&quot;It occurred to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a quota of 40 percent of women in management positions in large European companies,&quot; explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities mentioned is, for example, the recent decision of the European court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women have taken advantage of better prices in life insurance because they objectively represent less risk.
&quot;Other amazing ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year.&quot;
The election will take place at the end of February 2013,&quot; reported Nacher.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the mandatory addition of bio-components to fuel which, as a result, harms the environment; another prohibition is the use of traditional mercury thermometers just because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the guideline on the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year .
The factual prohibition of using the expression &quot;butter spread&quot; or the withdrawal of the classic light bulb from shops has been criticized.
A quality banana should have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus often makes these kinds of decisions under pressure from one or another business or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of a veto, vindicates the demands of its banks).
Lobbying interests were behind the demand, for example, that the highest quality bananas in the EU must be at least 14 centimeters long and not show &quot;abnormal curvatures.&quot;
The European Commission defended itself by saying that with this it only seeks to harmonize the national standards that have not been homogenized to date, which only complicated their commercialization.
The rules that refer to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been relaxed on the grounds that the existing directive leads to a waste of groceries.
The candidate to win the survey could be the EU prescription from last year according to which inflatable balloons on the market are required to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU was referring here to an American study according to which, when it comes to toys, balloons are the main cause of infant death from suffocation.
A similar restriction is also in effect applicable to the use of blowouts by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation regarding European civil servants: anyone who has any official function in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. In order not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, one should speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member state .
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry into the EU.
Then, for example, the Czech Republic exceeded the set volume for canned mushrooms, threatening a substantial fine.
The survey organizers were also interested in the idea of paying landlocked countries and the idea of awarding a grant for grant applications.
These kinds of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
&quot;We are at a disadvantage due to the fact that we do not have the sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation,&quot; declared the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued it with the fact that in our country a lot of cereal was produced and, as a consequence of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full warehouses and it had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended for the drafting of applications for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
Member state guidelines are often the target of criticism, the EU&#39;s regulatory efforts and more effective operation and development across the Union rather deserve, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which the member states have obtained in budget negotiations.
The Czechs also feel a sensitive chord, in the same way as other countries of the Union, the fight for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious in these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with the Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the Olomouc cottage cheese, but they had to change the name of the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and was renamed &quot;tuzemák&quot;.
Only products made from the distillate of sugar cane can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beets.
In the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, together with the feta and gorgonzola cheeses known throughout the world, the marzipan from the German city Lübeck or the Parma ham, there are already, for example, Karlovy Vary biscuits, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň and even the hop variety from Žatec.
As protected EU gangs, they can be proud of Pardubice gingerbread and Hořice v Podkrkonoší wafers.
People want me to save the republic, but I&#39;m an amateur, says Okamura
Mr. Senator, how did it occur to you to run for president?
It&#39;s not about being a senator or president.
If everything went well in our country, then I would not present my candidacy.
But I can no longer bear to see how theft in the last twenty years in our country, how the thieves go unpunished, how taxes and retirement age are increased.
He had no ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something I don&#39;t like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I am already forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to run as senator or president.
He has already reached the Senate, but shortly after he has set out on his way to the presidency.
Are you not turning your back on those people who have voted for you?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the senate elections.
Later I specified that if I was elected senator, I would present my candidacy for the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That&#39;s why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticize at the bar or in front of the television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to initiate change.
Added to this is the media, which discredits you and confuses freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
It is said about me that I have bribed journalists or that I have been an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let&#39;s talk about your ideas.
He presents himself to the presidential fight with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of property above twenty million.
To do this, the law must change.
As president he does not have this power and only the senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group for the profession of guide to be recognized as freelance work, and we achieved it.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, whether from the right or the left, it is rejected on purpose and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to win the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without pigeonholes or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more of a man of the right or of the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more to the left.
It doesn&#39;t matter to me whether it&#39;s a bit left or a bit right.
What matters to me is that we get ahead.
I don&#39;t care if someone is left or right, I want to bring people together.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and likewise I will be against bad ideas.
You make a joke when it is said of you that you are a populist.
But isn&#39;t he showing it with what he says?
When creating a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you try to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals that I am talking about already work in the world or well-known experts talk about them.
But without the support of parliament, only slogans remain.
And with that it cannot survive in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial liability?
I do not have any other option.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to achieve it.
If he were elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for state politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And, eventually, they would have to communicate why they don&#39;t want it.
If there is a strong character who points out the disputes, pressure can be put on the political scene.
Take for example the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I affirm that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to find allies.
I am just starting out in politics and trying to get as much support as possible for my show.
I try to pull things off myself, but if it doesn&#39;t work out, I&#39;ll quit in six years and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that with a person I do nothing, that is why I have visited a series of well-known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to present their candidacy for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he was very busy.
For my part, I have at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the frauds involving light heating oils.
I ran on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I&#39;m in the balance.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls, and those who did voted for representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two from the independent sector.
The people elected the senate, so it will be hard to get change.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven&#39;t considered it yet because I don&#39;t have time for it, to check the spotless past of each potential party member, nor do I have money.
I don&#39;t even have money for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
Does not have money?
Talk about property statements, how is yours?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a piece of land valued at 25 million, a flat valued at 10 million, another flat valued at 8 million, a collection of works of art worth 10 million, an Aston Martin worth about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued at in a million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream when I was young. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was gallant to women and, at the same time, fought against evil and injustice.
You drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and you have no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don&#39;t want to put too much money on your part.
It&#39;s not very convincing.
I don&#39;t have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to borrow?
In the campaign I have already put 2.5 million.
The fact that I don&#39;t have any sponsors shows that there isn&#39;t much interest in my show.
And I have no obligation to pay for the campaign with money from my pocket.
Campaign expenses essentially cover what I will receive as a senator&#39;s salary.
But I couldn&#39;t live on it. For example, I couldn&#39;t afford my son&#39;s English school, which costs 30,000 kroner per month.
If I only wanted to make money, then I wouldn&#39;t run for office.
So you will continue with your business activity to be able to live?
Didn&#39;t you say before that you were going to leave this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As promised, I have partly stopped my activities.
For example, my travel agency representative will become my replacement in the spring.
The people would want him to be the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much do you usually earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I keep earning.
If I were president, then I would go out of business.
You can read the whole interview in the Saturday edition of Práva.
The architecture firm MVRDV proves that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the recently completed &quot;mountain of books&quot;- 2 photos
&quot;I think the building is fun, it&#39;s futuristic looking, and finally there&#39;s something interesting to see,&quot; says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the street.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large company located near the library, notes: &quot;plus, the building is nice.&quot;
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have the Internet, tablets and e-books.
No one enters those old-fashioned libraries for pleasure, right?
Spijkenisse, a commuter town located at the gates of Rotterdam that is hardly worth a fleeting visit, holds the dubious honor of having set a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counteract this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to somehow contribute to general culture and copy the seven fictional bridges that appear on euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that&#39;s how the policy makers decided that there was only one possibility to improve the statistics: you had to build a library!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a true master of the art of bar charts and responsible for buildings that are both fun and cynical, took up the subject with his usual serenity and appeared at the competition presentation in the year 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked around in puzzlement and shrugged, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size into a pyramid and concluded his short speech with the following words: &quot;Dear fellow citizens:
Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books in Spijkenisse, the so-called `Boekenberg&#39;&quot;.
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros rises in the planned place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is complete with an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential and semi-detached buildings.
At the beginning of November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize &quot;Best Library of NL 2012&quot;.
In addition, the project is also nominated for the &quot;Dutch National Wood Award 2012&quot;.
In this way, the small town devoid of history, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white façade one would rather guess a dairy, now has a work of architecture contemporary.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it is a book paradise under a cheese dish.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountainous massif, but true lovers of space and reading do not use it, preferring to merge with its topography at each step of their climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy on the eye, the annealed brick floor and elegant street lamps unequivocally supporting the library&#39;s public status.
The urban environment is perfect.
When you look up you can see the park benches, the dogs and the boys and girls playing soccer.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
&quot;Usually the bookcases are arranged along the façade and in the middle opens a huge dark room, which is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal,&quot; says Winy Maas.
What we have done is turn the classic spatial configuration upside down and take the reading area from inside to outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserves the black shelves that assume the functions of wall covering, parapet and railing at the same time.
Sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even the most up-to-date architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
&quot;We wanted to work with recycled materials,&quot; explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in the town of Spijkenisse.
And that&#39;s how one day, on a Frisian farm, we came across the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, a few millimeters thick plastic fabric has been used in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a base to hold the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine tissue lasts two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library, this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, until obtaining sheets four centimeters thick.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a mixture of a new car and a sneaker.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain, the reward awaits us: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but you can also enjoy tasty Dutch croquettes and its planted ficus. in huge pots.
These create a pleasant environment while maintaining adequate atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
&quot;Although it is hard to believe given its large glass surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,&quot; says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Despite the fact that the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden trusses located transversally to the glass façade serve to provide shade and absorb most of the sun&#39;s rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is up to the automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical worker in the Information Technology sector, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has been there too.
Likewise, the professor of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She calls the &quot;Boekenberg&quot; the &quot;late soul&quot; of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way, it is intended to fill, for the moment, the optical gaps of a library that still does not have its complete archive; currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has caught on.
The shelves are full.
&quot;There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,&quot; says architect Winy Maas.
&quot;I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link with this building.
Everyone knows that their book is part of the library.
Even if it&#39;s just there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV studio has achieved great success in this reigning discipline known in specialized jargon as &quot;identity creation&quot;.
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of literary history.
Regardless of how young and uneducated he may be.
Finally a starting point to shape your identity.
Szabo: &quot;The Germans must play a more leading role&quot;
Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, this puts Berlin in a tricky diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier in the week, Germany hinted that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories United Nations observer state status.
Ultimately, however, Berlin abstained.
Because?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, because of the country&#39;s special relationship with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I don&#39;t think it supports the US position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising that took place in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position when important international issues are at stake?
Yes that&#39;s how it is.
This is because it is currently reorienting its foreign policy away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and towards a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that the Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans find themselves at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to doing so.
I think they are still feeling their role, but they are already on the path to a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to that of countries like France or Great Britain.
What exactly does a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, that is, in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers and for this reason Germany must protect their interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken regarding the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, it must be careful not to alienate itself from Arab public opinion or even from Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give it so much importance since it is not a totally one-sided relationship.
However, they do play a pivotal role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the US by abstaining from voting on major decisions like the Palestine vote?
I think that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I don&#39;t think there has been as sharp a breakout as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps with this Germany has managed to earn a certain respect.
After all, all this has only shown that it is a country that is taken seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the US has come out clearly in favor of a veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of US domestic politics.
I think the Obama administration secretly shows great understanding of the European position.
But, because of the political situation that exists here, it is evident that the government cannot defend this position in public.
I believe that the true disparity of opinions does not really have the magnitude that is attributed to it.
If we analyze the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he is developing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a superior entity, but must drive things from their own position.
That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, whether simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a tricky subject.
But I think the Germans are clear that they have to play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of a major international player? Does Germany really want to take a leading role?
Or perhaps you still find it difficult to accept that leadership?
Germany still hasn&#39;t gotten used to it, it&#39;s always a bit awkward and, for obvious reasons, the country still struggles to play a bigger role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as the main player, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
It is an old problem and it is that nobody wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Seen in this light, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
You have to be receptive to different neighbors and opinions, and that&#39;s not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics is diminishing more and more, but the EU does not fill that gap at the moment, who is left then?
The Germans will have no choice but to assume a more leading role.
Even if they don&#39;t like it, if they find it unpleasant or if it makes them an even more unpopular people, c&#39;est la vie!

&quot;Brand protection&quot; in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a globally known brand and Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this name is a name officially registered in China that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it is protected as long as the true eponyms do not file a lawsuit.
And even then it is not clear that they will be proved right.
&quot;Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,&quot; says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the Taylor Wessing law firm specializing in copyright violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case arrives at my table.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters in order to register their trademarks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and Prada-Kny is registered instead of Prada.
German companies also copy legally in the same way, as has happened to the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet in which he keeps entries from the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the Zegna DF Puma brand, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are department stores with several floors dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, the Pattloch cases are of a different nature. On behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to profit from a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it &quot;Bang Ming Pai&quot; or companion mark.
The word originates from the Chinese term &quot;Bang Dakuan&quot;,
which refers to women who have &quot;fished&quot; a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
&quot;It&#39;s bad for business, you have to fight it,&quot; Pattloch demands.
&quot;The brand is leaking, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage suffered by the image is enormous.&quot;
The financial losses and legal costs of the affected sectors are in the millions, especially in the case of emblematic luxury products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of 15,000 million euros per year, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
However, achieving the annulment of registrations of dubious legality in the trademark registry is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
The processes can last up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch talks about cases where the court dismissed a lawsuit because so much time had elapsed that the name in the lawsuit had already become a &quot;market reality.&quot;
&quot;If the plaintiff is unlucky, they may even have to pay money to the plagiarist because the process has damaged the plagiarist&#39;s brand in China,&quot; Pattloch says.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been taken over by the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That is why today the Chinese can continue to use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo buyer Geely initially used a blue and white logo that was largely reminiscent of BMW; the matter went to court and Geely had to amend it.
Clothing maker Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo depicted a crocodile facing the opposite direction from the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing acknowledges that in 2010 they had difficulties due to a shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, &quot;the labor emergency situation returned to normal.&quot;
In this way, the number of unprocessed claim processes has been reduced by 22%.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending resolution.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As usual in China, the numbers are staggering.
Last year the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and means that China leads the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, according to the trademark office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, a figure that amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, they would have pocketed 1.8 billion yuan in rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese impersonator.
Although the Germans have succeeded in stopping the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the copycat has managed to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
&quot;We ourselves have caused this situation because surnames are not protected in Germany,&quot; says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office also dismissed the Munich appeal.
In the next two instances they have agreed with Freudenberg, but the opposing party is still fighting today.
You have to be very careful
Now the case has reached the doors of the Superior Court of Justice, where it is still pending resolution.
Wentzler is confident that he can resolve the issue favorably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that &quot;the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time.&quot;
Internal costs are difficult to estimate; The business archive has had to review files that are up to a hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposing party a &quot;six-figure sum in euros&quot; with the aim of reaching an amicable agreement, but was unsuccessful.
&quot;This shows how much we care,&quot; Wentzler says.
The dangers lurking in the Far East even threaten Europe,
specifically if imitators secure the rights to unprotected trademarks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register the Freudenberg name for shoes and leather goods in Germany.
The group has long since abandoned this commercial field, however it managed to prevent registration.
&quot;You have to be extremely careful,&quot; Wentzler says.
Both he and attorney Pattloch advise German companies to be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international legislation on trademark rights, but what must be done is &quot;also register in China everything that may be susceptible to protection&quot;, as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the theme can turn out to be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the last round of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party license fees for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: dance, sing, help
In Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses and in Swaziland AIDS orphans rejoice
The story of a bond capable of overcoming much more than 8,733 kilometers of distance.
First you start with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, high heels and loafers search for the beat on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the singers&#39; voices (alto, bass, tenor and soprano) begin to rise slowly, swirling, dulling and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to go off the deep end trying to bring order with his soft, energetic gestures.
It&#39;s Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute for Medical Psychology the Imbongi Choir is rehearsing a new song.
The fifty singers have also arrived, between the ages of 23 and 69, from the human geneticist to the householder.
&quot;Om&#39;Obani&quot; is not an easy piece, each voice in the choir has a different text and also in a barely known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations program to fight AIDS, around the world there are approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV positive.
The Voices for Africa association has found sponsors in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover school tuition, uniform and will guarantee you one hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means &quot;storyteller&quot; or &quot;panegyrist&quot; in Zulu.
In this room no one knows how to speak this Bantu language fluently, but they do know how to sing.
For ten years this choir has been rehearsing songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: southern Africa.
8,733 kilometers as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a town called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what ails Swaziland: the highest AIDS infection rate and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The population does not look favorably on circumcision, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of contagion.
More than 40% of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying in their thirties has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this remote town, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the chances in a poor country are more than slim.
In the beginning, it was only the private commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; which has since professionally cared for AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STDs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
The most common STDs of viral origin are AIDS, the human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Crabs and scabies are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur more often in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five syphilis cases reported in Germany originate from sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomonas, human papillomavirus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea.
HIV transmission among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been on a downward trend since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were registered.
This is one tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
Often they do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore go undetected.
How can one protect oneself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Some sexually transmitted disease pathogens can also be transmitted through infections from dirt and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if you frequently change sexual partners.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any late consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees the choir charges for their performances throughout Germany, they manage to raise quite a bit of money.
&quot;In total we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, president of the association, proudly.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman with leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
She sees to it that the orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The &quot;gogos&quot;, as older women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their care, offer them a roof to live in and ensure that the children come to school on time every day and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who are in charge of cooking every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, &quot;Voices of Africa&quot; has started a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, in collaboration with the US health organization PSI, has managed to get many of the villagers tested for HIV.
This is not something obvious, since, despite how evident this disease is throughout the country, it is not usually talked about openly.
A king with 14 wives
&quot;AIDS is an absolute taboo,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it has to do with sexuality.&quot;
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle full of excess.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This officially unaccepted way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread of the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless seasonal workers who travel the country from one side to the other and who take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, &quot;Condoms can be found for free on any street corner, but they are rarely used.
It&#39;s another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact.&quot;
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels every two or three years through southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, fighting spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still Remember the apartheid era.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; So much recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but it has also managed to bring a couple of tears to the occasional angry border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit sponsored children.
Although this small town hardly appears on maps, it is well known in the Ezulweni river valley.
&quot;Go to Esitjeni, the light shines there,&quot; say the locals.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers in a straight line back to Heidelberg to the Bergheimer Strasse rehearsal rooms packed with stepping singers, one realizes that it is possible to see their light shine from there too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet is probably up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the North American space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the closest planet to the sun, there is also frozen water there, as can be seen from three studies published Thursday in the specialized magazine &quot;Science&quot;.
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that an ice cap has formed in the permanently shadowed area of the planet.
It appears that this one is at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water presumably comes from comets or, with high probability, from asteroids that once collided with Mercury.
No one connects the ice finding with the possibility of life on the planet, says Messenger lead investigator Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other components of life have reached other parts of the solar system.
Completely unnoticed by the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images back to Earth: little windows into the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, Ceres is not a &quot;planet&quot; under the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006.
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a &quot;family portrait&quot; showing infinite generations of stars: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, but the hardest to recognize is the pink color of the stars. &quot;newborn&quot; stars.
Unromantically named W5 by scientists, this star-forming region was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This iridescent image of a dying star was taken by NASA&#39;s Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made up of the material that the star spits out in its extinction process.
In the enormous Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are forming from gas and dust.
NASA&#39;s Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic star-forming zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known by the nickname &quot;The Seven Sisters&quot;, are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to a land continent has earned it the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image results in spectacular colouring.
This fledgling star could be captured in all its splendor for the first time by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
It is probably the remains of one of Saturn&#39;s moons that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest pictures taken by the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy.
Depending on the tonalities, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin term &quot;trifidus&quot; (divided into three), as dark dust lanes divide the fiery heart of this star-forming zone into three lobes.
In the Ophiuchus constellation, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two galaxies in the process of merging rush towards each other to end up colliding irremediably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the nickname of Molinillo Austral.
This Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula located 1,400 light years away is made up of dust particles whose size is between ten and one hundred times smaller than that of the dust particles that we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and x-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, named Arp 273, served for a time as a model for NASA&#39;s Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the group of brightest young stars in our Milky Way.
This star-forming zone is constantly producing new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosette Nebula, new stars also continually emerge; 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this very bright galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, only gas.
The researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when hydrogen was mostly found in the universe.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope appears to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us have more and more depth.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope is erected.
This allows us to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
The drawback of this cheaper construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radio telescope, researchers can explore the universe in search of signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the &quot;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence&quot; (SETI for its acronym in English) can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing power.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that lives up to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or Extremely Large European Telescope).
Its primary mirror will span 42 meters and will be made up of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected to be able to take images.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
On Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is a picture of what it would look like.
However, the most important information about the cosmos comes to us from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been sending images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that since the start of its mission, 1,235 planet candidates had been located.
The image shows the final preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not launch into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers start from the assumption that there is also ice at Mercury&#39;s south pole.
However, there is no convincing evidence, since the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
Radar measurements have been pointing to the existence of ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain that this is the case.

The minibus rumbles through the winding road past wooded hills, fast-flowing rivers and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that one is in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
The &quot;talyshi&quot; live here, a people about whom not much is known, apart from the fact that they are perfectly fluent in Persian and Azeri and that they are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts a perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fit quite in such a picturesque mountainous landscape.
European tourists rarely come to this place, since the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate both urban centers, it takes eight hours because the road is one way.
The amazing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to the oil from the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
&quot;Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world,&quot; says Fatulayeva.
This is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one that exists in the world.
Here the lives of eight dozen local talyshis who have exceeded 100 years of age are documented. Fatulayeva points to a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
A son of his died at the age of 136
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the sheep herder Şirali Müslümov, who appears to have lived for 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate that certifies it.
And if we take into account that the oldest documented man lived to be 122 years old, it seems that Müslümov&#39;s age is quite suspect.
&quot;He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973,&quot; explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently she still had time to conceive one more daughter at the age of 136.
Has Şirali Müslümov been wrong then in his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian inhabitant.
&quot;In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, there are also very old people living,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;even in Sardinia there are many older men.&quot;
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; especially when there is no civil registry either.
Every day full glasses of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik tend to reach a biblical age.
Currently there are 20 people who are over 100 years of age.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
Azeri tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of the Talyshis.
The director of the museum, Mrs. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the high-calorie diet of the Talyshi, who adore meat, bread and, above all, dairy products and many of whom also drink a glass of melted butter, be so healthy.
Or maybe it is the natural way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years old, he is relatively young for what is customary in these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, she tirelessly moves a huge tub of butter.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva&#39;s sons and a daughter, both of whom became grandparents long ago.
Two small children are also jumping up and down.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that they serve in typical dome-shaped glasses.
Mirzayeva&#39;s teeth are white and perfectly aligned, and under her scarf she hides two long braids of dark blonde hair that her son proudly reveals to us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so it has never fallen out and has kept its color.
&quot;I&#39;ve never used a shampoo either,&quot; says Mirzayeva.
The pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In all my life I have never gone to a supermarket to do the shopping.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the time after World War II.
However, everything returned to normal when the &quot;dear father&quot;, Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird coming from an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult of the nation&#39;s father figure, who runs his country like a dictator, knows no bounds.
He remained in power until 2003, at which time he handed over the baton to his son Ilham.
At least older people in Azerbaijan don&#39;t know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount that can be lived well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva&#39;s gray-haired son is right: &quot;in our culture, elders are highly respected.&quot;
They live in a big family, they are loved, they receive all the necessary care and they are happy.
As if this wasn&#39;t reason enough to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression &quot;Human Rights&quot;
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivaling demonstrations in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in which the country is mired.
The future constitution, based on sharia, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president spared no pathos.
&quot;We must overcome the transition.
And that this happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God,&quot; he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to the entire people, especially to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and secularists.
All of them, until now hopelessly mired in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost apologizing, he has had to temporarily annul the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his own &quot;in order to save the revolution.&quot;
Yet neither the Egyptians nor the entire world quite know what this 61-year-old engineer with a Ph.D. from the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
Indeed, the 234 articles, which have been forced through a constituent assembly of 100 predominantly Islamist members in a 15-hour nightly meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that the jurisprudence is based on the &quot;principles of Islamic law.&quot;
However, what does that &quot;principles&quot; mean?
This was and remains open to interpretation and it appears that Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, and the legal leeway that comes with it, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia.
This is at least what a new added article suggests: in all questions relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power in all Sunni Islamism.
This does not have to be the case, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that would - in effect - result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it claims to maintain military jurisdiction.
During the Mubarak dictatorship, these courts were used to exert harsh repression on the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the draft establishes, the State must protect &quot;the true essence of the Egyptian family&quot; and &quot;promote its morals and values&quot;.
This is such an imprecise formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Speaking clearly, it is not about anything other than censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
On the other hand, another prohibits offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his legacies.
However, it is not clear what an offense is and how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the formulation that prohibits &quot;offending people&quot;
Is a caricature of the president or a joke about a lawyer enough?
A question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for his signature and that, according to his words, &quot;very soon&quot; will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to a referendum.
&quot;The Revolution Has Returned&quot;
For weeks the opposition has been closing ranks against the superiority of the Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Carlo&#39;s Tahrir Square and vowed to defeat the Act before it could enter into force.
&quot;The revolution has returned and we will end up winning,&quot; says Hamdin Sabbahi, who is third on the list for the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the draft constitution should be &quot;in the dustbin of history.&quot;
Through Twitter, he accused Mursi&#39;s followers of wanting to lead a &quot;coup against democracy.&quot;
&quot;When he calls the referendum we will go to his palace and overthrow him,&quot; says opposition figure Jasser Said.
&quot;We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for,&quot; opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted as saying in Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not want to supervise the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
&quot;The Qur&#39;an is our constitution&quot;
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-demonstration; just in case, not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, in front of Cairo University.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in it shouting: &quot;the people demand the application of divine law&quot;.
They demanded that Mursi &quot;cleanse the country&quot;, while proclaiming: &quot;the Koran is our constitution&quot;.
A fight for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Clearly Mursi&#39;s supporters did not want to risk something like this happening.
The Muslim brothers claimed that both those who opposed the draft constitution and those who supported it would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now would have come the time to let the people decide at the ballot box which direction the country should go.
In this sense, it seems that the Islamists&#39; draft is guaranteed a majority.
&quot;The expression &#39;Human Rights&#39; does not even appear&quot;
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that actually should have lasted until February and included all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or faced trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him Human Rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
&quot;And now the expression &#39;Human Rights&#39; does not even appear in the new constitution&quot;, he laments in a conversation with the newspaper &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot;.
The extension of Mursi&#39;s powers to the three powers of the State made this lawyer resign.
The measures adopted are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
&quot;Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it,&quot; laments Saeda.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which is watching the ideological struggle taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: &quot;You are conceiving a monster that you will not be able to control.&quot;
Norwegian rakfisk: the smelliest fish in the world?
Norway&#39;s five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country&#39;s success has something to do with its craving for extremely smelly fish?
Take a series of over-cured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mound of wet, dirty soccer gear.
Leave it there for a week.
You will then be able to smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway&#39;s delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It&#39;s snowy. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout that is left to ferment in water for, depending on how smelly you prefer it, up to a year.
As it gets darker and colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes dedicated to this most, so to speak, captivating delicacy.
&quot;You eat it raw and then you drink a glass of aquavit in one gulp,&quot; says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also known as the &quot;Rakfisk General&quot; who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is kept in small buckets and downing large amounts of the drink in one gulp.
&quot;Some people like aquavit better than rakfisk,&quot; says Havard.
The drink can kill the smell.
I try a few pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it&#39;s not bad; not unlike a slice of sushi that has traveled a few miles on the bus.
Rakfisk is a product from a very different time, when poverty plagued Norway and, before refrigeration, fish was stored during the autumn submerged in water and salt in airtight barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is taken out and, evidently with the senses inactive due to the alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, emigrating mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is increasing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high salaries and a comprehensive system of social services.
A stream of people from Sweden, the old rival and until not too long ago much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
Rakfisk is considered something important, an essential, if rather smelly, part of Norway&#39;s past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But in fact, everything is expensive. A beer or a sandwich costs you a whopping €10 ($14) each.
Norway rarely appears on the international news agenda, and most Norwegians like it that way.
People here are still loath to utter the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who gunned down and murdered 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as &quot;the event of July 22.&quot;
Norwegians have a hard time believing that in their peaceful country one of their own would be capable of committing such cruelty and murder.
Behind much of Norway&#39;s wealth today has been the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world&#39;s largest oil and gas industries.
&quot;But oil isn&#39;t the only reason we&#39;re doing so well,&quot; says Anna, our waitress, passing trays of rakfisk, the epitome of Norwegian well-being with her long blonde hair and striking blue eyes. .
&quot;We are, as you say, prudent people.&quot;
His English, like that of most people in this country, is impeccable.
&quot;We don&#39;t like to show off, we don&#39;t like to show off.&quot;
Norway has managed its oil wealth very cautiously; all but a small percentage of the money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they didn&#39;t have in the years leading up to the worldwide financial crisis, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
&quot;As long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we&#39;re happy,&quot; says Anna.
&quot;And eat rakfisk,&quot; he adds with an easy laugh.
I&#39;m in the snow queuing up to eat something; I&#39;ve had enough of rakfisk.
Now an elk burger is definitely something else and quite succulent to savor.
But at night, that stinky fish comes back.
The hotel I&#39;m staying at is one of many venues that host a rakfisk dinner where diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the most nostril-taxing.
A television has connected live with a presenter wearing a bow tie and who is surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
It looks like the Eurovision contest.
&quot;What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?&quot;
&quot;Here&#39;s our score, Havard.&quot;
There is laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps overcome by the aquavit.
Or maybe it&#39;s the fumes from all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start
As Mexico&#39;s incoming President Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant discusses the challenges the new president will face and the differing expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad these days.
In a city already congested under the best of circumstances, a steel fence has been installed since Monday, cutting off several of the main roads leading into the city and causing massive chaos on the roads.
The objective, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but rather to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and assume the management of the nation.
You are faced with a difficult task.
Mexico has been doing well economically under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is submerged in a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
&quot;My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,&quot; Mr. Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.
&quot;I am going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.&quot;
Before hobnobbing with the US president, Mr. Peña&#39;s previous political experience was as governor of his home state of Mexico.
A highly populated and rapidly growing state, which surrounds the capital; Opinions on the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
Its residents credit him with the growth of tourism in the area and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive on one of Mr. Peña Nieto&#39;s new roads, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked and potholed roads that were rehabilitated.
Plaques with his name can also be seen at the entrance to a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
&quot;We are confident that he can bring about real and lasting change,&quot; says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a deputy from Mr. Peña Nieto&#39;s party, the PRI.
&quot;Particularly when it comes to security and the economy, we look forward to the exciting and real change that our country so badly needs.&quot;
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, within the party there are high expectations regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the qualification that the opposition makes of the new president&#39;s lack of essence.
&quot;He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He&#39;s a fantastic statesman and, above all, he&#39;s a good listener.&quot;
On the other side of the state, however, that&#39;s not the impression many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Tucked under elevated stretches of highway it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the intervention of the military was requested to help in the fight against the drug gangs that operate in the neighborhoods and the violence against women is especially serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than Ciudad Juárez, infamous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Critics of Mr. Peña Nieto say, at best, that he failed to address the issue of femicide while in office.
The most critical accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to fight back tears as she shows me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
&quot;When I got to his house, it looked as if his body had been cleaned,&quot; recalls Mrs. Buendía.
&quot;There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already set in.&quot;
While her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana watches from the walls, next to a cross with a single word on it: Justice.
Yet that is exactly what the family says they have been denied.
&quot;The state authorities have treated me as if I were an old gossip, a troublemaker, a complainer.
What they want is for you to just accept what they say and shut up.&quot;
&quot;But that can&#39;t be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence,&quot; he says.
The presidential sash that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will come with enormous responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years, and the new president has promised to make them a priority during his tenure.
&quot;I hope he is the same type of president that he was when he was governor,&quot; says PRI deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning Did Not Report Abuse, Prosecutors Say
Prosecutors try to deal with allegations of abuse of Bradley Manning while in prison
The trial centers on Manning&#39;s time in the Quantico military prison in Virginia.
Defense wants case dismissed on grounds Manning&#39;s imprisonment was severe
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors sought to show Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of confidential information in United States history, missed multiple opportunities to speak out for the mistreatment he now alleges he suffered while in military detention.
During the prosecution&#39;s cross-examination of Manning at a pretrial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, District Attorney Commandant Ashden Fein asserted that records of weekly visits by unit officers Manning received during nine months of detention at Quantico , Virginia, show no complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination, which took place during a hearing following a defense motion to dismiss the case because his imprisonment had been harsh and punishable enough, came a day after Manning had testified that he had thought about committing suicide while in custody.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
WikiLeaks later published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
At Friday&#39;s hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms officers filled out after visits to Manning during his arrest at Quantico Military Prison, where he was held on maximum confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have asked Manning questions and noted his responses.
When Fein inquired about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had described the treatment he received from orderlies as &quot;excellent&quot; and the treatment received at the facility in general as &quot;very professional.&quot;
The forms do not show any allegations of mistreatment, even though the officers questioned Manning directly about his treatment, Fein said.
Manning responded that he had expressed concerns about some issues and that visiting officers had discussed those issues and indicated that they would be addressed, but they did not record those issues on the record.
&quot;They would write &#39;no issues&#39; (after discussing the issues) but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean I didn&#39;t mention any issues,&quot; Manning said.
The judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not denounced his treatment during a January 2011 meeting with a board charged with examining the suicide intentions he had expressed on a form months earlier. .
Manning responded that his intention during that meeting was to obtain a reduction in the &quot;injury prevention&quot; regimen he was under.
The military said they had placed him under the restrictive regimen, which is one level below suicide watch, to ensure his protection and the safety of others.
&quot;I wanted the staff to know that I was okay and (wanted) to get out of injury prevention ... so I could enjoy what, in my view, is a better quality of life,&quot; Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered committing suicide in Kuwait and on one occasion lost consciousness due to the heat.
He said that not being allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
&quot;My world just came down to Camp Arafjon, to that cage,&quot; Manning explained Thursday.
&quot;I thought I was going to die in that cage.&quot;
Manning claimed that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most days in a small cell, for at least 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said that he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he tried to move all the time, since it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed that he always had a light from outside shining into his eyes while he slept.
He said that if the guards couldn&#39;t see his face when he turned over at night, they would wake him up so he could roll over again.
Manning&#39;s attorney filed a formal complaint about Manning&#39;s treatment in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to the Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge questioned Manning about an allegation he made in Thursday&#39;s deposition that after being forced to sleep naked in his Quantico cell one night, he was forced during a morning count to stand naked in front of of the guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During cross-examination by the judge on Friday, Manning said he deduced from the orderly order that he was to drop the blanket with which he could have covered himself, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before in an attempt to show an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning claimed that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his flip-flops to harm himself but had not done so.
Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops, and glasses had been removed from his cell that night.
His lawyers are hopeful that the judge will at least take into account the experiences he went through while in prison and drastically reduce his sentence should he be convicted at court martial, which is scheduled to start early this year. the next year.
The defense said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to misdemeanor charges and defend other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held under the rules that apply to all detainees in maximum custody at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegally causing the publication of information on the Internet, leaking of national defense information and theft of property or public records.
If convicted on all counts, he could face life in prison.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He claims that many were forced to leave Mexico due to a lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; says they remind mexicans of those hard times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had barely walked down the esplanade and reached the immigration processing area and I was already totally confused.
Signs pointed the way to two lines: one for &quot;Mexicans&quot; and one for &quot;Foreigners.&quot;
I stood there for a few seconds not sure where I should go.
Growing up in Central California, I have been called &quot;Mexican&quot; all my life.
This is ethnic shorthand, the way my friends in Boston refer to themselves as &quot;Irish&quot; or my friends in New York call themselves &quot;Italian.&quot;
Later I settled on &quot;Mexican-American.&quot;
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather&#39;s homeland, shorthand or hyphens were not necessary.
He was simply American.
I speak Spanish. Well enough to handle me during an interview in this language.
But I don&#39;t have the vocabulary level of a native and I can&#39;t get rid of my American accent.
So I took my US passport and got in line for foreigners.
I thought about that moment this week when Mexican President-elect Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda for the day, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, included: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why a Mexican is just as likely to stay in Mexico right now as he is to venture to the United States.
It wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trading bloc in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of rancor.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not minutes, the elements that remind them of this are everywhere.
So the minute a US official says anything that carries the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start hearing complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how the Americans are usurping sovereignty. from their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma are on the warpath.
And yet, for Mexico, the really challenging relationship is with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about resentment?
There&#39;s a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is that somewhere along our family tree, there was a person, maybe the father or the mother or one of the grandparents, to whom the door of opportunities in Mexico was closed and they had to go north.
And most of the time that person fit a certain profile: dark skin, a low educational level, coming from a poor town, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And, despite the fact that we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and having had good jobs, we can never lose sight of the fact that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican one.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It is for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us as if we&#39;re an underclass that isn&#39;t Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn&#39;t failed in Mexico, they wouldn&#39;t have left.
And now we wouldn&#39;t find ourselves trapped behind this silken curtain, living well in America but still lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally when she was a child, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more solidly who they are and the latter resent it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she considers herself part of both countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel like they are not a part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you are not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexican.
Now, to further complicate matters, from what I have learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to serve as impromptu &quot;ambassadors&quot; for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how great it is to visit that country and press political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes of course...
That&#39;s not gonna happen.
There is too much rancor.
And, with unequal wages, rampant corruption, and drug violence, many of us aren&#39;t so sure it&#39;s a great country.
I am afraid that you are going to be left alone with this idea, friends.
It&#39;s fair.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way it treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to come to terms with the fact that some Mexican-Americans still resent how their relatives were treated. much less time ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we are more &quot;Mexican&quot; than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
Ceasefire between Israel and Hamas may well be an unlikely basis for peace
Could there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
Amid the usual futile arguments over who started first, scores of buildings have been reduced to rubble; More than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, Israel&#39;s metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But despite the fact that the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring has left everything in pieces whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught up in the regional uproar.
Perhaps this will make their fight even bloodier than before.
However, there are reasons to think that their deadly stalemate could be unraveled.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism currently seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 holds, this week&#39;s fighting has reinforced the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has taken a good beating.
And despite having killed some of its leaders and squeezed Gaza&#39;s 1.7 million people into one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to finish off Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its implacable rivals in Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Furthermore, Hamas leaders may conclude that time is on their side.
As the Islamists have gained influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that had previously been Israel&#39;s closest Muslim ally, has embraced the cause of Hamas. So has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Jubilant Hamas members say the Islamist crescent is encircling Israel, from northern Lebanon, where the Hezbollah militia party dominates, through Syria, where increasingly Islamist-leaning rebels could topple Bashar Assad, to reach Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially on Israel&#39;s southern flank, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, didn&#39;t have much time for Hamas.
In contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood is Hamas&#39; first cousin and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic moves, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, including Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel&#39;s hardliners will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in its place.
Israel&#39;s Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven its worth and many of Hamas&#39;s missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep easier... for a while.
As for diplomacy, the United States is more assertive than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for starting the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel hasn&#39;t had too many suicide bombers, thanks in part to the barrier gnawing at the West Bank, the main chunk of Palestinian aspiring territory. and protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite being illegal under international law.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even harder-line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, is in a good position.
Why coddle those twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn&#39;t they fire rockets just like their compatriots have done in Gaza?
It&#39;s better to have them behind that wall and give them a good whack if they raise their heads.
The hard-liners may prevail, although the Arab Spring could upset their calculations.
Even if the Islamists who seize power in Egypt and elsewhere may not have much regard for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel&#39;s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the regional superpower is hardly going to help the new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire bodes well and could mark the start of something.
Israelis should also think long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a tinderbox that will one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics make matters worse as the Arab population grows.
The bloody missions into Gaza every two or three years to repel Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the one hawked by sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and Israel&#39;s ceding of territory for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more momentum to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must start curbing the flow of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, finds itself in an unprecedented position to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs unrelated to the issue should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to come together.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain virtual statehood at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term he omitted to present his own plan for peace.
Back in the White House, he seems just as reluctant to give her any attention.
This attitude supposes a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is in the vital interest of the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
Plain tobacco packaging law comes into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and diseased body parts appear on dull green packs, which are the same for all brands of tobacco
Australia&#39;s world-first Tobacco and Plain Packaging Act takes effect, replacing brand logos and colors with dull olive-green packaging, gruesome images of diseased body parts and depictions of children and babies sick from being children of smoking parents.
Except for the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the packs, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small typeface.
This is the strictest regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
Australia&#39;s federal government says the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by removing the traits that make smoking glamorous.
He relies on studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they never will.
&quot;You can see that children, even from a very young age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their brand,&quot; said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies showing, for example, how girls associated the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect multinationals&#39; profits much, other countries are considering similar steps.
The tobacco industry has lobbied enormously against the law.
Tobacco companies claimed the law would encourage the black tobacco market, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
&quot;The legislation will have serious unintended consequences,&quot; said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
The amount of tobacco that counterfeiters will bring in from China and Indonesia to sell on the streets of Australia will increase.
Others say their business has benefited from the passing of the law.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said demand for cigarette cases and silicone covers to hide the unsightly images on the packs had shot up almost from zero two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain&#39;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the High Court of Australia.
Ms. Ha stated that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale outlets and was waiting for more stock.
&quot;For us it&#39;s good business.&quot;
The potential hurdle, experts say, is the popularity of social media among the plan&#39;s targeted demographic.
Following a series of Australian laws banning television advertising and sports sponsorship and forcing most sellers not to display cigarettes, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising for local businesses and websites, but cannot restrict advertising on foreign websites.
&quot;If you&#39;re trading tobacco and only have this little window left to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place to be,&quot; said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in brand reviews from &quot;ordinary citizens&quot; posted on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One wonders if he is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigars and has taken the trouble to make a video or if some marketing company is behind it all.
Australia&#39;s British American Tobacco said the industry is focusing more on what the new regulations entail than on marketing.
The industry has even gone so far as to pay for the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of these countries have significant trade volume with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a ruling in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had been in talks with other countries considering applying similar laws on tobacco packaging.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to make it mandatory to include images on packs.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
In Australia many smokers are defiant.
&quot;Photographs don&#39;t affect me.
I just ignore them.&quot;
&quot;You take the cigarette and keep the package,&quot; says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
&quot;Honestly, there&#39;s only one reason I&#39;d quit smoking: for my daughter.&quot;
James Yu, manager of King of the Pack tobacconist in central Sydney, says that uniform packs make it more difficult for him to get them on the shelves.
&quot;It used to take an hour to unwrap a delivery; now it takes four,&quot; says Yu.
&quot;The government should have completely banned tobacco and then, that&#39;s it, okay, it&#39;s over and we closed the shop,&quot; he says, raising his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it&#39;s not so bad to get a little bored
During the Thanksgiving holiday this year, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying had a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I&#39;m not going to lie to you.
Spending half a day in an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have the means to keep yourself entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, not to mention duty-free shops.
But more and more academics and child development experts are praising the benefits of boredom.
According to them, it is okay for us and our children to get bored from time to time.
Being bored forces the brain to search for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we don&#39;t experience the benefits of boredom.
So should we take boredom in good spirits?
Yeah.
And not.
But, we&#39;ll talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that now that we have more leisure time, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as stated by Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary, in Canada, and author of the book &quot;Boredom: A Lively History&quot; (&quot;Boredom, a lively history&quot;) published in 2011 by Yale University Press, it is not.
&quot;In fact, the history of boredom is very long,&quot; he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin about boredom dating from the first century AD
We must also ask ourselves how we define boredom.
&quot;The problem is that it&#39;s already been defined and discussed in so many different ways,&quot; says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing published research and putting the idea before a focus group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and colleagues defined boredom as the experience of &quot;wanting, but not being able to, engage in a fulfilling activity.&quot;
He affirms that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do something.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is &quot;alteration of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a sensation that time passes slowly.&quot;
Boredom can sound awfully similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as an environmental or world issue, while people who are depressed see the problem as their own.
Sometimes we think we&#39;re bored, when what&#39;s really happening to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In their study &quot;The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention&quot;, published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups listened to an unrelated TV show at full volume in the next room, others listened to it turned down so it was barely audible, while the third group heard no audio at all.
The group that listened to the program with the volume turned down showed more boredom than the other two groups; they had a hard time concentrating, but they weren&#39;t sure why and put it down to boredom.
&quot;When you&#39;re trying to focus on a difficult or interesting task, impaired attention can lead to boredom,&quot; said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph, in Ontario, and one of the study&#39;s authors.
&quot;On the other hand, when you&#39;re doing something boring, like spotting defective parts on a manufacturing line, distracting music can help keep you from getting bored.&quot;
&quot;In fact, we now know that moving around or scribbling, actions that are often interpreted as signs of boredom, can actually help combat boredom by making the person more physically alert.&quot;
&quot;Research shows that children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay still,&quot; says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it&#39;s like to get bored at some point: a plane delay, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more prone to boredom than others.
To help measure boredom, some researchers developed a &quot;boredom proneness scale&quot; in the 1980s.
The scale includes questions like &quot;a lot of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous&quot; and &quot;there are so many things that interest me that I don&#39;t have time to do everything.&quot;
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that using these scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely than girls to be bored more often, and specifically need more and more varied external stimulation.
But in general, teenagers are a type of group that get bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of Human and Community Development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day using a pager.
It found that 32 percent of teens said they got bored while at school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they got bored when they weren&#39;t at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if the current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what he did know was that &quot;adolescence is a period when boredom reaches its heights,&quot; in large part because both children and adolescents are not given much control over what they do. what do you want to do.
So, going back to my question at the beginning: is it good to be bored?
Sometimes it is not, since, taken to the extreme, it can expose us to absurd physical risks, such as gambling or indulging in substance use as a method of combating it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this question for more than two decades.
&quot;Boredom is the brain&#39;s way of telling you that you should be doing something else,&quot; says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn&#39;t always know what is most appropriate.
If you are bored and you use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
&quot;So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he won&#39;t have learned to entertain himself or to dose himself,&quot; says Professor Fenske.
And &quot;this ability to dose is applied to other situations,&quot; he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, but also learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don&#39;t think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn&#39;t be too critical of him either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant buzz of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
&quot;The way we see it, we need to be bored more, but boredom is too distressing and disturbing a desire to be associated with anything worthwhile,&quot; he says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to unwind and enjoy some down time.
&quot;In an environment where we&#39;re constantly overstimulated,&quot; he says, &quot;it&#39;s hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops.&quot;
Colorado: No Instruction Book for New Marijuana Law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old community college student and soccer player from southeastern Colorado, is facing criminal prosecution for something that will soon be legal statewide: possession of some marijuana rocks and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when they were pulled over by police.
Police found marijuana in the car, and some time later Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and related items (misdemeanors that each carry a US$100 fine) informing him of the trial date.
&quot;They treat us like criminals,&quot; says Orozco.
And are they?
In the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado&#39;s vote to legalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of petty drug possession cases depends less on law than on location.
Hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana possession offenses are being struck down both here and in Washington state, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped filing charges against those over 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally approved once the law goes into effect in the coming weeks.
But Colorado&#39;s most conservative district attorneys have vowed to press forward with open marijuana possession cases and are still subpoenaing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the Denver suburbs to the western mountains, are voting to block newly licensed marijuana shops from opening in their communities.
&quot;This is all changing so quickly that I don&#39;t know what&#39;s next,&quot; said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Regulators in Washington state are also thinking about it.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sale licences; all this before the deadline arrives, December 1, 2013.
They say that, for better or worse, Colorado is ahead of most states when it comes to regulating the use of marijuana, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
&quot;Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,&quot; says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
&quot;There is no real precedent to serve as a model for us,&quot; he says.
The Washington law, called I-502, goes into effect on December 6, which also leaves a year in which to swim between two waters, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that need to be worked out during that period, such as how to balance between the state&#39;s requirement to provide &quot;adequate access&quot; to licensed marijuana and its ban on conducting cannabis business within a radius of less than 300 meters from schools, parks, children&#39;s play areas or children&#39;s centers.
&quot;Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially the greater Seattle area,&quot; says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly created research group.
On November 21, Oates, the Aurora police chief, sent an email to his police officers informing them that the city attorney would no longer prosecute misdemeanor marijuana possession offenses against seniors. 21-year-old and that the police would stop pressing charges against those crimes &quot;with immediate effect&quot;.
Police Chief Oates said they would be responsible for enforcing city regulations governing the cultivation of marijuana for medical purposes and would continue to pursue drug dealers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck takes a stricter view.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to pressure consumers into deciding to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people are facing charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, though many of them have other charges.
&quot;Our office has an obligation to prosecute offenses that were criminal offenses at the time they occurred,&quot; Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana legalization initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county&#39;s largest city, no longer cite adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending possession cases.
&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m wasting my time by continuing to enforce the law until the law changes,&quot; he said.
Despite 55 percent of voters supporting the measure, bringing recreational marijuana use into the government and judicial system was never considered easy.
The conflicting reactions emerging across the state reveal a marked ambivalence among officials about the great environmental experiment in this state.
&quot;It&#39;s a cultural barrier with district attorneys,&quot; says Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney who represents marijuana possession defendants and is a local spokesperson for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
&quot;They&#39;ve spent so much time taking people to court that they still can&#39;t really accept that it&#39;s legal,&quot; he said.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana the same as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are poised to become the national test cases for drug legalization.
As lawyers and state officials count on a new frontier for legal sales, they are also eagerly awaiting directions from the federal government, which still makes the sale and cultivation of marijuana federal crimes.
Marijuana legalization advocates are hoping the Justice Department will relent.
Despite some high-profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and sellers, the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana businesses to exist in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
&quot;While drug enforcement officers are not likely to break down doors to seize a small bag of drugs, they are likely to be reluctant to allow state-regulated stores to sell recreational marijuana allowed under the new law.&quot; said Kevin A. Sabet, a former Obama administration drug policy adviser.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before Election Day, some local governments passed moratoriums on any new pot shops, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to approve it next week.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level,&quot; said Bob Nicholson, a member of the council.
&quot;Our community voted against this amendment.
We are looking at what the community voted for versus voting for what the state voted for.&quot;
Many questions arise about it.
Petronella Wyatt: &quot;I was harassed until I was kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory&quot;
University students are not attacked for their views only now
I can&#39;t remember a time in my life when I wasn&#39;t dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a contemporary-era Greek symposium that promoted the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study History, I had already packed my bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and began to cry.
My friends were puzzled.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had dropped out because I did not tolerate some college mates having sex in the next room.
The writer AN Wilson jokingly announced that I had left because I was forced to drink out of chipped cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran from there.
Yes, I ran away, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my fancy name, or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason only, which in the cradle of the so-called enlightenment was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a leading adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative Party.
You might be wondering what&#39;s up with that now.
Well, various reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is suffering similar persecution.
Institutionalized and growing hatred of Conservative Party students is such at Oxford that last week a group of them demanded the same level of equal rights as gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College&#39;s JCR (undergraduate student union) say they are &quot;often severely ostracized, personally attacked and treated as persona non grata&quot; for their political views.
They want to create a seat on their college&#39;s equal opportunity committee to make sure they can express their opinions freely.
Their situation was not helped by a recent BBC2 documentary called &quot;Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right&quot; (Paradise: young, bright and right-wing) on student politics and portraying Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former chairman of the Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and carrying a silver-handled cane.
At other universities, conservative students say they are being treated as &quot;scapegoats&quot; for the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, vice-chairman of the Nottingham University Conservative Party Association, told a Sunday paper that &quot;there is a growing left-wing trend in universities.
People assume we&#39;re like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other.&quot;
Samuel Roberts, 21, a Corpus Christi history student who filed the motion for greater protection, says the environment is &quot;uncomfortable,&quot; while Stephanie Cherill, 19, OUCA president-elect, says the attitude of the members of the JCR towards people who are of the center right has worsened.
&quot;This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of the members,&quot; he says.
During my first weeks at Oxford I was lonelier than one.
I entered university in September 1986, a terribly shy 18-year-old.
Hatred for the Conservative Party was at an all time high.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny former student Margaret Thatcher an honorary degree following cuts in Higher Education funding.
The atmosphere would have made any Stalinist shudder with horror.
Already during the first days of the week of welcoming the new university students, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that awaited me.
I found that the professors not only turned a blind eye to the mockery that was made of conservative university students, they participated in it willingly.
The politics of the miners&#39; strike, privatization and government opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa spilled over into the wooden halls of the seminary.
The first one I attended was to translate 18th century French texts into English and I was not prepared for what came next.
&quot;Miss Wyatt,&quot; said Professor Harry Pitt (since deceased), &quot;please translate the first paragraph.&quot;
I didn&#39;t say one.
Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like cake batter, knew how to expel bad bile.
&quot;Are the Thatcherites refusing to learn French or are they just stupid?&quot; he asked.
The other college kids laughed.
My eyes burned from the tears I was trying to hold back.
&quot;I suggest you take French classes in your spare time, as long as you&#39;re not too busy meeting people,&quot; Pitt growled.
I went back to my room like a lost soul.
That night I sat alone at dinner at the university; then I felt a light pat on the back.
He was a sophomore English student named James who applied for membership in OUCA.
&quot;I know who you are,&quot; he told me kindly.
&quot;I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s how it goes.
They pick on anyone suspected of being a Tory.
It&#39;s very difficult for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it will be even worse.
Many newcomer Tories pretend to be Labour.&quot;
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to hide it.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher was saying.
That trick was useless.
A first-year Philosophy, Politics and Economics student who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: &quot;You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You&#39;re tainted.&quot;
Other students picked up that ditty.
I became the dirty pervert.
&quot;How do Tories have sex?&quot; asked one.
&quot;They beat each other up, don&#39;t they?&quot;
I felt the same way homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could he one day lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I join Labor and curb my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me seemed like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History posted to my college.
They hated him for being not only from the Conservative party, but also an adviser to Thatcher on foreign policy and one of the people who wrote her speeches.
I was barely there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because of his adherence to the Marxist-determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
&quot;You&#39;re not going to be happy here,&quot; he told me.
I began commuting daily from Oxford to my parents&#39; home in London, finding refuge with my more open-minded metropolitan family and friends.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why.
He did not believe me.
When he was studying there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
&quot;But it&#39;s the best place in the world,&quot; he said sadly.
&quot;They would never do that, not there among my dear dreaming needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude.&quot;
His pained eyes began to cloud over.
&quot;Give him another chance.
I&#39;m sure they did it just for fun.
It would break my heart if you let him.&quot;
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional stamina was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to the pressure and renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar where another history professor had insinuated, in all seriousness, that I was an &quot;enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do the same.
Red with shame on the inside, I admitted that I had been &quot;brainwashed&quot; by my parents and called them &quot;stupid old men.&quot;
The truce lasted a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my university career at Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two weekly columns for Murdoch&#39;s press.
My door was locked.
I was inside cowering in fear, and after five minutes my pursuers gave up.
When they left I packed my suitcase and caught the next train to London.
I never went back.
You may call me a weak crybaby.
But no 18 year old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only trained 14 Conservative Prime Ministers but, to this day, hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
&quot;Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety&quot;
On the occasion of the &quot;Valentino: Master of Sewing&quot; exhibition, which opened this week in London, ABC spoke with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized this during the inauguration of &quot;Valentino: Master of Couture&quot;, a tremendous retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his &quot;maison&quot; over the last 50 years.
&quot;I adore this palace,&quot; he says in his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is &quot;il signore&quot; Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, there are plenty of private letters and photos signed by the best of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal de Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a humble couturier from the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to an idol of the international &quot;jet-set&quot;.
There is nothing wrong with being in love with royalty.
&quot;At least they don&#39;t put out their cigarette butts on your magnificent carpet like some beautiful pop music celebrities do,&quot; says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
&quot;We all loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad,&quot; explains the ex-wife of &quot;Heini&quot; Thyssen, close to forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli and Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And still, he&#39;s a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the couturier.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the apartment, the decoration, the food, the music, his spirit was seen and felt in everything.
&quot;He made each of the guests feel important and loved,&quot; recalls the &quot;top model&quot;, who began working with him during Haute Couture Week in Paris in 1995.
&quot;It never goes out of style because his designs are works of art,&quot; he concludes.
lineage parade
Garavani&#39;s life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-requited love.
He loves people with a good education and better degrees, and they love him.
One of Somerset House&#39;s galleries has been transformed into a 200-foot-long glamorous catwalk that offers a reversal of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must walk down the catwalk to behold a dreamy &quot;audience&quot; She wears Valentino masterpieces, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the wardrobe used by Monica Vitti in &quot;La Notte&quot;, or a wool and fur coat that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of mannequins, names such as Sibilla from Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofía from Habsburg shine.
Naty Abascal and the designer, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, &quot;impossible to forget&quot;.
I remember perfectly.
It was trousers, a shirt, a &quot;gillette&quot; vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
&quot;It was a gift he gave me,&quot; says Naty Abascal, one of the designer&#39;s muses.
&quot;I prefer him over others because of his femininity, because of his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty,&quot; adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors you use, they have great light and are &quot;donors&quot; to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Giovampaola d&#39;Arenberg can&#39;t forget the first time she wore a Valentino either.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of reaching the age and the occasion to be able to wear one of their evening gowns...
The time finally came in the late 90s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear to a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with a ruffled skirt, draped corsage, and strapless neckline.
&quot;It was a dream come true,&quot; says Rodrigo d&#39;Arenberg&#39;s widow.
&quot;Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless,&quot; explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D&#39;Arenberg guards her party dresses from the couturier with &quot;the greatest care... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also the set of memories that it entails.&quot;
The &quot;king&quot; of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller&#39;s wedding dress at her wedding to Pablo of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 &quot;ragazze&quot; (as the couturier calls his seamstresses) to create this ivory silk costume inlaid with pearls, twelve different types of lace and a fifteen-foot train.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority in the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone in haute couture at the end of the 20th century, &quot;the return of high society clients&quot;.
For years obsessed with the &quot;savoir-être&quot; of the elite, Valentino is now his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Italy&#39;s highest-ranking distinction), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L&#39;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of his clients&#39; husbands.
&quot;I have always been struck by his refinement, his calm, his neat and perfect appearance,&quot; admits D&#39;Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d&#39;Orsay.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
&quot;He was impeccable, time does not pass for him.&quot;
If a princess says it...
The hardest job in the world: Kawah Ijen&#39;s human mules
For four euros, the porters of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to go down every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulfurous gas that emanates from the bowels of the Earth solidifies when it comes into contact with the air.
After uprooting large sulfur boulders, which together weigh about 70 kilos, he carries them in two bamboo baskets that he carries on his shoulders through steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters, but it takes more than 40 minutes for the exhausted porters to ascend at a snail&#39;s pace, keeping their balance and carefully timing their steps so as not to slip and fall off the ground. the precipice.
They know that any misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell off the cliffs of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulfur they extract
Once at the top, they make their way through the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, laboriously carrying the heavy baskets, they walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has placed a little below, at 1,850 meters above sea level.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupiahs (5 euro cents) for each kilo of sulfur.
He then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
&quot;Since the normal thing is to carry 70 kilos, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip,&quot; explains Anto, who usually makes three daily shipments.
It takes three hours for each one and he ends up exhausted, but they allow him to collect 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems like a pittance for such an inhuman effort, it is triple what he would earn on the field.
&quot;The miners&#39; wages are very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),&quot; the porter clarifies. who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the cut was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a compelling reason that, in Indonesia, is as blunt as brimstone: &quot;I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought her to Java to convert to Islam.&quot;
Anto has asthma, he is breathing hard, coughing constantly, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases
At 27, Anto has been risking his skin at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulfur has already begun to take its toll on him despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, is breathing hard, coughs constantly, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases emitted by the volcano.
It is the price you must pay to achieve your dream.
&quot;I will work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,&quot; he promises in more than passable English.
Grounded by life, this likeable and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead he works as a mule.
Sharing a filthy wooden cabin with other porters, he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not stop flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the dark.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends into the crater lighting up with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
Some 400 porters carry the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its huge profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur to save costs, nor does it supply any equipment to the porters, who work on their own and both by weight.
In fact, they don&#39;t even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera that, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the rangers of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
&quot;This job is for beasts and not for people,&quot; protests Madrusin, a stocky 42-year-old porter who has been on the Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left school.
Able to lift up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will endure working &quot;as long as he can&quot; because he needs the money to educate his three children, between the ages of 18 and 10.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and stings the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so tough that no one complains of serious illness... beyond, of course, of his usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pain in his knees and sores on his shoulders, which have become malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can only carry 50 kilos at 53 years old.
Every day, he and his colleagues extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away, along a goat track through the undergrowth.
&quot;I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life,&quot; Unainik proclaims, opening his mouth wide, where several teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30, also works loading sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest trades in the world: the one performed by the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
&quot;Singapore&#39;s population needs to grow.&quot;
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, let&#39;s do our civic duty and create life!
It may seem implausible that these verses are part of an ad for mints, but despite - or perhaps because of - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lines are part of a rap that uses local references like &quot;Let&#39;s put a bao (bun) in the oven&quot; to make fun of Singapore&#39;s birthrate.
The ad company that made the video, BBH, is hoping that the ad will bring attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to help people do &quot;their national duty.&quot;
This is pure internet stuff so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world at reproducing ourselves so we felt this was an issue we needed to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, like launching pheromone perfumes or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn&#39;t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don&#39;t we get as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is writing a rap?
1.2 children
The one that does not take it so lightly is the Singapore government.
He spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and doles out tax breaks.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore&#39;s birth rate, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 - known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why aren&#39;t Singaporeans having more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Division, says it&#39;s because of &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;a wider range of career opportunities.&quot;
&quot;That has given people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family,&quot; he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in singleness, and delayed marriage and births, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy that aims to drastically increase immigration to cope with population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where thinly disguised xenophobia abounds against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, whom they criticize for keeping wages low and not integrating.
Rising immigration is also seen as one of the reasons Singapore&#39;s ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher fees and levies for foreign workers.
unexpected consequences
While falling birth rates have known effects on a nation&#39;s economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs, and immigration policies, the Singapore example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government tries not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has come to control the number of small apartments, known as &quot;shoeboxes&quot;, that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have been very successful sellers.
However, there is concern that they may promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers from building large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate company EL Developers, says his &quot;shoeboxes&quot; sell much faster than the larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units sell out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new rules provide clearer guidance for developers, who previously were hampered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
too stressed
Singapore is a city state.
While these new rules may be a step toward increasing the national birth rate, speaking to Singaporeans who work in the central business district, it sounds like they won&#39;t have much of an effect.
&quot;People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are putting it off,&quot; says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
&quot;But for me it&#39;s important to have my own money and time,&quot; says another young man in his 20s.
Men and women mention their career, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans call the shots.
What is private offline is private online
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is about the quality of private or &quot;the sphere of private life that one has the right to protect from any interference&quot;.
What is private for a child under 16?
How do you apply this definition in your everyday life and on social media?
Do you understand the dangers you are exposed to by airing situations on the Internet that you surely would not share offline?
elPeriódico interviewed five boys between the ages of ten and 15, frequent users of the Internet.
In four of the cases, they associated the term to &quot;something very mine&quot;, on a personal level, and &quot;in the password and name of the user&quot;, when they applied it to social networks.
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t upload my deepest secrets to a post,&quot; says ten-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
&quot;They are very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not everyone,&quot; he says.
On FB I upload beautiful images or games.
I also entertain myself with my acquaintances.
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t share a photo that isn&#39;t me, or someone who is making a fool of themselves,&quot; he says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to post obscene, nude, crime photos or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I turned to Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
&quot;I don&#39;t know if they answer me, I just upload them,&quot; he adds.
&quot;Social networks are entertaining, I can talk with distant relatives or with my friends quickly,&quot; he says.
He does not hesitate to answer that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
Nor would he listen to someone who recommended a stranger.
The case of José, 14 years old, is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter he admits not knowing 20 of the people added to his friends list.
&quot;It doesn&#39;t scare me, because we have something in common, music for example,&quot; he says.
According to the boy, no one has come forward to him or asked for his home address or phone number.
&quot;If they pressured me or demanded it, I would simply remove them from my account,&quot; he admits.
José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not alien to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of one of my friends was being extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
&quot;He never knew who he was,&quot; he says.
The victim, according to José, did not close the account.
&quot;He just put privacy on it.&quot;
It then explains a series of steps to set up the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would upload photos of acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would, if I don&#39;t like him or feel like it.
&quot;Although I know that this is cyberbullying,&quot; he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
&quot;The Internet emerged as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites the rules of the game changed,&quot; he mentions.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, Master of Education from Yale University and author of the book Nativos e Inmigrantes Digitales, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with technology.
&quot;We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are still learning,&quot; he says.
He comments that the subject is complex, &quot;because we are asking them to have a defined criteria on what should or should not be disseminated, published or said at an age that maturity does not allow for that.&quot;
&quot;Also that they are selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,&quot; he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach privacy to children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect.
&quot;Telling them not to do it doesn&#39;t help,&quot; he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things that you would not tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a photo of you like the one you posted of a friend?
Do you know what others post about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask other people for permission to tag them?
And one more, does everyone need to know what you are doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act online as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
&quot;One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, the same should be on social networks,&quot; he says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential that parents read the policies of social networks conscientiously.
By understanding each of the paragraphs they have a solid foundation to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
&quot;For example, the age and what is allowed to share or publish,&quot; he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson &quot;don&#39;t talk to strangers.&quot;
Unasur Summit ends without making public the Lima Declaration
The VI Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attending leaders.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources from the Foreign Ministry and the Presidency indicated at first that they were going to deliver it after the closure, but later they affirmed that in At some point it will be published on the Peruvian Government website.
When consulted about the text, they indicated that the content had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists&#39; access to Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the silent video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with the message &quot;private session, restricted audio.&quot;
The little information that circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press spokespersons of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian one.
The only document released during the day was the list of attending presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the Presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the &quot;final declaration&quot; of the summit, but it is Humala&#39;s pronouncement, and not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the III Summit of South America-Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently requested by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was not disseminated either.
On the official ASPA website it can be confirmed that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities made an effort to have secure transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited the obtaining of information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling from the Court in The Hague to settle a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (ICJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to hear the arguments of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
&quot;We will abide by and execute the ruling that defines the differences that we are taking to this international court today,&quot; Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
&quot;Chile has been, is, and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties, and international tribunals,&quot; Piñera added, shaking hands with Humala, along with to the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ occurred after Colombia denounced this week the Pact of Bogotá by which it had accepted to submit to the rulings of that international court, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered seriously erroneous. .
The summit was held with the absences of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he informed that 16 agreements were adopted and lines of action were established for 31 projects between South American countries for a total of 17 billion dollars in investments.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take &quot;important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for which we are expanding the agreements on residence.&quot;
He reported that actions are being promoted to improve &quot;cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and against transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, low-priced internet access in all corners of South America, and provide jointly and efficiently the risks of natural disasters&quot;.
With a Europe in crisis, &quot;the economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphal matrix, but should serve to expand our productive matrix and envision a better future for our peoples,&quot; added Humala.
&quot;We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of spaces in South America, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,&quot; said the Peruvian president in a message read.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give further details.
Likewise, the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
&quot;We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for his reincorporation into the Union of South American Nations,&quot; from which he is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and of good relations between neighbors, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before beginning his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to respectfully discuss the maritime dispute after a ruling of the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
&quot;Tomorrow (Saturday) I may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,&quot; Santos said.
&quot;We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, including the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua,&quot; he stressed.
&quot;With President Ortega I hope to be able to tell him that we handle this in the most civil and respectful way possible,&quot; Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Likewise, as part of the summit, the bloc&#39;s defense ministers previously met to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defense matters in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
&quot;South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship&quot;: Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, affirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which &quot;South America, in this case, must learn from Europe.&quot;
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told the state TV Peru that Europeans &quot;killed each other in World War II&quot; and in other conflicts, &quot;but now they are practically a homeland&quot;.
In this sense, he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
&quot;It is necessary to achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers through any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past,&quot; he warned.
The Ecuadorian president was also in favor of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José pact on rights humans.
Those who teach never commit to anything and, on the other hand, we South Americans sign everything.
&quot;It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States,&quot; he said, referring to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he is not sorry for that decision because with it he has not betrayed his principles, but rather has respected his &quot;deep democratic and human rights values.&quot;
He added that, at the time, &quot;there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and his process was not respected.&quot;
He also criticized the Swedish justice for demanding that he submit to interrogation in his territory for an alleged sexual offense when &quot;Swedish legislation itself allows it to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.&quot;
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange&#39;s physical and mental health will deteriorate.
&quot;I have not spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious,&quot; said the Ecuadorian president.
What there is is the danger that their physical and mental health will deteriorate due to being locked up in a small space without being able to exercise outdoors.
&quot;That complicates the health of any person,&quot; he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a safe passage that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been permanent conversations.
&quot;The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange&#39;s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is carrying out a series of procedures in different European instances,&quot; he mentioned.
And he opined that &quot;if Great Britain gives the safe-conduct tomorrow this is over.&quot;
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly allows and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow, this problem will end.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and qualified that what he does not tolerate is &quot;mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which undermine freedom of expression.&quot;
&quot;The biggest enemies of press freedom are not evil and perverse politicians but bad journalists for profit, blackmail and extortion,&quot; he said.
In this regard, he was pleased that these journalists are no longer &quot;neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador,&quot; and announced that if he is re-elected &quot;he will deepen the revolution to continue on the right path and direction.&quot;
Correa also supported the decision to maintain Paraguay&#39;s veto in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the organization &quot;must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and legal coup&quot; because in reality &quot;it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy.
The Ecuadorian president also considered &quot;perfectly pertinent&quot; the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this ruling is not followed.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
You have to process them extensively to overcome them and move on.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the litigation for maritime limits that Peru and Chile maintain in the same court and opined that &quot;it is correct for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries agree to accept a ruling no matter how harsh it may be.&quot;
Referring to the eventuality that he will run as a candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he sees this possibility &quot;with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard.&quot;
Correa assured that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as Ecuador&#39;s, socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected through political power.
&quot;My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed that probable victory, because we have to accept that responsibility,&quot; he said.
If I win, it would be my last term in the presidency and from there we left public life.
If we lose the same
&quot;It&#39;s a decision,&quot; he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he traveled for a treatment that was already planned, routine, that he was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
&quot;It does not mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez,&quot; he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are a cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the test result was confirmed: AIDS positive.
&quot;It was as if a bomb fell on me,&quot; he says, recalling the moment of the announcement, which the doctor tried to make &quot;softer,&quot; without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to find out about it; with such determination that he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is, without a doubt, one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there was much doubt, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him &quot;because he had a cut.&quot;
So, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, unaware of their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, &quot;depleted&quot; their immune systems and are victims of opportunistic infections.
Thirty-one years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least from the first reported cases, &quot;the great achievement means at this moment that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same&quot;, indicated the head of the HCG HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after stating that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of affectation to the immune system that they present patients at the beginning of the diagnosis, with a better expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a CD4 count of 200 and 50 years, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, this means that whoever receives a positive HIV diagnosis at 25 years of age, under these terms &quot;as long as he maintains control, he will be able to live without problems until he is 75 years old,&quot; explained the interviewee.
To measure this advance, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
Although mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS dropped from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the appearance of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there have been 187 deaths up to May of this year; However, it is ensured that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
Why are there still deaths?
- It seems to me that the problem is not one of access to treatment.
This is how I visualize it, this is how it has happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had a shortage of medication. The problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they are unaware of their infection status, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He gave a conclusive fact: &quot;Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what must be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality, is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, tests must be offered detection in a massive way, to all the people who require it&quot;.
In his proposal, specialists and officials from the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida) agree, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to a private laboratory to be tested, only motivated because a friend had done it and, despite at his young age, he was already in the stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi&#39;s sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they are going to die and do not want to know anything.
&quot;If I&#39;m going to die, I&#39;d better burst three times a week&quot;, they say not in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, I exercise, I take the medicines.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone.
&quot;I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active but co-responsible sexual life, I take care of myself and the other person&quot;, listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share his privacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, in the World AIDS Day, they are afraid.
That they get tested, if they were at risk, that the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, the better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live like anyone else, being responsible.
That, his message, sums up the motto of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
condoms behind the counter
There are big gaps between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken up the cause around HIV.
And the biggest is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task &quot;the distribution of condoms has indeed increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of a hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that there are those who today still do not have access to a condom,&quot; he said.
Among those most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
&quot;What do you want them for?&quot; It is a common question, with sarcasm and value judgments from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which adolescents do not want to be exposed, the communicator assured.
He proposed to reorient this ineffective distribution; that condoms are not only behind the counters and that those hundred are found in public restroom dispensers in places frequented by young people.
It is not to motivate promiscuity.
It is not even about paying for the drinks and the motel, as Governor Emilio González responded, when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms in his Administration.
&quot;This is not sexuality, it is best to bring condoms to those who already practice sexual activity,&quot; he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 accumulated cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state is 4th nationally in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV.
92% of the infections correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV, since for a registered case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know it.
Ratified by a court of appeals in the United States a sentence that ignores the restructuring of the debt of Grupo Vitro achieved through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, the scenario sets a disastrous precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighboring country that has solvency problems .
It would seem, then, that the procedures to guarantee the survival of the firms that Mexican laws allow are not valid in the country of the stars and stripes, contrary to international agreements.
On a practical level, the endorsement of the sentence issued on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, leaves Mexican firms defenseless against the possibility of seizure of their properties in Allende. The brave.
However, the resolution opens the door for the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the Supreme Court of the United States, alleging three inconsistencies.
From the outset, while the judge in the case points out that creditors must abide by the Bankruptcy Law of the United States, the court of appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is the commercial bankruptcy processed in Mexico.
The first point would imply ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, towards this end the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Trade Law was created, placing the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the sentence establishes that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial bankruptcy the debts that the subsidiaries of Vitro had with their parent company, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro&#39;s has not been the first case in which the scheme has been accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Insolvency.
What is also true is that subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, in any case Vitro&#39;s creditors who fought against it in the United States Courts, that is, the &quot;vulture&quot; funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, they will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent to 37.
The data is omitted by the Court of Appeals.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced starting in 2008, oblivious to the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, which hit the country hard.
For now, the firm of the González Sada family will file an appeal for reconsideration before the court of appeals itself so that the vote reaches the plenary session of the latter, that is, the five magistrates, since only three voted.
If this is not successful, the appeal of Cerciorare will be claimed, which requires the review of the process by a higher instance, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The seriousness of the case is that the court ignored a document sent by the Mexican government under the figure of amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the Court&quot;), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Bankruptcy Law Mercantile, noting that it was released in accordance with the agreements signed by both countries to tie it with chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Law of the United States.
Moreover, it is pointed out that the country adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, that is, the rules established for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-way carambola: they hit Vitro and they hit the country.
Balance sheet
After the complaints placed on the table by the Mexicana de Aviación unions against the former owner of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, have already found the bottleneck.
The instance headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Attorney General&#39;s Office on an operation carried out by the businessman to extract 198 million pesos from the F/589 trust of Banco IXE, in the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
The resources would have been channeled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administrator.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Close to the Dragon Mart
Gathered over the weekend in a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, of a colossal sales and distribution center facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean for products from the country of the wall, with a housing area at the bottom for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeast to oppose the monumental arena that devastated part of protected areas and raises the mother of all threats against the industry.
ACTA died
After the government sidestepped a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym in English as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already passed to archive.
As you know, the action took place despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility, considering it an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex long term
In an effort to pay long-term debts without affecting short-term ones, the home developer Homex is placing Stock Certificates on the market for 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four identical ones that offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Competitive is born
Made up of the companies NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leaders in information technology, a consortium with the name Competival has just been created, whose objective will be the services market for software clusters in Central and South America.
Investments in the matter exceed 1.5 trillion dollars.
Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes: &quot;Basketball has been my life&quot;
Globetrotter of basketball Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes was linked to the sport of court for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, traveled the entire world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as extensive a mental recollection of local basketball history as Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes.
And it is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a player of minor categories, player of the National Superior Basketball, agent and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Basketball Federation.
&quot;I have put on many hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, such as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and president of the federation during the 90s,&quot; Reyes recalled during a Primera Hora visit. to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife of more than 50 years.
&quot;Basketball has been my life.&quot;
Reyes is not exaggerating in making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all of which are decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his extensive career, attest to this.
Bayamon in the heart
Of all of them, the ones he cherishes with the greatest emotion are those that recall his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years working as co-manager or attorney of the franchise.
&quot;Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboys championships since 1967, either as a manager, co-manager or manager.
There were many years of satisfaction, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, Jerome Mincy&#39;s debut year on the BSN.
From then on, &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took over,&quot; Reyes said.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had coached here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: &quot;I have a very strong player for you, 6&quot;7&quot; tall.
You want it?&quot;
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sharpshooter Raymond Gausse, who was nativized and was one of our best shooters.
I remember that he said that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring another one.
He enjoyed the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but from a distance, since by 1988 he already figured as federative boss.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his performances and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when we beat the United States for the first time during the 1989 Pre-Olympic in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth and should have been bronze if it hadn&#39;t been for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play a second time, Reyes said.
Is that group from the 1990 World Cup the best National Team you&#39;ve ever seen?
It&#39;s among the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave the United States a fight, which was quite similar to the one that won us bronze in the World Cup.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and &quot;Piculín&quot; (Ortiz), but also had young (Javier) &quot;Toñito&quot; Colón and James Carter, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &quot;Quijote&quot; Morales, who had not been able to be in 90 due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and great joy was the 1995 Pre-Olympic team in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like &quot;Canito&quot; Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a youthful Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended for the Pan American mess in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who has been the best player from Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, that has been Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level like Piculín did.
And that without counting his career in the different leagues he played.
Who has been the best Puerto Rican leader?
That is very difficult.
We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young people, I really like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 90&#39;s the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What was left for you to do?
There were things that he would have wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, that the boys from Ponce would only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the Island in the national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of the compulsory certifications and course for leaders, table officials and referees.
That pleases me.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch music videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoying the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as &quot;JR&quot;, in the television series &quot;Dallas&quot;, in the who embodied an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predatory oil tycoon JR Ewing on the television series &quot;Dallas&quot; became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as JR in a new season of &quot;Dallas,&quot; died Friday afternoon of complications from cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the production house. from &quot;Dallas&quot;.
&quot;Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, reenacting the iconic role he loved the most,&quot; the family said.
Larry&#39;s family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died at a Dallas hospital, her publicist, Jeffrey Lane, said.
He brought joy to everyone he met.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, caring, and talented, and I will miss him dearly.
&quot;He was an original person and lived life to the fullest,&quot; Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and acknowledged that he had been drinking heavily for years.
In 1995 they found a malignant tumor in his liver and he underwent a transplant.
Years before &quot;Dallas,&quot; Hagman made his name on television as a decent guy on the light comedy &quot;I Dream of Jeannie,&quot; which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is turned upside down when he finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him in his house.
He was also the protagonist of two comedies that were on the air for a short time, &quot;The Good Life&quot; (NBC, 1971-72) and &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in &quot;The Group,&quot; &quot;Harry and Tonto,&quot; and &quot;Primary Colors.&quot;
But it was his masterful portrayal of the charmingly obnoxious JR that propelled Hagman to his pinnacle of stardom.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in their orbit ran from April 1978 to May 1991.
The catchphrase &quot;Who shot JR?&quot;, designed to build anticipation around an emotionally charged episode in which Hagman&#39;s character is nearly killed, sparked international speculation and millions of dollars risked in bookmakers.
It also helped give the series a ratings record at the time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers tuned in, making &quot;Dallas&quot; the second most-watched entertainment show in history, behind the 1983 finale of &quot;MASH.&quot; which had 50 million viewers.
It was JR&#39;s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
JR impregnated her and then threatened to label her a prostitute unless she left town, but others had reason to attack him as well.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable crook with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and cheating husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), committed.
&quot;I know what I want on JR&#39;s tombstone,&quot; Hagman said in 1988.
It should read: &quot;Here lies the honest citizen JR Ewing.&quot;
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone &quot;huge, on and off the screen.&quot;
He is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each one of us, who were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of &quot;Dallas&quot; were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
Filming had already finished on five of the episodes for the second season and a sixth was in the works, the network reported.
There was no immediate word from Warner or TNT on how the series will handle the loss of Hagman.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in such classics as &quot;South Pacific&quot; and &quot;Peter Pan.&quot;
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to attorney Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York stage in the early 1950s, then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoir &quot;Hello Darlin&#39;: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.&quot;
&quot;I didn&#39;t put anything in there that I thought was going to hurt anybody or affect them in any way,&quot; he told The Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he became an organ donation advocate and volunteered at a hospital to help fearful patients.
&quot;I advise them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and afterwards,&quot; he said in 1996.
I try to offer some reassurance, like &quot;don&#39;t be afraid, it&#39;s going to be a little awkward for a little while, but you&#39;re going to be okay.&quot;
He was also an activist against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Start course that explores the &quot;End of the world&quot;
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook: The end of the &quot;long countdown&quot; of the Mayan Calendar, on December 21, to which clinging to many people as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what was in store for her in the next couple of months: Cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff some have called &quot;debt-armageddon,&quot; and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian end-of-life theorists the times believe that the apocalypse will begin.
&quot;I didn&#39;t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever,&quot; Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If you look at what&#39;s been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for the doomsday minded.
And he is not the only professor offering courses on the &quot;end of the world&quot; this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple, Adjunct Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course &quot;Media, Culture, and the End of the World.&quot;
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
&quot;We looked at why these ideas proliferate over time,&quot; he said, and how they offer what-if scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month students looked at movies with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare to real life examples.
&quot;I have tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible, and impossible,&quot; Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an Adjunct Professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, titled simply &quot;The End of the World.&quot; &quot;.
&quot;We didn&#39;t add &#39;2012&#39; so that you always have the option to teach the course again, in case the world doesn&#39;t end,&quot; Restall said.
Despite the &quot;imminent ruin&quot;, students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work &quot;until the very night the world is supposed to end,&quot; Restall said.
The courses proved quite popular.
&quot;It was saturated in two hours,&quot; Restall said of his high-average class, which filled 35 students.
We received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there were still places.
The students, for their part, say that the course is one of the most interesting.
&quot;I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,&quot; said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religion and sociology major from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old nursing and psychology student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
&quot;I had never heard of a class that could teach that,&quot; he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - let alone a professor - said they believed in the December 21 expiration date.
&quot;Our first project was about Mayan prophecy and we sort of debunked it,&quot; said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old Temple senior from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it&#39;s just a key point on the schedule, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, going back centuries, in which people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom in these speculations.
&quot;In other places people don&#39;t think about this,&quot; he said.
