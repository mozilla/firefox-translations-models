What is counted? The ČSSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor pastry
The new ČSSD councilors in the capital are going to have to overcome, it seems, the obvious language barriers so that the members of the Prague Board and the City Council understand their renewed colleagues from the ODS.
The period Aktuálně.cz &quot;examined&quot; the members of the new ČSSD Council to check their knowledge of the marked slang language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The coded dictionary used by the political cream of Prague during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councilors hardly understand these well-known concepts.
At least, that&#39;s what they say.
&quot;Who is Voldemort?&quot;
&quot;The truth is that I do not know.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m more of a newcomer to Prague politics,&quot; Councilor for Culture Lukáš Kaucký said during the exam on &quot;buddy&quot; terminology.
And as for the veteran politician, Karel Březina reacted the same.
You may be familiar with the concept &quot;golf hole.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s possibly the only expression of all the ones you asked me that I use from time to time.&quot;
&quot;Otherwise, I don&#39;t normally use slang.&quot;
From the glossary, the definitions of which were published by the newspaper Aktuálně.cz last June before the ODS voting congress, the editorial staff chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the Prague municipal authorities.
The socialists had to explain the concepts &quot;Voldemort&quot;, &quot;biggest golf hole in Prague&quot;, &quot;go to the pastry shop&quot;, &quot;bull&#39;s neck&quot;, &quot;betrayal of the capital&quot; and &quot;armour&quot;.
Three councilors agreed to undergo the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who in the future will be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councilor, Petr Dolínek, directly refused to do so.
&quot;I don&#39;t get involved in these things nor do I intend to value how civic democrats have fun.&quot;
&quot;What does matter to me is how we will understand each other in the execution of our programs,&quot; he said.
As we have seen, councilor Lukáš Kaucký supposedly did not realize that the above title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
To Kaucký the word &quot;Voldemort&quot; means nothing; the only term that got it right on the test is &quot;biggest golf hole in Prague&quot;.
&quot;It&#39;s about the Blanka tunnel,&quot; says Kaucký, who immediately adds: &quot;But I rather know about it from the news.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m going to have to sign up for a language course,&quot; he jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka Tunnel in the golf hole, but also the Councilor for the Environment Lukáš Plachý.
Afterwards, both Socio-Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find that character; furthermore, he suspects the meaning of &quot;go to the pastry shop&quot;.
&quot;I think it means going to a company in Prague&quot;; Plachý is soon told that this is the headquarters of the Janoušek companies.
Like Březina, he indicates that such knowledge was obtained from the news, but that he does not use such vocabulary.
According to test participants, there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms among socio-democrats.
&quot;I asked my companions, but it really seems like we don&#39;t have anything like it.&quot;
&quot;Rather, we use nicknames among ourselves, sometimes abbreviations or puns on names,&quot; says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD, Petr Hulínský, whose party colleagues call Hulda.
&quot;At school they called me Bříza, but I don&#39;t know if my classmates call me that too&quot;, confesses his own nickname Karel Březina.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz tested the name and it works.
To his fellow party members, Weinert is Děda (similar to &quot;yayo&quot;) or, less friendly, Dědek (&quot;old man&quot;), representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they were associated before the elections in deceptions during party sponsorship, receives the nickname &quot;Igráček&quot; (&quot;playmobil&quot;) by some of his peers.
Nicknames are also the only expressions that Socio Democrats tolerate in party parlance.
Hulínský doesn&#39;t like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuálně.cz discovered even other nicknames for this Prague president.
&quot;The truncheon rights doctor&quot; seems to remember that Petr Hulínský obtained his doctorate in law at the Bratislava police academy.
The Government wants to limit the torture of &quot;witches&quot;, as published in a brochure
Women considered to be witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are often of advanced age, unable to work, for example for health reasons, single and childless.
Women who &quot;become&quot; witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the town.
&quot;Men seldom suffer such a fate.&quot;
&quot;Healthy young women are not isolated either, because they help with the work and have children,&quot; explains a nun who, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, takes care of more than a hundred women expelled from their communities in a special residence. .
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual &quot;social measure&quot;.
He issued an informative pamphlet that should help prevent the witch hunt.
However, this has a catch.
&quot;More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,&quot; warns the newspaper Die Standard about the disadvantages of raising awareness in writing.
Witchcraft accusations are also common in other African countries.
In Burkina Faso&#39;s neighboring Ghana, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her in gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors state that it was due to an unfortunate combination of circumstances.
According to his version, the woman was caught in the oil used for ritual anointing.
It was set on fire when the group wanted to &quot;drive out evil spirits&quot; from the woman.
The isolation of &quot;witches&quot; is supported by people of all educational levels.
The Der Standard newspaper quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: &quot;Eaters of human souls have always represented a danger,&quot; he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to appease the witch hunt, in The Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
&quot;The Gambian President Jammeh, following the death of his aunt, launched an extensive hunt for the witches who had allegedly been connected to her death and had attempted to kill the President himself through black magic.&quot;
&quot;To help him, he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president&#39;s personal escort, forcibly took men and women randomly selected from Gambian villages to the president&#39;s property in Kanilai,&quot; he said in his report the organization Amnesty International.
On the farm, the people arrested had to drink a herbal concoction with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of those arrested did not survive their stay on the farm.
After international pressure, they finally released around a thousand detainees.
Bakala&#39;s tenant: heats himself with coal stoves and signs a higher rent
The man, elderly and tough, walked through the doors of the customer service center of the RPG Byty company of &quot;coal magnate&quot; Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of rental flats in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried some documents with the new rental contracts for three floors: his, his daughter&#39;s and his son&#39;s, who is serving a sentence.
The three of them have just been caught by the liberalization of rents.
Instead of CZK 3,500 a month, the son will pay CZK 4,100 a month from next year for a second-rate two-room apartment with a separate kitchen.
&quot;In addition, it does not have hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler,&quot; the man shows with his finger in his son&#39;s new contract, over whose signature he has full power.
&quot;But I signed it,&quot; he explains half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions &quot;incorrect and indecent&quot;, advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7, when it will publish a guide informing how proceed in these cases.
But, before this, the man only makes a gesture.
&quot;Everyone says one thing,&quot; he says with a pout.
Ostrava is becoming a great testing laboratory for liberalization.
After the New Year it will happen with the vast majority of the flats that, in the Czech Republic, were until now under a regulated rent.
Therefore, Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the &quot;laboratory&quot; in person.
The RPG mining lounge is one of four in Ostrava, and by Tuesday at nine it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them is a machine to take a number.
&quot;Rental 2011&quot; can be read on a luminous button on its touch screen.
When pressed, a piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
There is almost no time to even read &quot;157&quot; and the number already appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you&#39;re in the queue.
Soon after, an elderly couple arrives to inquire, but the crowd in the living room is not here because of the new rents.
Most people come to solve regular problems, like in the old days: repair requests, insurance issues and the like.
The letters with the new rental agreements will arrive in Ostrava in the mailboxes of the tenants of most of the 44,000 flats belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in the letters a rent increase of between 15 and 38%.
On November 18, a special window opens at the customer service center for new rentals.
&quot;It&#39;s been running for a week, so it&#39;s just starting,&quot; the workers who are there when the client introduces himself as a journalist respond, after briefly hesitating.
Liberalization and the old flats for Bakala miners are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, they were already discussed loud and clear by the Deputy Speaker of Parliament, originally from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD, and now they appear continuously in the area&#39;s newspapers.
&quot;Twenty years later I want a new floor.&quot;
&quot;They didn&#39;t even change the damn plate in the bathroom,&quot; the man mentioned in the introduction vents.
According to the workers, at the moment mostly retirees come to see if they receive a discount on rent if they sign on time, as RPG&#39;s special offer promises.
Remaining tenants who sign the new lease before December 15 will also receive half of the February rent discount.
However, the mining &quot;liberalization&quot; window undoubtedly fails to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
&quot;Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, only about forty or fifty people asked about the rent in 2011,&quot; estimates the employee at the window.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings about contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the rent, the matter must be resolved by an independent judge.
&quot;This is not a threat, but information on the only possible way to proceed and completely in accordance with the law,&quot; warns RPG on its pages.
&quot;No one is going to be judged here,&quot; says one of the RPG Byty employees, and a man who is on the street in front of the customer service center agrees, at least in part, with her.
&quot;I receive a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means to go to court,&quot; he says.
But, immediately, the employee sows doubt.
&quot;We&#39;ll see&quot;.
&quot;Mr. Zaorálek warns them in the media not to sign, so maybe people will wait,&quot; he says.
Rent regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
&quot;Current rents still do not even cover the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund,&quot; recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, adding that the neglected state of the community fund is angering to tenants is, for landlords, the main reason for raising rent.
While during the five years that elapsed between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest four billion in apartments with rents, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5,200 million.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, in front of the waiting room seats, now repeats some data that is highlighted in red.
&quot;The rent increase in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of RPG properties.&quot;
&quot;In addition, it will always be a maximum of CZK 7.50 per month per square meter,&quot; it says on the screen.
Only increased by 38% the rent of 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
&quot;In such cases, it is an increase from extremely low amounts of SEK 19.66 per square meter,&quot; says RPG.
In 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that the liberalization will not hit rents all at once, but will escalate between four to eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rent increase (see the graph) back into the apartments, mainly in heating savings: new windows and heating.
The people who sign the rent increase agreement will have priority.
Architects have understood that offices also need a nursery
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say that it also hides a small nursery inside with everything typical of such facilities: colored walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can attend.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, whose studio produced numerous well-known buildings in Brno, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-nursery.
The company employs around 90 people, mainly in the baby boom age, and they wanted to allow architects and draftsmen to return to work soon after maternity leave.
Along with the possibility of enjoying reduced hours, the daycare is one of the benefits that Arch.Design offers its workers within the framework of its social program.
Builders and architects thus have the possibility of combining a demanding profession with childcare.
The mini-nursery was the idea of the Arch.Designu employees themselves and, with the support of management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.
The company&#39;s mini-nursery is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Program for Human Resources and Employment, as well as from the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (an endowment of more than 2.8 million CZK) they were able to buy the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified personnel and services.
When the funding is exhausted (two years), the company Arch.Design is required to keep the mini-nursery running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and the company Economy Rating contributed to the presentation of the financing request.
Children&#39;s care is in the hands of qualified personnel; In addition, a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present all day to care for them. The nursery currently welcomes children with no age limit, although most of them are less than three years old.
Since it is a &quot;mini-nursery&quot;, it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with shifts more come during the day.
The operation of the crèche is flexible to adapt to the needs of the parents and the children of all the workers have the same right to use the crèche, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is individual teaching and care, the contents of the mini-nursery program are comparable to the regular pre-school programme.
In it, children not only play, but also receive quality education: from basic learning to preparing for school, they even teach English.
The class not only has toys and board games, but also a computer for the children.
The presence of small children in the company itself create a friendly and positive atmosphere.
Parents can drop in to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up children late from school when you are away from work.
Thus, parents are more productive while working.
Not surprisingly, this naturally creates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the firm companies that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program reinforced personnel marketing.
The house of bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Take a look at Gaudí&#39;s interiors
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs resemble the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies resemble the open mouth of a fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Due to its skeleton-like shape, locals nicknamed it &quot;the house of bones&quot;.
Its organic forms, its striking colours, the novel use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a façade reminiscent of scales and the ubiquitous gently curved lines, all of this is typical of Antoni Gaudí&#39;s secession.
The front of the house plays with dreamlike lines, delicate colors and textures taken from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, one observes a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought out order.
At night, the entire facade of the house looks even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the brilliance of the colors is enhanced.
It meanders and the torsion of the forms continues to surprise us also inside.
Corrugated wood copies window frames, railings, door trims, peepholes, and signs.
Casa Batlló, which is located in the Eixample neighborhood at number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Grácia, arose from the remodeling of a house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in the year 1906.
The investor, wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on tearing down the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí&#39;s idea of a cheaper and novel reconstruction.
However, Casa Batlló, made up of various apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep María Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in his plans for the project, decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used on the facade arose.
Other creators and artists also work on the façade.
Collaboration in the Casa Batlló proposals was the beginning of Jujol&#39;s successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí&#39;s Casa Milá and Park Güell, where other parts of it are located.
Due to its organic shape, locals soon after its completion nicknamed it &quot;the house of bones&quot;.
Others, due to the specific mechanism for opening the windows, began to call it &quot;the house of yawns&quot;.
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, the sword of Saint George, patron saint of Catalonia, appears.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious motives.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system for the house with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
Its forty-five degree inclination may seem strange.
During construction, Gaudí did not respect the construction regulations of the time at all and was not influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permit from the beginning, although obviously the data indicated in it on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, upon its completion, the city council was so shocked by the result that they asked that it be corrected
It bothered him, for example, that the construction included columns even up to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, quite the contrary: just fifteen days after the council&#39;s request, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself settled on the lower floors.
On the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The six-story house is completely crossed by a staircase that leads to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all the angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connection of space.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the rooms and a larger group can communicate in this way without problems, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with Gaudí&#39;s reconstruction, not only got a new façade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles that cover the interior patio and skylights.
The game with the two colors provides maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colours, which instead absorb the sun&#39;s rays.
Anyone can visit Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and ornate apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that it is a very profitable business and they expanded the visits to the common area and the attic, including the roof terrace.
The entrance fee to the monument is not negligible, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, pensioners and holders of tourist cards get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of the entrance of other Gaudí constructions in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real atmosphere of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly make friends with a resident of the neighboring houses and visit him at home.
How to choose the mattress and box spring: women and men look for different things
No pompous bed frame; What really gives a good bed its quality is the surface to lie on, that is, the mattress and the box spring.
Above all, they must complement each other perfectly so that they adapt to the specific users.
Numerous elements come into play during the choice, including the owner&#39;s weight, height, state of health, and gender.
The type of interior in which the mattress and box spring are located is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they &quot;warm up&quot; more slowly.
In addition, they usually weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
Consequently, it is necessary to turn them over more frequently.
If the channels in the center are not properly aerated and, above, are on a firm base, they keep moisture inside. Mold may even appear underneath.
When choosing a bed, customs also influence.
Anyone who has spent a lot of time abroad often uses a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling comfortable on a lower, harder surface.
&quot;Almost every hockey player who came back from the NHL complained that they didn&#39;t sleep as well here.&quot;
&quot;For their crushed shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of memory foam.&quot;
&quot;This type of mattress is also recommended for people with diabetes who have nervous system problems, so they receive poor information from the joints and the skin,&quot; explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in padded furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred memory foam mattresses.
&quot;Today there is no problem anymore, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico.&quot;
You no longer have to be an NHL player to appreciate memory foam.
This &quot;miracle&quot; works in a very simple way.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape based on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; During the night, it won&#39;t spin like after a hard game.
You just sleep better.
The memory foam also works as protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the length of your feet to its height, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of around 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for one person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example single rooms, a minimum of 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
So that a possible visitor is also comfortable.
&quot;If not, a simple rule of thumb can be applied to calculate the width: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably tucked in towards the elbows,&quot; advises engineer Helena Prokopová, an expert at Cechu čalouníků a dekoratérů, who has been in the field for many years. of the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture, a subject that he teaches in specialized schools.
In double rooms, everyone needs their own box spring and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to match the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the bed bases at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14cm, innerspring models a minimum of 15cm, of which at least 3cm is for the form-fitting and softening layer.
&quot;When touching it with your hand or sitting on the mattress, the springs should certainly not be noticeable,&quot; warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of box spring.
Fully padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese twins, do not make sense in the bedroom.
Mattresses breathe badly and you can&#39;t wash their cover, which is often done today.
And, since we perspire between 0.2 and 0.75 liters of sweat each night, it&#39;s clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime guarantee.
However, everything has a but.
Therefore, sellers give advice: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take care of cleaning and washing the cover carefully, but better add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattress covers are currently manufactured with a zipper around their entire perimeter, so when they are opened they remain in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their handling in larger models size (and by a single person) lifting the mattress can seem like a fight between a flyweight and a heavyweight.
In bed, instead of a box spring, do you have a firm board?
Never!
At most for beds designed for visitors to spend one night.
However, you must (if you don&#39;t already have them) make ventilation holes in the board and must be used with a mattress with inner springs and a minimum height of 15 cm with pocketed springs (such as German Taschenfederkern) and a layer soft.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-adjustable slatted beds containing between 14 and 18 slats, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (for example, a combination of latex and coconut fiber) can be used, although a bed base with a higher number of slats is always better. sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lower back are reinforced and their rigidity can be regulated.
Adjustable slatted bases should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to recline.
In addition to slat stiffness adjustment, the shoulder protection can also be used.
It is a special fixation of the sheets that allows you to press or even tilt the sheets in such a way that they perfectly &quot;surround&quot; the shoulders during sleep.
For men with very broad shoulders, this is very important.
They are even remembered by mattress manufacturers who, in the &quot;masculine&quot; ones, began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are bed bases with a cross or slat structure with the so-called multi-torque damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is lowered.
You should also keep in mind that even if you use the right mattress and box spring, if you use a bad (big and &quot;fluffy&quot;) pillow, most of the benefits will be lost.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow must support the head and the corners can only reach up to the shoulders, so that the muscles can relax.
The recommended suitable size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on your side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder bolster or the softest area of the mattress) as your shoulder height.
Modern mattresses have something to do, it seems, with the original straw-filled mattresses.
Manufacturers continue to use, more and more often, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are in fashion.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane foam is made, are filled with natural oils, for example castor or soybean.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soy.
&quot;Organic, in the case of mattresses, means that the core is made only of materials of natural origin,&quot; explains Petr Vašíček from the company Tropico Plus.
Likewise, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh scent of forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men &quot;cool&quot; with plant extracts from the breeze, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, women prefer to &quot;warm&quot; the cover.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so that women feel more warmth.
Current favourites?
Mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than normal polyurethane and offers more permeability.
The combination of different stiffnesses of cold and viscoelastic foam allows us to manufacture mattresses with different zones that know exactly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns and up.
Those that perform a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered as sanitary means.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and box springs.
Sometimes you can approve offers from manufacturers or sellers, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with Memory foam attached to the cover for SEK 11,990.
The second is obtained for free.
The era of memory foam with an open cell structure and high density began with the &quot;cosmic&quot; material from Tempur.
Initially it emerged as a material for NASA, because during takeoffs the astronauts were subjected to an enormous overload.
Tempur softens in the heat and hardens in the cold.
Consequently, the warm human body exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores from occurring, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Memory foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and provide relief and circulation.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents use people tracking devices to control their children
Fear for their children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially intended for vehicle tracking, can also track the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in cases such as the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Anička Janatková.
At the moment the device is about the size of a matchbox, but it will soon shrink to the size of a watch.
Many people were scared by the case of the missing Anička and they began to report on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
&quot;We are all trying to tell ourselves that this is not spying, but another way to reduce the chances of a tragedy,&quot; says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
&quot;I recognize that in certain cases such devices can be abused, for example if they get into someone&#39;s bag without their knowledge, but we haven&#39;t come across such cases yet.&quot;
&quot;Most customers really buy it for security reasons,&quot; adds Pilin.
In his opinion, children should always know what the &quot;little box&quot; is for and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns against the fact that if the child does not want to take it, he will simply throw it away.
&quot;Even the youngest children show great creativity in intentionally losing certain things if they want to avoid being controlled.&quot;
&quot;Before, parents relied heavily on cell phones, but they could be turned off just as easily as the tracking device,&quot; says Bočková.
In his opinion, it is debatable whether such a device is really useful in the event of an attack.
&quot;If it&#39;s a staged kidnapping, the perpetrator will almost always check to see if the child is carrying some sort of electronic device that could give away their location.&quot;
&quot;Now it&#39;s the phone.&quot;
&quot;As the use of tracking devices becomes more widespread, you will also be looking for them, since their sale will undoubtedly be carried out with a lot of publicity.&quot;
&quot;In such cases, criminals are always one step ahead of the police,&quot; says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the event of an impromptu attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech from the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if the tracking device is immediately destroyed after an attack, its presence can help.
&quot;You can configure the device to regularly send the position after a certain period.&quot;
&quot;If it takes damage, it will at least make the last position of the person in question easier.&quot;
“More expensive devices have a built-in tilt meter, so if the person simply slips and freezes, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question,” Čech says.
In his opinion, such a service can be obtained even with smartphones with navigation, where only special software has to be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment they are about matchbox-sized devices or the smallest mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Macro Weil&#39;s Pilin, that&#39;s why tests are currently underway with devices that look like a digital watch.
&quot;In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential attacker may not identify the device.&quot;
&quot;Or that it identifies it after a certain time, which can save the police time,&quot; he adds.
Whether the tracking devices are worn on the wrist or dangling, they will still use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is position checking with a GPS system (used in normal car navigation) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough matchlocks to encircle the whole of the Czech Republic. But they only last two years
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of fuse to ignite explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of fuse to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the useful life of the wick is two years, four at the most.
The army bought the fuse for explosives from the STV Group, as for forty million crowns.
The General&#39;s staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of match by saying that soldiers need 60 kilometers of match per year for training maneuvers.
According to the calculations of the army pyrotechnicians, with whom MF DNES contacted, it is nevertheless decided that, in such a case, such maneuvers with frequent use of explosives should be carried out every year also by all generals, high command officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They wanted defense minister Alexandr Vondr and army captain Vlastimil Picek exempted.
Only in this way could it be justified that the army spends sixty kilometers of fuse.
Such a length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if it did, the army would have enough supplies to last more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as the experts say, for the initial training of each new professional he arrives with a maximum of two meters of fuse, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of engineer or special units) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade recently complained personally to Minister Vondra because they say that they have little ammunition for various weapons, so even shooting practice is limited for money.
And let&#39;s not talk about the lack of underwear.
&quot;I also fail to understand how they repeatedly buy such amounts of wick from us.&quot;
&quot;But it&#39;s their decision, and they will certainly know why they are acting this way.&quot;
&quot;For us, the military is a good customer that we as a company try to satisfy,&quot; admits STV Group Sales Director Jan Děcký.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of kilometers of fuse, also saying that he will have stocks of this &quot;ammunition&quot; for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký from STV Group points out that the fuse only has a useful life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or police, two years.
&quot;If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four,&quot; says one of the soldiers who, due to possible criticism from the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of its useful life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it is still reliable and will not harm soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, when buying 445 kilometers of fuse, it obtained a discount.
&quot;They cost us 60% less than last year&#39;s order of 244 kilometers,&quot; says Pejšek, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry&#39;s purchasing center.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of fuses by police pyrotechnicians, who dispose of ammunition from the Second World War or that left by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always ask for just enough to deplete the ammunition before its useful life ends.
They decided this for safety reasons for the pyrotechnicians and, in addition, more modern and reliable types of fuse can be obtained in the meantime.
The Ministry is already clearly struggling to finish tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the 200,000-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing for a campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current one: hundreds of kilometers of old fuse will have to be removed, which is now being bought &quot;cheap&quot;.
Until now I continue living from the contacts I got thanks to the contest
Winning the &quot;Entrepreneur of the Year&quot; contest helped Lukáš Pytloun in the sale of his hotel franchises.
In the last edition, the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec won the &quot;Entrepreneur of the Year&quot; contest.
His success story sounds like something out of a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad, he realized that Liberec needed quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings she gathered from seasonal jobs abroad and a loan from the bank, she bought a five-story house that was half-ruined.
Considering that he was still studying his third year at the university, he was really brave.
&quot;Nowadays, the value for money accommodation in our area prompted me to do something about it,&quot; says Lukáš Pytloun.
He started renting the rebuilt first floor to foreign workers.
Any income he earned was invested back into the building, which he gradually converted into a 54-room boarding house.
Since then, in seven years in business, he has gradually managed to open four pensions, two fine-dining restaurants and two hotels in Liberec with a total capacity of around 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year another of the same quality opened.
&quot;We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise,&quot; said last year&#39;s number one businessman.
&quot;This sale of licenses for the opening of hotels was greatly helped by the fact of winning the &#39;Entrepreneur of the Year&#39; contest,&quot; Pytloun adds gratefully.
The victory increased his fame and popularity both in Liberec and in the surrounding area.
&quot;People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice,&quot; he recalls.
Without a doubt, he recommends to everyone who wants to try any company that participates in the contest.
But he considers that it is not necessary to win, but participation is already beneficial.
He affirms that, until now, he continues to live off contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he might not have obtained.
&quot;With some people I met thanks to the contest I have started to collaborate regularly.&quot;
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included employees,
in total about seventy.
&quot;I&#39;ve seen them show greater loyalty and are proud to be involved in something that got mainstream recognition.&quot;
&quot;It is by no means my own personal success, but rather the result of the hard work of the entire team.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s just that it&#39;s my name that&#39;s on the front page,&quot; says Lukáš Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a calmer year than we have had at Farmet
The euphoria for the victory soon dissipated due to the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the victor&#39;s hard work, Farmet may be past the worst.
The owner of the Farmet company, Karel Žďárský, received the first prize in the last edition of Vodafone&#39;s &quot;Company of the Year&quot; competition, last year in the &quot;Slavic House&quot; in Prague.
The jury appreciated his efforts, with which he managed to turn a small technical workshop in Česká Skalice into a company with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
&quot;I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my employees and improved our confidence to fight the competition,&quot; says last year&#39;s winner.
The history of the Farmet company begins with the desire to do something useful.
For this reason, when the State proposed to Karel Žďárský&#39;s father to rent a small workshop as compensation for the seizure of property during communism, he did not hesitate too long; He resigned from his position at the company where he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, they founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They also obtained a greater presence among the non-specialized public after achieving success in the contest in the media.
&quot;Not only our customers began to see the Farmet brand as considerably better, but also foreign partners began to value collaboration with a company that was more successful in their country,&quot; says Karel Žďárský.
Last year perhaps it was not just a sample of the euphoria of victory at Farmet.
It also obtained recognition for commercial results up to 2008 and, partially, 2009.
And precisely the year 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening of the crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to halt their investment projects and begin to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
&quot;We, of course, are not spared from such a situation either.&quot;
&quot;Revenues dropped by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some layoffs,&quot; explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must sometimes take even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company&#39;s profits, albeit at lower levels than before the crisis.
Despite everything, where Farmet did not cut expenses was in research and development.
&quot;With the grants, we have built a research and training center, strengthened our presence on the international market, and received excellent reviews at national fairs,&quot; says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Revenues are up again and with them the number of new employees.
&quot;The new achievement is expected to bring a feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere,&quot; says Karel Žďárský.
A survey that reveals the ridiculous rules
The Absurdez survey of the year is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
It has already managed to remove some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdez poll of the year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was made by more than a third of the nearly 4,000 voters.
For example, the Social Security Administration required an extract from the business register, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
&quot;The Czech social security administration will no longer ask for an extract from the company register when it checks the insured&#39;s deposits,&quot; said ČSSZ spokeswoman Jana Buraňová.
The objective of the Absurdity of the Year survey is to consult the rules and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must respect and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year, for the fourth time, it is part of the business tournament of the publication Hospodářské noviny and is beginning to create fans among the general public as well.
While last year&#39;s edition had the participation of three thousand voters, this year it practically reached four thousand.
Not surprisingly, since we still have plenty of various legal obligations that need to be followed just to trade.
&quot;Perhaps we are first in the world in terms of the number of papers required for tax returns,&quot; says Karel Havlíček from the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Businesses and Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business rules has been a stated goal of all governments for years.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation is improving especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, the Czech Republic is in 74th position, that is, eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the contest closes.
Proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. The contest organizer then chooses seven candidates for the &quot;anti-prize&quot; and, during October, allows the public to vote online via www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that receives the most votes wins.
More than a hundred submitted for this year&#39;s survey, including 105 rules and regulations that don&#39;t make sense.
The examples were submitted by both businessmen, professional associations and journalists.
Among the &quot;finalists&quot; of the contest was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that businessmen with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of this year&#39;s seventy proposals is published on the contest pages.
The announcement of the contest, which always takes place at the beginning of November in Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world usually participate.
This year, for example, this event was attended by Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of small and medium-sized companies and entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
&quot;Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State continually hinders businessmen, which is why my goal is to eliminate a minimum of thirty paragraphs each year that currently unnecessarily complicate trade&quot;, announced the Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek .
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations do not remain in borage water.
In 2007, what bothered people the most was the employer&#39;s obligation to notify the business office in the area of permanent operation three days in advance of the intention to attend a fair or exhibition with a position.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that finished second in number of votes in 2007, that is, the communication to the labor office by its foreign workers of work trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the so-called green card .
And the third time is the charm.
The Absurdity of the year 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a fridge and two floor scales in their office.
For this reason, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospodářské noviny contest is the category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
&quot;In this way we want to support companies that are concerned with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities,&quot; says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year contest.
For this new special subcategory of this year&#39;s edition of Vodafone Business&#39;s 2010 main competition, companies for which commercial success is not the only long-term goal were submitted.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely from one to another, the common denominator is the support and consideration that they offer.
In one case, it concerns, for example, disabled people, in others personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Republic, for example, was the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company in the Pardubice area is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main funder for sponsoring disabled children for seven years now.
In Poděbrad, there is a stationery store that is especially concerned about the health problems of its workers, since they make up more than 70% of the workforce; for this reason it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of the Czech Republic and in the Vodafone Company of the Year contest it finished third in the region.
In Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours a week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it buys primarily from Czech manufacturers, supports community activities in the area, and respects the environment.
&quot;We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities have the least possible impact on the environment,&quot; explains businesswoman Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; In addition, it supports working from home and uses the catering services of a local protected company for its corporate events.
&quot;In addition, we support the Person in Distress scholarship, which specifically helps the local Roma community,&quot; says company representative Ondřej Suchý.
Also in a good place with a mention is the laundry company Praní a čištění from the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that are passed on to their pension funds.
&quot;We give benefits in food, transport, upskilling and leisure,&quot; says Josef Strapáč from the winning Bruntál Czasch construction company in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the Responsible Company of the Year category, all the regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year contest were automatically designated who answered the questions on the registration form and sent it to the organizers before August 15.
The organizers removed from the evaluation the forms that were not complete or erroneous.
&quot;If the representatives of the contesting companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year contest, but they are not disqualified from the &quot;main&quot; Vodafone Company of the Year contest.&quot;
&quot;Individual entries for this competition are not allowed as it is a sub-category of the main Company of the Year competition,&quot; explains Karel Goldman of Bison &amp; Rose consultancy.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building, in Pilsen
The anti-corruption police made several arrests at the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
Detectives handcuffed a local businessman from the media sector and real estate businessman Luboš G.
Apparently, he tried to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of the rights in such a way that the auctioned land would be received by a specific interested party.
He had to pay Luboš G. half a million crowns for this.
&quot;At the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public bidding,&quot; Pilsen chief prosecutor general Antonie Zelená told Právo, adding that at the moment she cannot divulge more details about the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
As to the way in which it could have influenced the public auction, given the little official information, one can only speculate.
Agricultural Fund spokeswoman Lubomíra Černá responded to Právo&#39;s questions by saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at the Pilsen headquarters and it was during a public auction.
&quot;This is a client, not one of our workers,&quot; he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called &quot;Call for the submission of land transfer proposals in accordance with the law on land&quot; and is held when various interested parties appear in relation to the offered land.
&quot;These people, during the call, offer a value higher than their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced.&quot;
&quot;Based on the offers, the order of the buyers is determined and, later, the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person who offers the highest offer,&quot; explained the Fund&#39;s spokesperson.
Luboš G. had information about who was going to submit to the call and, since he is also an interested person because he acquired various restitution rights, he proposed to those interested in the land that he would not participate in the auction.
For such a favor, he was charging a commission.
This would explain why, at the time of the arrest, he had so much money on him.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
He was listed in the case of former PF chief Václav Sankot, who was indicted for dispatching the replacement of land for which a building decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained land from the Fund intended for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular at the place where a large road to the Borská pole industrial area should be built.
Later, he exchanged them in a very beneficial way with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the municipality had to intervene because, otherwise, the blocked land would prevent construction.
Families will have to pay additional expenses of several hundred crowns per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher rents.
As a result, families will have to take several hundred crowns a month more out of their wallets from January than now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, gas by around 2%, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10% more for water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The increase in electricity for families living in apartments should amount to about 100 kroner more per year than now.
However, the main electricity providers reduced prices, as support for the production of energy from renewable sources, particularly photovoltaics, has increased.
However, gas becomes moderately more expensive, especially at a time when heating is used the most and, therefore, the consumption is higher.
In this case, they must also count on a couple of hundred crowns more per year.
As electricity and gas become more expensive across the country, the price change for central heating varies from place to place.
The price increase is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay an additional 50 SEK per month for central heating from January, while families in Liberec will pay more than 1,000 additional SEK per year.
Residents in Prague will also have to bear a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially in case the city increases the rent for infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, Praguers will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will still be among the lowest in the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will become more expensive by 7.4%.
The rental prices of 450,000 rented flats in Prague, where the regulation will end in January, may rise considerably.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns around 2,500 flats in Ústí nad Labem, will increase the rent from January by up to 100%.
The company will take those who disagree with the new lease to court.
Regulated rents, which benefit the residents of around 300,000 apartments, could increase next year by up to 10%.
Czech youths get drunk on Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer in mode, because it takes effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
Those are the drinks that lead to young drinkers under the age of fifteen ending up in medical care.
Children who end up lying in the hospital all the time to get over a hangover are no longer an exception.
This stems from the experience of physicians encountering such cases on hospital pediatric admissions.
&quot;Drinking beer or wine is not in fashion anymore, because they take a long time to get drunk.&quot;
&quot;Now the fashion is strong alcoholic beverages,&quot; Luděk Pelikán, head of paediatrics at the Hořovice Hospital in central Bohemia, tells Právo.
&quot;When they manage to grab a bottle from their father out of the cupboard, it may be whiskey, but usually it&#39;s Fernet and vodka.&quot;
&quot;Vodka has the advantage that it lightens up with juice and doesn&#39;t smell as much,&quot; he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokesperson for the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
&quot;Normally, it&#39;s usually Fernet or rum.&quot;
&quot;Those are modern spirits, particularly among schoolchildren.&quot;
&quot;In some cases, they use brandy they took at home,&quot; adds Jurinová.
According to Chief Pelikán, thirteen and fourteen-year-old drinkers are the ones who usually appear in hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where she has been working since this year, she worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances brought young people from nearby areas.
&quot;One girl had to enter maybe four times.&quot;
&quot;It started at the age of twelve, when they brought her in with 3.5 alcohol in her blood, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy,&quot; says the department&#39;s doctor about this case.
&quot;He was at the Holešovice fair at some dance party.&quot;
&quot;The interesting thing is that her mother wasn&#39;t even surprised that her daughter disappeared for 48 hours,&quot; the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance towards drinking by their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, one cannot properly speak of dependency.
&quot;An alcoholic is understood to be a person who has been chronically dependent on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children.&quot;
&quot;In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment,&quot; explains Chief Pelikán.
According to the spokeswoman Jurinová, this year at the Motol pediatric clinic, forty drunken children were hospitalized until mid-November.
However, the statistics only show those who come with severe poisoning and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after a mobile medical examination, go home with their parents or with the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases in which the children simply gather after school and drink brandy, for Pelikán there are three seasonal highs and lows that are worth mentioning: Halloween, New Year&#39;s Eve and the end of the school year.
&quot;In such a circumstance, they drink because of bad grades or, on the contrary, they celebrate the start of the holidays.&quot;
&quot;On the day of the witches I have come to see up to seven drunk children at the same time in admissions,&quot; adds Pelikán.
Drinkers who spend the night in detox under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage of not having a terrible hangover at home the next day.
The morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided with the injection of a serum with glucose and with the nutrients that the body lacks.
&quot;These take it much better, because after the hectic night, they get up well and do not hurt at all.&quot;
&quot;They&#39;re just confused about where they are,&quot; says Pelikán, adding that patients often lose their good humor, at least when they see the expenses they&#39;ve incurred.
Transfer by ambulance and hospitalization in a critically ill room can cost tens of thousands of crowns.
&quot;I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when I visit to tell the children directly how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend the whole summer in a youth job for you to earn enough to pay for that night. Pelikan adds.
Health insurance, in his opinion perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually reimburses people for treatment costs, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are found for the first time in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 planes out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the Casa C-295M plane, left on Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the Casa aircraft - EADS is located.
It is the first time that such a device has been in the hands of anyone other than the Czech military.
At the moment, they were only abroad for practice or demonstration flights.
It is the two-seater version L-159T1, which until now was used by the Czech army and was still airworthy.
The three remaining aircraft are single-seater L-159.
These are still kept at Aer Vodochody and the intermediary for the sale, the Omnipol company, already took charge of them last week.
Jan Peješk, from the defense press department, indicates that it is not yet known when the planes will be physically withdrawn from Vodochody.
&quot;The single-seater L-159 planes, on the other hand, were separated from the planes that had been repaired a long time ago, without additional investments or contributions from the Ministry.&quot;
&quot;The L-159T1 two-seaters were exchanged in their current state,&quot; he told Právo Pejšek.
He added that the army does not run out of two-seater aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody in the amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-seaters.
One of the new planes was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has promised that the aircraft will be added to the equipment of some allied countries.
&quot;In the contract it is clearly indicated that the EADS company is the one that withdraws the L-159 aircraft and that they will be used for the training of pilots from NATO countries.&quot;
&quot;Therefore, it is up to the buyer to decide how they are going to use them in this framework,&quot; says Pejšek.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published ahead of time that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in L-159s.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa plane and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defense did not call a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense leadership claims that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired 72 aircraft from Aer and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft may possibly have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defense before the European Court of Justice because it should choose the planes by conducting a European tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa planes and the last one should arrive at Prague&#39;s Kbely airport in fourteen days.
A longer index finger than the ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the index finger longer than the ring finger are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British cancer journal.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
&quot;Our results indicate that relative finger length may be a simple test of prostate cancer risk, particularly for men up to age 60,&quot; said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Research on cancer at the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, particularly if prostate cancer is associated with genetic risk or other detrimental factors, such as family health problems, Eeles says.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the index finger of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They were just as likely to have prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were the same length.
In the case of men with an index finger longer than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men aged less than 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he is aware of the study, but does not think that the relationship between finger length and cancer can be &quot;fully proven&quot;.
The Czech Republic under snow: the D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, woke up Thursday covered in snow.
Roads and sidewalks are mostly covered in compacted snow and snowplows drove through many areas overnight.
In the morning, the D5 highway between kilometers 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov was closed due to several accidents involving commercial vehicles and passenger cars, as was the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the Ústředního automotoklubu (ÚAMK).
At kilometer 91 a truck broke down, at kilometer 93 two industrial vehicles collided, causing injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 highway at kilometer 185 in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers should drive slowly behind Brno at kilometer 190 or through Brno and merge at kilometer 182 in Kývalce.
Jams of several kilometers have formed there.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 ºC.
Traffic jams are forming, for example, in Prosek, although Štěrboholská is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Míru.
At eight o&#39;clock in the morning, another state of crisis will take place in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections for three express.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travelers should check what the current situation is.
Ruzyně airport was closed from eleven o&#39;clock on Wednesday night until five o&#39;clock in the morning.
Currently, most of the roads in southern Moravia are now drivable, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska three secondary roads are closed to traffic, in Brněnska snow patches are forming and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain access roads to the highest points.
One of the hardest hit places was Vyškovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
To clear them will require milling machines.
At the moment it is not possible to say when they will be opened for circulation.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
The roads in the region, which, since it is a protected natural area, must simply be left inert, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow cover reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, around 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfall is gradually subsiding in the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new &quot;smart weapon&quot;
The US military is using a new &quot;smart&quot; weapon in Afghanistan, currently known only by the code name XM-25.
The generals hope the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and &quot;change the game&quot; towards their victory.
The new weapons are like a small pistol and with extremely accurate aim.
Its bullets are fired with a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
The special 25mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high explosive charge it contains causes it to actually function like a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, wall, or trench.
Normal protection certainly cannot be used, and when he unleashes his murderous rain of metal splinters, he can prove essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who discussed the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use &quot;smart&quot; technology.
&quot;Soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, aim their laser beam at it, which determines the distance, then get a precise aiming point and, based on it, correct the line of projection and pull the trigger.&quot;
&quot;Let&#39;s say 543 meters have been measured.&quot;
&quot;When the trigger is pulled, the gun loads and launches the projectile a distance of 543 meters, plus or minus one, two or three meters,&quot; says Audette.
400 jobs are transferred
The Fujitsu group moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will move their workplace from their former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese concern Fujitsu moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specializing in computers and computer maintenance announced on Wednesday, 400 men and women will relocate in July of the following year from their former office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, a large office complex on the street Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term another 100 more employees of the consortium, who were previously scattered throughout the region, will be housed there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
Furthermore, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, &quot;In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with an excellent infrastructure.&quot;
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company in the region yesterday caused joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against.
The head of the Frankfurt economic section, Markus Frank (CDU) stated that this has earned him a &quot;Global Player&quot;.
This is a &quot;magnificent recognition of the site.&quot;
Fujitsu settles in the city, the settlement is a big boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (The Greens) laments Fujitsu&#39;s decision.
The management informed the city in advance of its intention.
&quot;Naturally we have offered the company our help,&quot; Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, economic reasons caused the fall.
In such a way, there is now a big empty spot to fill in the famous position.
&quot;I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative.&quot;
The building formerly used by Fujitsu on the Rathausplatz and the neighboring &quot;Kleine Vertikale&quot; were part of a controversial construction project for the spa town with the remaining buildings on Marienbader Platz for ten years.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the town hall, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for criticism regarding the massive construction that previously used the gaps as parking spaces and regarding the level of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment council and appraisal companies, the manufacturer of software for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, were installed, as well as then Siemens joined with the Fujitsu computer manufacturer.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt real estate group Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu, a Tokyo-based consortium, is recognized as the world&#39;s third largest IT provider.
It has companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides the necessary services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the next subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company with the name of TDS.
That is why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex from the twenties, its name alludes to its star-shaped plan, houses, among others, the central electrotechnical association and the electronics industry.
Amazon shuts down server - Threats against Assange
The anguish seizes more and more of Wikileaks.
Internet service provider Amazon has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
Political pressure may be behind it after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is reportedly in custody in England.
Wikileaks&#39; disclosure platform is always the target of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
The internet activists lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an internet homeland in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol&#39;s wanted list, must remain in custody in Britain, according to an article.
&quot;Wikileaks banned from Amazon server.&quot;
&quot;Speak freely in the country of freedom,&quot; the activists of the revelations communicated through the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company, Amazon, had removed the Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had turned to the publication of secret diplomatic documents on the web service Amazon in order to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
Using Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following: &quot;Perfect, we will use our dollars to hire people in Europe.&quot;
If Amazon has problems with free speech, &quot;they should stop selling books.&quot;
Amazon halted Wikileaks&#39; use of its server after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, CNN reported, according to a call to Lieberman&#39;s office.
The presidency of the senate council for the country&#39;s security had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British &quot;Guardian&quot; reported.
&quot;I had wanted Amazon to take these steps sooner, before the previous releases of classified information through Wikileaks,&quot; the senator said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
&quot;The illegal, monstrous and inconsiderate prosecution of Wikileaks puts our national security at stake and threatens life in the world,&quot; the independent senator said in a statement.
&quot;No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with its service to spread stolen material.
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol&#39;s wanted list.
According to an article in the London newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot;, the 39-year-old Australian is being held in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The internet activist has consistently branded the investigation in Sweden as a plot by his enemy.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there have been threats.
&quot;There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange.&quot;
That is why there are fears for Assange&#39;s safety, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the Wikileaks founder remains unrevealed.
Hrafnsson evidently reacted to the North American statements.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, said that the person responsible for the WikiLeaks disclosures should be tried for treason and should be executed.
In Canada, an adviser to the head of government Stephen Harper stated, clearly with irony, on television, Assange should &quot;be assassinated&quot; and Obama could &quot;use a drone.&quot;
Between the White House and Assange a great dispute grows.
Robert Gibbs, US President Barack Obama&#39;s spokesman, called Assange&#39;s call for the resignation of the secretary of state &quot;ridiculous and absurd&quot; if she is responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in espionage.
&quot;I&#39;m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,&quot; Gibbs said.
&quot;Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than your website.&quot;
The American government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of the protection of its databases in a general way.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution for the National Counterterrorism Center, has been named exceptional manager, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing &quot;major structural reforms&quot; that are necessary in light of the Wikileaks leak.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the American government announced that in order to take care of the security of dissidents and activists, they must jeopardize the publication of Wikileaks.
&quot;We have done everything possible to contact them,&quot; said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
&quot;We are prepared to help protect them if necessary.&quot;
ice cream university
At the &quot;Gelato University&quot; in Bologna, ice cream makers are prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream makers has the highest number of visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream actually come from?
Of the gelatiere and the gelataio.
The gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making.
The gelataio scoops the ice cream from the counter with a spatula, spreads it on the wafer and sells it.
To know this, it is not necessary to go to Anzola dell&#39;Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice cream should not visit the &quot;Gelato University&quot; of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in the year 2003, so that the ice cream from its machines fulfills the high Italian ideals throughout.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream makers has the highest number of visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice cream shop of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new professional career, others risk their vague desires in the soft ice cream.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
A teacher of this art from California, Jacky loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and wants to create something of her own in a few years in an enervating job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
The ice cream master Luciano Ferrari then explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
It is not only its good taste that is decisive, but also its silky softness and its good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his training or the cream cover of the national superior house and mainly from the south of the country: &quot;Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that is why each ball has something romantic.&quot;
The first step to the elaboration seems very easy.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which heats everything up to 85 degrees with an electronic program and immediately cools it down to four degrees.
Then he opens the tap on the machine and a pasteurized white basic cream comes out, the base for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can the ice cream be made only with natural elements or without stabilizer?
How can you unleash some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises that they lose track of the trends of the time.
Whoever talks about ice cream &quot;not only from natural ingredients&quot; may have used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, from guar beans.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you just have to buy it a day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite into a resounding granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic dough are allowed.
scents are used.
Regarding the taste of the ice cream, the teacher Luciano distinguishes among the ingredients those that are bought in the fruit section or in the candy section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastes.
&quot;All vendors will try to sneak flavored ingredients into their merchandise.&quot;
&quot;However they must experiment sometime.&quot;
Whether with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream from the basic white mass, which with eggs will turn a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as a base for all the possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now the course participants can use the ice cream makers.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream each time, with or without eggs in the basic dough, with more or less vanilla flavoring or other natural ingredients.
They perform the same experiment also with types of fruit ice cream.
That it tastes better does not necessarily depend on having more toffee aroma or more fruit purée.
It is not necessary for the hazelnut ice cream to taste like nuts, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The task force makes the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water, and slightly less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mix brings out the flavor of the ice cream, says Luciano.
The preparation of ice cream is an arithmetic problem: Peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be lowered.
Lemon ice cream requires an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano takes out a utensil with which he fixes the amount of sugar of the types of fruit (winemaker&#39;s measurement for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately the tables facilitate the account.
Making ice cream requires no more than physical application, as before.
Not only does the utensil help for the automatic preparation of the basic dough.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously whipped and cooled to subzero temperature.
Despite everything, all the automation is left out in terms of the little pasta.
Brazilian Gustavo smears himself and his teammates from top to bottom with fruit puree, like a giant mini-primer out of control.
&quot;In all the courses&quot;, affirms the teacher Luciano, &quot;it is only a matter of time before something like this happens.&quot;
Inspectors in a difficult situation
The European food safety authority Efsa has infiltrated the industry that experiments with transgenic plants.
This issue is currently formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which considers itself an institute for independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
&quot;It sounds like a conspiracy theory but we haven&#39;t documented it well,&quot; Christoph Then, head of Testbiotech, said in Munich on Wednesday.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert have also been employed by the Ilsi association for years.
Consortiums like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer pay for it.
Kuiper has collaborated significantly in Efsa&#39;s verification standards for genetically modified plants, which places him in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
Efsa&#39;s provisions are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation of Ilsi&#39;s situation and mimic the deed of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
It is the second time that Testbiotech criticizes a collision of interests.
So recently a senior Efsa manager went without support or transition time to Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed sides with it.
Recently, the Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and industry, carried out by the General Office for the Environment as well as a clairvoyant EU parliamentarian.
However, Efsa cannot acknowledge any conflict of interest.
All formal data is used, including some from the industry, as long as they are of a high technical quality, they are arranged in a report.
Experts working at Efsa are not required to have no contact with industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper supports his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the US.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying commission.
On this issue, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating the food for the animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
&quot;We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn does in agriculture,&quot; Then says.
The current practice consists in verifying only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
&quot;If you don&#39;t look for risks, how are you going to find them?&quot; Then asks, accusingly.
Angelina Hilbeck thinks the same way.
The scientist has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this area, industry in the US and Europe is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
For this reason, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published as a rule.
&quot;Industry controls security research,&quot; Hilbeck maintains.
the trail of stones
Uli Gsell has gotten a few, totaling about 400 kilos.
On Monday he was in front of the Stuttgart station, with the tuba on his back.
there were demonstrations
It was snowing.
The story is well known: In September the bulldozers arrived and began to tear down a large chunk of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never the same again: Thousands and thousands demonstrated against s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
Since it was sealed off, most of the wing became rubble.
Broken in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, he is 43 years old.
He&#39;s secured a couple of chunks.
&quot;These stones are relics.&quot;
&quot;They must not disappear.&quot;
He enthuses: &quot;A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural.&quot;
As he once said, he has smelled cigarette smoke.
He still doesn&#39;t know what to do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tubingen at a former French Army ammunition depot, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old deals with ancient stones.
He has bought everything that results from the demolition in Stuttgart.
&quot;There would be disgrace, they would grind up the gravel or send it to the dump,&quot; he says in his office, a small wooden house that was once a guardhouse.
They insulted and threatened him, he explains, when, in September, it appeared in the newspapers that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition company.
He talked to the enemies of 9/21 for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing about the demolition.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
Some 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilo massizo cut, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a souvenir but also with the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had purchased 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half are still in the woods, the rest have long since been sold.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could carry in the trunk and on top.
The Stuttgart stone of the impulse has long since become &quot;the wall&quot; or the delimitation of the Kräuterbeeten.
&quot;Actually this stone is nothing special,&quot; Rongen says.
&quot;If it weren&#39;t for the political component.&quot;
He climbs into his jeep, takes a tour of his vast 50-acre kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he is interested in computers and finally works with stones.
And he is a lover of stones.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
He transports his treasures throughout Germany.
He claims to be the largest dealer in ancient stones in the country.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic chopped sandstone stones.
&quot;They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke bridge,&quot; he explains.
Dawn limestone, yellow, warm, is enthusiastic.
&quot;My dear stone.&quot;
The path crosses the forest.
He points to a lot: Red sandstone, an old chunk from the Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
&quot;Nice travertine.&quot;
Formerly the mazizos belonged to the Stuttgart Neckarstadion grandstand.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite from the Sankt Blasien church, tuff from the Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how he carved the stones before and moved them with a simple tackle and cart, he feels very devoted.
&quot;It would be a scandal if something was destroyed.&quot;
He has not become rich, not filthy rich at all.
But today 14 people gave the stone dealer a job, plus stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glazier and a gardener have settled up in the woods.
&quot;We work hard, but it&#39;s satisfying,&quot; says the man in charge of taking advantage of the remains.
In a little while he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue there.
Fight of talents around great potentials
There is an active crowd at the buffet.
16 students crowd around the rolls, tomato soup, and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of ideas contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with the VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
Rivaling and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, meet in hand-to-hand combat around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Their mission: Hire the most talented students from universities as soon as possible, before they enter the job market and are hired by others.
And since universities do not provide publications on the skills of their students, an attempt is made to spot exceptional talents in hands-on projects and recruit them.
On the second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins over the talents.
A lady from the personnel department hands out pens, gummies and folders with the VW logo.
He explains the internship programs and student jobs to the excited young talents and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig is leading the project with VW.
He sees advantages for both parties: &quot;Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience.&quot;
&quot;In turn, VW can get to know the students, take a closer look at interesting candidates and consider them as potential future employees.&quot;
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are desired so directly.
&quot;The main focus previously was on technical projects,&quot; says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large pool of applicants.
If not, they have to advertise and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All students in engineering disciplines are in an excellent bargaining position.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI for its acronym in German), in October there were 40,000 vacancies for engineers.
And according to VDI forecasts, this engineering gap will grow even larger.
At the audit and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of headhunting.
It runs expensive recruiting events, like the KPMG race, a type of modern gymkhana, in which participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the US next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of selection at the start.
Only the crème de la crème of many entrants goes to the US.
Universities are putting more effort into selecting and nurturing high potentials from universities, according to Dykta.
&quot;With the career we want to stand out from the crowd.&quot;
&quot;The simple journey alone was not enough for us.&quot;
For talent scout Dykta, grades pay off.
&quot;Until today we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants.&quot;
&quot;Some are nearing the end, and they want to apply to work with us,&quot; he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also on the hunt, especially small and medium-sized companies, classic with their job fairs.
&quot;We try to get students at specialized fairs.&quot;
&quot;Something about Intersolar,&quot; says Sitha Stübe, people manager for solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner company has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problems of the new generation.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company&#39;s website.
&quot;It is being very difficult to fill the vacant positions.&quot;
&quot;It costs a lot of time and money,&quot; he says.
A shorter way is the contact with the professors of the university.
Solarworld collaborates with various higher schools, for example the University of Freiberg.
&quot;The professors advise that you can do internships with us or do your theses.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: Personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
&quot;A large corporation cannot normally offer it,&quot; says Stübe, the personnel manager.
When looking for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
Decisive factors are flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld is ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The institute draws up an annual list of the best German job providers.
For which it asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and with the environment in it and observes the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the personnel manager, also expects extra points in her ranking from her job applicants.
&quot;I think the applicant looks especially at the external ratings of a potential employer,&quot; he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy to build a good reputation as employers.
He advises his clients more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
&quot;The best way to become attractive as an employer is through the employees themselves,&quot; he says.
In the jargon of the sector it is called Internal Employer Branding, also promotion of corporate identity within the workforce itself.
&quot;Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.&quot;
When you treat people well and identify you with the company, then you get promotion directly to the employer from friends and acquaintances.
&quot;It&#39;s like a gang game,&quot; says Kriegler.
Obama Halts New Oil Drilling
From the coast of the US state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in recent years.
The Washington government issued a forceful prohibition and with it annulled its previous plans in an unappealable manner.
Also off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited for the moment.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What caused this strict ban, which will be in force for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; oil rig in April.
Before the disaster that killed eleven workers and caused the biggest environmental catastrophe in the US, President Barack Obama had allowed new drilling in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under opposition and industry pressure.
Supporters thus wanted to lessen US dependence on fresh oil supplies from abroad.
Until today, it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable oil slick in the Gulf.
At the center of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which is faced with millions of lawsuits.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, different oil consortiums submitted requests for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by using tougher controls and stricter security regulations.
Currently the responsible control authority, which after being accused of corruption charges has fallen into disrepute, is being reformed from the ground up.
Obama announces in parallel that lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the gulf will be lower thanks to stricter regulation, to date.
&quot;Government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries,&quot; says the result of the current survey carried out by the consulting firm BDO - before the extraction ban on Wednesday.
American Energy Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: &quot;No one knows exactly what changes with the regulation.&quot;
Investments in new extraction projects are prolonged for the time being, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water in the rivers is oily brown, it smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of crude oil spills have destroyed nature in Nigeria&#39;s Ogoniland.
People live off theft, corruption and the illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari is fine with it.
&quot;Don&#39;t get tired&quot;, the environmental activist reassures the journalists: &quot;Today enough oil will pass before your eyes.&quot;
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wading chest-deep in water with the glint of lights reflecting off turbulence on the surface: With the colorful shimmer of the water, the scene looks almost pretty.
You can&#39;t see that brown oil stains are floating on the surface.
I used to catch handfuls of shrimp here, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the flowing waters are totally dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was spilled into the formidable wetland from a broken pipeline.
Fish from around the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach fish-filled waters: which, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most plague-ridden regions in the world.
On the path of the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship&#39;s engine stirs up a brown broth, whoever dips their hand in the water will get a few full of oil.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark licorice sticks, sadly isolating the colliding palms and dangling palms.
Flocks of birds are searched for in vain, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the barrier from the outside falls silent, a kind of ghostly calm from a former paradise with the smell of gas station expands in it.
&quot;What&#39;s going on here is an ecological struggle,&quot; says Celestine Akpobari, sullen. &quot;We live in constant danger to health.&quot;
The warlike comparison proceeds.
The area of the Ogoni settlement has been a hotly fought battlefield for years: the first European explorers broke into it here more than 60 years ago, the first resistance was organized here in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed , the Shell group had to establish its first factory here in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today the return of companies to Ogoniland is prohibited: While pumping daily more than two million barrels of black gold from the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction sources and 7,000 kilometers of pipeline, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters, steel platforms protruded like bizarre sculptures from the water: &quot;Christmas trees&quot; they affectionately called the heads of the drillers.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
Every moment a head fails, says Akpobari, so a constant stream of oil gushes into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion liters have been poured into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the breakdown of the ship &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; 21 years ago in the Alaskan Sea, one of the greatest ecological catastrophes in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the enduring environmental region, will deal with it.
While the Shell consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting heads and leaking pipelines as the main culprits.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards normally the world&#39;s conventional ones, scientist Richard Steiner chided the consortium in 2008: Only the pipe defect rates are &quot;about a multiple higher than elsewhere.&quot;
In a place that seems forgotten from afar, a workshop full of oil appears under the open sky, figures emerge from the mangroves: They are naked and covered in oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to the perforations, sometimes scattered arbitrarily on the ground, a fire is burning: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil is heated on the fire for more hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
Firstly, gasoline enters through the pipes into the container, later the oil pipe leaks and finally diesel comes out.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300-litre barrels of diesel daily: &quot;It brings us 34,000 naira&quot;, around 22 dollars.
The inhabitants of the delta take advantage of the fuel shortage in one of the biggest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria only has a single refinery.
With the absurdly cheap diesel price of just 40 euro-cents per liter, illegal heaters can offer even less: Thus they reduce the value of their raw material.
It comes from &quot;those of the bunkers&quot;, who tampered with the network of pipes that crosses Ogoniland: According to experts, at this rate at least 16 million liters of oil are lost every day throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a negligible part of the temporarily stored raw material is clearly refined illegally: Organized criminal networks, which also include politicians and high-ranking military officials, store the best part in cisterns and sell it cheap on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers the debate on whether the environmental catastrophe is due rather to the management of the population or to the weak way of production purely academic.
&quot;If the oil companies did not behave like invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no robberies, no illegal refineries.&quot;
While the conditions of the Ogoni are destroyed above all by Shell to the point that only one deduction from the consortium appears: &quot;Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, such as Chinese.&quot;
Michael gets nervous.
&quot;It&#39;s about time you disappeared,&quot; says the muscular Ölmann.
&quot;The soldiers can come any minute.&quot;
If the special unit of the army catches the illegal refiners, it does not threaten them with arrest, but with a painful bribe.
The soldiers coming from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to profit from the raw material.
&quot;This damned invention has completely torn our country to pieces,&quot; says Akpobari.
Researchers find dangerous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently the A380 has a big security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, investigators found a possible manufacturing defect, which can lead to &quot;catastrophic engine failure.&quot;
The airline Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus that made an emergency landing in early November were much luckier than you might imagine: Australian air safety authorities realized through their investigations that there was a major engine safety issue on some A380s, and alert of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: Fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused in a sleeve connection, ATSB officials announced in a report released Thursday.
This could have caused &quot;catastrophic engine failure.&quot;
This affected Rolls-Royce-manufactured engines belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among which is the Qantas-Airbus that had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline initiates legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in Sydney federal court which opened up further legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, stated that his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the engine mark they have lost parts and its wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers announced that they will carry out further safety tests on superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, a spokesman for the ATSB.
The security issue has become significant enough to inform everyone affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline grounded its A380 fleet for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily grounded approximately three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa replaced an A380 engine as a precaution.
This double-deck aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
A Nationwide Snowfall Causes Traffic Chaos
Totally white Germany: From one day to the next it has snowed in almost the entire country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: Freezing temperatures were reached in almost the entire country overnight on Thursday, which has triggered traffic chaos in many places.
In parts of the north and east, there is a 15-centimeter-thick layer of snow.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and on many streets.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the snowplows are in continuous operation, removing new snow again and again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong gusts of wind sweep the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects spring tides with the water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the Schleswig-Holsteins Baltic Sea coast.
In Saxony the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on motorways and national roads.
According to the Meteomedia weather service, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There is partially 30 centimeters of freshly fallen snow there and cold and strong winds are responsible for swirling it.
Many trucks and cars were trapped there overnight.
Also in Saxony Anhalt the police authorities reported major disorders in the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia snowfall affected the A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disruptions are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and in northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, fallen trees on the rails or broken catenary and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, the intercity service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
The fire brigade and rescue service cared for the 165 passengers on the train with woolen blankets, food and drink.
Snowy winds sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, snowy winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport spokeswoman, there are already 40 canceled flights.
The snowplows are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers stranded at the airport, despite that there are 400 tent beds prepared for them.
In many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon a trucker died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg a similar accident occurred due to the snowy streets: Here too a truck was hit at a railway junction because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after her car rolled over near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will become increasingly soft and powdery and therefore swirl in gentle gusts.
But the wind will lessen.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will undoubtedly continue to be very cold, in some places down to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank seeks a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to part with its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Deutschen Bank recently spruced up its headquarters: The twin towers in Frankfurt&#39;s banking quarter were modernized; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium apparently wants to profit from the renovation costs, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the &quot;Financial Times Deutschland&quot; claims, based on a spokesperson.
The spokesperson did not name the reasons for the proposed sale.
&quot;We always check whether to own the properties or sell them and then rent them back,&quot; he said.
This is why Germany&#39;s largest credit institution relinquishes its company headquarters again after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from an investor in a house fund and then made the necessary arrangements.
The energy reforms reached figures of approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would mean a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field estimate the value of the newspaper towers renamed &quot;Greentowers&quot; at around 500 million euros.
Whether the renovated buildings are sold in a bank fund or to an independent investor has not been disclosed at present, the spokesman said.
Thousands of people mourning the deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of entombed miners, who were presumed dead after many explosions at a mine.
The bodies have not yet been found, because security measures continue to be precarious at the scene of the disaster.
Almost two weeks ago an intense explosion took place at the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was inserted into the site of the misfortune, but found no sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue team could go down for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts deduced that there was no chance that the miners had survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Currently family and friends remember the deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have been changed by the resplendent brilliance of the sun in Greymouth on New Zealand&#39;s South Island.
They are silent for two minutes.
In homage to the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal items, underneath clothing and surfboards.
The flags were flown at half mast in front of the country&#39;s government buildings.
New Zealand hoped the miners would return to the surface &quot;from the depths of the earth,&quot; John Key, the New Zealand Prime Minister, told participants at the memorial service.
&quot;But they never came home.&quot;
She cannot accept her son&#39;s death until she has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Together with the president of the government and the relatives of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative act.
In the first explosion on November 19, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began by extinguishing a fire inside a coal mine on New Zealand&#39;s South Island.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, the searing temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, Gary Knowles, the police superior, told reporters.
To hell, warrior!
Does gore fit into artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn once again explores the frontiers of the genre with his battle epic &quot;Walhalla Rising.&quot;
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have in mind when shooting &quot;Walhalla Rising&quot;?
An imprisoned one-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and slaughters his enemies with near-superhuman fighting sounds ideal for young viewers looking for gory action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods of killing and tearing the guts out of his enemies alive when he&#39;s in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as his real name is, says almost no words throughout the film and the other characters are carried away by at most one or two sentences or a couple of pitiful death screams.
Otherwise they shut up and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountainous landscapes of Scotland, which the scenes offer to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown filmmakers interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has multiple audience groups it&#39;s a shame they can&#39;t rule each other out.
Director Winding Refn regards his savages and drug-dealing &quot;Pusher&quot; hairstyle trilogy as some kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with any more humor in mainstream or something less than artistic house brutality.
A brain mass and gushing guts can&#39;t deter most fans of arthouse cinema.
Most action fans are bored to death, if Unojo takes a ship to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and gets stuck forever in the calm and fog before his team reaches America and shut up again there.
It is a pity that &quot;Walhalla Rising&quot; has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only released on DVD.
It&#39;s a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody facade, hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema, which deserves some attention.
This movie is not about dialogue or logical action, it&#39;s all atmosphere, a fever dream turned into a movie.
And that is why there is no escape for the spectators.
Refn grants himself just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the gloomy trance soundtrack make his throat choke, especially the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a little blond young man, who faithfully supports One-eye, retains something like innocence, all the others are possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any moment a warrior out of hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
He represents doom, but maybe only to those who are lost anyway.
&quot;Walhalla Rising&quot; is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, angry, upset and surprised.
An experience.
mysterious earth movements
The nuclear energy organization IAEA has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this issue until controls are allowed.
Around midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubical building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of Euphrates; the largest and nearest city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
His name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley that comes out of the river.
According to information from the US international intelligence service of the CIA at the end of April 2008, a current reactor was designed under the name of the vicinity of el-Kibar, very appropriate for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons.
Instead, the technique hardly serves any purpose other than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the components of the reactor were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs that showed the building from nearby or from inside.
The reactor had only been in operation for a short time, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is hardly better known than at that time, the enigmas have become greater with time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was absolutely certain that the Syrians had built a reactor at el-Kibar, but that he saw little indication that in the country had a &quot;nuclear weapons program&quot;.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of a &quot;supposed reactor&quot;, although they consider the CIA&#39;s presentation &quot;plausible&quot;.
They lack solid evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how safe it was to have a reactor ahead, a senior UN diplomat responded in a lapidary manner in the summer that the IAEA has &quot;enough material to have questions.&quot;
The Syrians very quickly cleared the rubble of the alleged &quot;unused military building&quot; and thoroughly leveled the ground.
However, in June 2008 an IAEA team under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in el-Kibar, which had been man-made.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images over a member state from commercial vendors in the moments just after the attack, which must be of greater informational value than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
This is why the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always implied that it has never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as implausible after analyzes of the particles.
Since then, Damaskus has refused to discuss it, in the same way that he has refused to discuss the satellite images.
In addition, the controllers are prohibited from a second inspection in el-Kibar and from entering the ruins of the bombed building.
Also Israel keeps a strict silence.
&quot;We will never comment on it,&quot; Ehud Olmert, acting prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has yielded no results since June 2008 and &quot;progressively becomes a serious credibility problem for the authorities&quot;, as a high-ranking Western diplomat corresponds to a place at the IAEA in Vienna, is finally pending a serious violation of the treaty on the non-proliferation of atomic weapons, which is monitored by the IAEA.
The IAEA considers three more pieces of equipment as the key to progress in the clarification, which must be &quot;in functional connection&quot; with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not disclosed publicly so far what equipment is involved, what functions it has, or whether it seems suspicious.
According to the Süddeutschen Zeitung newspaper, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as inmates, again derived from the proximities of the located cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these locations and located a building complex near Masyaf using satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly located in or immediately next to a military base, Syria for this reason prohibits entry to all three locations to the IAEA.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians fear a search that the US has requested from the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were on the lookout for the equipment thanks to warnings from the US secret service.
Through satellite photography, the IAEA has indications that material is being moved between the three locations and the bucket on the banks of the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the pieces of equipment may be &quot;related to fuel production.&quot;
But there is &quot;no indication of sensitive activities,&quot; or uranium enrichment or reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered by uranium that is not enriched.
Where the uranium must come from and where the plutonium for the bombs must subsequently be separated, for these central questions there are at best plausible assumptions.
There is also no question as to whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are found in all three places.
As the hundreds of truckloads from the ground disappeared, no one has any information on where the rubble remains.
The OIAE considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located in the few kilometers from el-Kibar to the other side of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its suitability as an area for radioactive waste, to be unlikely.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious Jane&#39;s Intelligence Review.
But photographs from orbit show that the Syrians carried out earthworks at the three suspected suspect sites and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be coincidence but it hardly helps to dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA has spent a few months to develop a plan for inspections there, which the Syrians allowed, to maintain possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the inspectors&#39; interest.
Meanwhile, Damaskus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured themselves that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter is not very urgent, for a couple of months, Glyn Davies, a type of US ambassador, has been waging the calls exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, which is due to propose these inspections, has spoken of &quot;an option that I am open to in the future&quot;, but is still hesitating.
This path is very risky: You need a majority of the IAEA&#39;s governing council to do this, and some of the 35 countries represented there aren&#39;t exactly eager for escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat mused: &quot;And what happens if they don&#39;t find anything in the end?&quot;
love in times of war
There are problems since Angelina Jolie began directing her still-unnamed debut in the summer.
She has written the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serb.
Not much else is known about it, but this is enough to stir.
The rumor is very persistent, the Muslim woman falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women&#39;s associations have quickly protested, whereupon at the last minute they moved some days of filming planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the women&#39;s organization of war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, about Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, he informed a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for the refugees.
She is not diplomatic, weeks ago the women offered her a meeting in Hungary that she rejected.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
There are no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie&#39;s position on it gives the victims away enough about the script.
Her organization in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended removing Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly has Jolie written for the scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that read the script, after a tug-of-war, granted a recording permit in Sarajevo, it&#39;s not entirely clear why Jolie didn&#39;t go anyway.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, she enters the Yugoslav conflict with great effort, she wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
Its content remains imprecise.
A second, rather different-sounding synopsis of the film is circulating online: The lovers were together before the start of the war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to a Serb camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the &quot;rape victim falls in love with torturer&quot; variant.
It is certain that Jolie&#39;s film really begins before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie claims, is &quot;unfair and based on misinformation.&quot;
They can currently make peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script remains on the net illegally, like many before.
nothing like far from here
This afternoon is finally good again for the Irish.
no trace of woe
Instead, the home team dominates over their customers from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans whoop with joy as loud music booms, stamp their feet on the ground.
The Bailey club buzzes in Cork South as players throw pingpong balls into beer glasses from a distance of three meters and find each other
The bizarre spectacle is called &quot;Beerpong&quot;, and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the world beerpong championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this quirky drinking game and the discreet computer guy don&#39;t really mix well.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with it, to distract himself from the withering question, what does the future hold for him.
Having fun in Las Vegas is not in his plans, in January he will have a personal interview in New Zealand.
&quot;I have a bad feeling,&quot; he says.
&quot;It&#39;s a long way from home and I still don&#39;t have a job there.&quot;
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, &quot;she got her dream job as an event manager in one shot, maybe that&#39;s a good sign&quot;, says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanners&#39; three brothers have already sought their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin currently works as an IT consultant in London.
Young people leave: On the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish people will leave the country in the near future, forecast economic experts and Dublin&#39;s ESRI social research institute.
Up to 2015 there are 200,000 emigrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, a migratory wave is coming comparable to the one that the island suffered in the eighties.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis confuses above all the young, well-educated Irish, for whom until now, everything is uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of every ten men and women under thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the editor in droves from young emigrants, complaining that: &quot;In Ireland everything is sinking.&quot;
&quot;There should be an uprising against the politicians and bankers, but whoever can, leaves and loses our country and with it an entire generation.&quot;
&quot;Last one to close the door.&quot;
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish Students&#39; Union, sees a bleak future looming as the government is only set up and no longer offers young people any prospects.
&quot;They reduce minimum wages, but they don&#39;t have strategies to get new jobs,&quot; says the 20-year-old girl.
Watch as your colleagues go from one unpaid internship to the next.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
&quot;This idea is sad and depressing.&quot;
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this issue in a positive light.
McLarnon organizes the &quot;WorkingAbroadExpo&quot;, a fair that offers a service around the theme of working abroad.
&quot;For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to direct your career,&quot; says the manager.
On his website there are photos of a boy surfing in Australia and another boy snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not like doing it in the galleys, but rather it brings freedom and fun.
For half a year now, Seán O&#39;Donovan has known what it&#39;s like to build something somewhere else.
Since there was nothing left for the 29-year-old engineer to do, he currently works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
Now they are building a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he goes to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O&#39;Donovan sees his homeland only rarely because he works overtime to pay a loan for his house in Ireland.
&quot;The situation is a bit crazy,&quot; he says, as it&#39;s been a long time since he first stepped on his doorstep.
&quot;I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I&#39;ve never been so good.&quot;
He laughs somewhat embarrassed and leaves through freezing rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with manicured gardens in front of the houses, large and expensive cars are parked in the driveway.
O&#39;Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent financed by a loan.
&quot;Those were crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions,&quot; he says.
Are you afraid of failing with credit?
O&#39;Donovan thinks for a while, pours more hot tea, and says, &quot;I don&#39;t have children to feed and I&#39;m young; if it all goes wrong, I can start from scratch.&quot;
The civil engineer does not like the complaints that he often hears these days.
&quot;No one should go hungry, our situation is by far not as dramatic as in the past here on the island,&quot; he says.
&quot;Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen, perhaps with it we feel like Irish for the first time.&quot;
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
&quot;After seven years he came back and life went on in Ireland, very simple.&quot;
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future pending and simply see what life is like elsewhere.
He&#39;s already worked a couple of years in London, and why shouldn&#39;t he and his girlfriend do well in New Zealand?
But these days there is one thing that worries him greatly: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears it could degenerate into a farewell party.
&quot;Just, not too many emotions,&quot; he says and takes a long gulp of his beer.
&quot;Farewell, sounds very harrowing.&quot;
&quot;We better call it a marching party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games.&quot;
the democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to rise, as does support for private business.
Crime is a bigger concern than unemployment.
Furthermore, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarómetro survey carried out in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, it makes it possible to monitor changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related issues stand out in the results of this year&#39;s survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the relatively lively humor prevailing in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% a year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a low 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a large drop in production last year.
However, only half of those surveyed in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see graph 2).
Some 44% of those surveyed in the region declared themselves satisfied with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably higher than the 25% registered in 2001 (figure 3).
Some 34% stated that they trusted their country&#39;s Congress and 45% their government, the same number as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, the economic turmoil in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has held up during the global financial crisis is probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social safety net has helped protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only marginally in 2009 and has fallen again this year, to 32%.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see graph 4).
Brazil&#39;s good economic performances and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general feeling of progress.
Such sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was most severe and violent crime has increased.
For the second time since the surveys began, more respondents in Latin America cite crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see chart 5).
Some 31% say that either they or a close relative have been a victim of crime in the last year, a figure that is down from 38% last year and the lowest percentage since 1995.
The more positive economic performance is reflected in greater support for private companies and the market economy: around 71% of those surveyed in the region affirm that private companies are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only the 56% (see graph 6).
Some 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of those polled in Venezuela feel the same way (and 80% support private companies), even though its leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the country that exercises the greatest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is the country considered most influential by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds that title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
trash elections
No one expected the November 28 general elections in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they went much worse than foreigners trying to help the country recover from its problems feared.
Votes were put into the ballot box, some people voted several times, ballots thrown into the sewers, polling stations destroyed and acts of intimidation.
Polling stations opened hours late.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, were wandering the area trying to figure out where to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the annulment of the elections.
Protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the senior United Nations official in Haiti, declared that it was &quot;a relatively good election in many ways.&quot;
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that &quot;we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious they may be, necessarily invalidate the process.&quot;
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which opponents say is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce preliminary results on December 7.
The tiebreaker is expected to take place in January.
All hope regarding the elections has not yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition calling for the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr. Célestin, who has little if any support, has moved on to the second round.
With the cholera epidemic sweeping the country and more than a million earthquake survivors still living in tents, strong abstention is expected.
When the time came, many Haitians wanted to vote, but were unable to do so due to a lack of organization.
Around 250,000 identity documents, necessary to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
The stakes are high.
Aid donors view the election of a popular and legitimate government as an essential step in rebuilding Haiti.
And, as has become clear, Haitians themselves think so too.
Tiptoeing towards the center
In the weeks that have passed since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity rating by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level that he has registered since his election in 2007.
Regardless, whether she can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year&#39;s elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs. Fernández puts aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to run economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had a habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the additional income at their discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernández&#39;s government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner&#39;s death of a heart attack on October 27.
Some dissenting members of the ruling Peronist movement have confronted Mrs. Fernández.
However, after chaotic sessions in which one deputy punched another in the face and other deputies accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
&quot;I&#39;m not going to argue,&quot; said the president.
Consequently, the 2010 budget will be applied to the following year, which will offer the president even greater leeway when it comes to spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it will probably grow as much as 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but numerous private estimates, as well as union wage demands, put it near 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who came to power in 2003 when Argentina was on the verge of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, put pressure on the private sector and made INDEC, the statistics institute, adapt the official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now moderate these policies?
He has called meetings between the private sector and union leaders.
In addition, its officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been boosted by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the boost to growth achieved with a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for this reason Mrs. Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina&#39;s financial ties with the rest of the world.
Earlier in the year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of debt that Argentina had failed to pay in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs. Fernández is about to enter into an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes around 6.7 billion dollars.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as is customary.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer &quot;technical assistance&quot; to develop a new national consumer price index, which seems like a prelude to cleaning up INDEC.
It is not clear if President Fernández wants to continue in politics when her term ends, taking into account that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If he does, he will need to win the support of the middle class, much of which has grown tired of Kirchnerism.
When Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have subsided.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, calmly, many of her husband&#39;s policies.
Half hurray for China
Taiwan voters are slowly moving closer to some sort of closer union with the mainland.
What does Taiwan think about its big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those eligible, turned out on November 27 to elect mayors and councilors for five urban wards in what appears to be a sweeping assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become a champion of sentiments for the mainland, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest changes in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just barely.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three out of five mayoral elections, it failed to win a majority of the vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has favored full Taiwan independence, won almost 50% of all votes to the KMT&#39;s 45%.
If it had been the presidential one, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party&#39;s share of the vote has fallen by around 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in the town halls.
The election featured typical elements of Taiwanese elections, including noisy field trucks and large crowds with little flags and scantily clad girls dancing.
Nor was the mysterious assassination attempt missing.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, the KMT&#39;s honorary chairman, was campaigning for one of the KMT&#39;s candidates the night before the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding him and killing a bystander.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine if the man intended to harm Lien or take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, casting suspicion on the PPD and causing voters to lean towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner from the campaign was China.
Surprisingly, the issue of the continent itself was not addressed.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for public accommodation and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and loathes the military threat from China.
Consequently, the KMT often avoids publicizing its ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time, too, the DPP avoided encouraging anti-China sentiment.
It responds to the new realization that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan&#39;s economic survival.
For his part, Mr. Ma said his China policy had been confirmed as acceptable to the majority of Taiwanese.
The Beijing government is expected to continue to bribe them with trade, in line with its strategy to bring Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare for a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
You would certainly like to achieve political integration as well, but first things first.
The best thing will be to wait until after the 2012 presidential elections for it.
In any case, the PPD has reinvented itself.
Two years ago it was in a bad situation: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was jailed on corruption charges.
President between 2000 and 2008, openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under Ms. Tsai&#39;s leadership, a new generation of moderates has emerged, and the PDP is making an effort to attract professionals and youth.
Ms. Tsai has been warmly welcomed as the DPP candidate for the presidency, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything possible to show that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans to create an expert group to act as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided negotiations can take place without preconditions.
Ms Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a &quot;reliable alternative&quot; to Mr Ma&#39;s hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious at the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said the PDP candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen&#39;s intercession, the PDP will have a hard time choosing among its potential candidates.
The KMT must also do some soul-searching.
Mr Ma&#39;s valuations have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Their lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says he will reshuffle his cabinet as well as local teams.
The large showings of the DPP suggest that Taiwan&#39;s support for a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, &quot;the point of no return has already been crossed.&quot;
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise pick in the Breakthrough Artist category.
Act at the request of a president and people may take notice of you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer handpicked by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, delivered one of the surprises at the Grammys this year with a high-profile nomination at the Best New Artist category.
Given that Spalding has been an acclaimed figure in jazz since his 2008 album &quot;Esperanza,&quot; the nomination is sobering, but respects Grammy rules that it must be an artist who hasn&#39;t released more than three albums before recording the one that &quot;determines the public identity of said artist&quot;.
His ambitious 2010 album &quot;Chamber Music Society&quot; was certainly a breakthrough and, considering his light and pleasing vocal style, as well as great ability with influences from pop, funk and Latin rhythms, one can at least establish a distinction between Spalding and Norah Jones&#39;s 2003 road to success, the closest equivalent to Grammy voters, who of late have zeroed in on the jazz realm for this category.
In all other categories, Grammy voters rightfully honored the Vijay Iyer Trio&#39;s &quot;Historicity,&quot; an exciting and magnificent record that was a favorite last year.
Among Iyer&#39;s competitors are veteran saxophonist James Moody on &quot;Moody 4B&quot; and keyboardist John Beasley on &quot;Positootly.&quot;
Trombone Shorty, a raucous favorite in New Orleans and a regular guest on HBO&#39;s &quot;Treme,&quot; was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which otherwise leans heavily toward fusion as on albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James&#39; wild punk Argue&#39;s Secret Society earned some deserved recognition in the big group category, competing against the chamber jazz greats of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the ever-risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, &quot;Pathways,&quot; it was a great example of the bassist&#39;s democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Award Nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey for Best Direction for Classical Albums
The classical music nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
Top nominations went to Michael Daugherty for &quot;Deus Ex Machina,&quot; for piano and orchestra, in five movements, and Steve Mackey for &quot;Dreamhouse,&quot; an eclectic three-movement work for orchestra.
Nominees with ties to Southern California include Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, &quot;Los Angeles,&quot; a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are spread across thirteen categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo albums.
The Classical Producer of the Year category includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for &quot;Deus Ex Machina&quot; and &quot;Metropolis Symphony&quot; by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for &quot;Dreamhouse&quot; by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; &quot;Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati&quot; by various artists; and Verdi&#39;s &quot;Requiem&quot; from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for &quot;Lulu&quot; by the Royal Opera House Orchestra; Adolf Hasse for Ars Lyrica Houston&#39;s &quot;Marc Antonio e Cleopatra&quot;; Kaija Saariaho for &quot;L&#39;Amour de Loin&quot; by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for &quot;The Enchanted Wanderer&quot; by the Mariinsky Theater Orchestra and Chorus; and Arthur Sullivan for &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.

Pärt&#39;s Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The roughly 30-minute piece is dubbed &quot;Los Angeles&quot; and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman&#39;s &quot;Mandolin Concerto&quot; is nominated for Instrumental Solo Performance with Orchestra.
The Los Angeles-based composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for Avi Avital to play on mandolin, who performed the concerto with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
&quot;He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and lots of scales and rhythms from North Africa,&quot; Dorman said in a phone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the orchestral performance category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of works by Stravinsky.

In the classical mix category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of &quot;Roots - My Life, My Song.&quot;
Proposed Temecula Mosque Gets Ordinance Commission Approval
The Temecula mosque project has won the unanimous support of the local planning commission after more than five hours of often heated public testimony.
Critics attacked the bill, saying it encourages terrorism and traffic jams.
However, commission members decided Wednesday night that the new religious center complied with local law and would be aesthetically impressive.
&quot;Many good people came to show their support, whether Christians or Jews or Baha&#39;is, from all faiths,&quot; Hadi Nael, president of the Temecula Valley Islamic Center, said Thursday morning.
&quot;The truth is, as an American citizen, it makes me proud.&quot;
&quot;It shows that justice prevails.&quot;
&quot;The opposition is really minimal,&quot; he adds.
&quot;Just that they talk too loud.&quot;
&quot;In this valley there are wonderful people.&quot;
The meeting began at six in the evening and lasted practically until midnight; most of the time was devoted to people advocating for or against the center, roughly the same number on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper&#39;s website.
&quot;The United States no longer exists,&quot; read one of the comments.
&quot;It&#39;s about another Planet of the Apes with Lady Liberty dead in the sand.&quot;
&quot;America has fallen.&quot;
Plans to build Islamic centers have sparked protests in other parts of the country as well, including near ground zero, the area of New York where the September 11, 2011 attacks took place.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been living together happily in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse he rented on shared property with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque, in a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise as high as 43 feet.
It would occupy 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral High.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the Municipal Council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new life forms on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a rare bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although the researchers discovered the curious bacterium here on Earth, they say it shows that it is possible for life to exist without the major elements they considered essential.
&quot;This organism has a double capacity.&quot;
&quot;It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic.&quot;
&quot;That makes it something very peculiar, although it&#39;s close to being a truly &#39;alien&#39; type of life form,&quot; said Paul CW Davies of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report appearing online Thursday in Science publication.
It has long been considered that there are six major elements essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have discovered that the bacterium, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorous with arsenic.
&quot;It makes you wonder what else is possible,&quot; said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on planets other than Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the convening of a press conference to discuss it, in which details of the discovery were not disclosed, generated a great deal of speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report indicated the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It did not.
What the discovery &quot;does show is that in other planetary settings, there could be organisms that use other elements to power their biochemistry, and that the &#39;standard&#39; set of elements that we think is essential for life may not be as fixed,&quot; said Charles Cockell. , Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the investigation team.
&quot;This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element for another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure,&quot; Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA&#39;s Institute for Astrobiology, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorous are chemically similar, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both might substitute one for the other.
&quot;Arsenic is toxic primarily because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus.&quot;
&quot;Consequently, it can be difficult for organisms to tell them apart.&quot;
&quot;However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn&#39;t work as well as phosphorus, so it gets in and, so to speak, clogs up the biochemical machinery,&quot; Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they managed to adapt to and use to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorous, but showing that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that arsenic-using life may exist naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet. or moon where arsenic is most common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, noted that the idea that phosphorus can be substituted for arsenic is not new, but an example has never been found to show that it works.
Arsenic was more common in Earth&#39;s earliest ages, he noted, so the researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
&quot;It does suggest that there could be other ways of generating life, not just the way life formed on Earth in ancient times,&quot; said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon&#39;s research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
Missing Stolen Dogs Found in Compton
The two missing dogs of the four stolen have been found in front of the Bellflower Motel, Los Angeles County sheriff&#39;s officials said Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis, went missing Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van they were spending the night in outside the Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the canines were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two were found late Wednesday night, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#39;s Department.
&quot;The good news is that the dogs are doing well,&quot; Whitmore said.
&quot;They are in good condition&quot;.
&quot;They have returned to their rightful owners.&quot;
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
&quot;An investigation is underway.&quot;
&quot;We don&#39;t want to say anything,&quot; Whitmore said.
&quot;We are following some leads.&quot;
The dogs&#39; owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached for comment Thursday.
They were reunited with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff&#39;s deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) were unharmed.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit at area shows this week on behalf of the dogs&#39; Japanese owners, were still missing as of Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba national championships in Long Beach this weekend and intended to showcase Trace.
The other dogs were to be shown in other competitions scheduled for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple&#39;s nearly two-month tour of participating in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of their bedroom window.
They brought three other dogs—a boxer pup, a Parson Russell terrier, and a Brittany—who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have very thick fur and would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so the dogs could get fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van stolen Tuesday morning at six.
Peek had said that they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
It was unclear on Thursday whether or not a reward would be given.
The lion is ready to roar again as MGM&#39;s shakeup wins final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally gotten the green light to start over.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the plan &quot;pre-arranged&quot; by creditors to wipe out roughly $5 billion of debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on production. and premiere of movies and TV shows.
Thursday&#39;s ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the US bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles to MGM relaunching under Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become executives. main points of what will be a reduced study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320.
In reality, MGM won&#39;t emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million loan facility to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the loan, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded in mid-December.
The studio&#39;s restructuring process began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to provide management advice to get its finances in order as it struggled to make interest payments of $300 million a year. .
In August, Director Harry Sloan was succeeded by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron Chairman and bankrupt recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Donuts.
Moelis and Cooper&#39;s attempts to resolve MGM&#39;s financial woes and satisfy the studio&#39;s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, in late 2009 the parties agreed to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion that creditors were seeking.
Before the spring of this year, he was back at the drawing board as the MGM team began work on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal debate and disagreement, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper&#39;s companies will receive multimillion-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will get a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper&#39;s companies, which have been raising $375,000 a month for his company management services, will receive a $4 million &quot;success fee.&quot;
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which has released just one film this year, and has assembled an annual slate of seven or eight films due out in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two movies based on &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM&#39;s debt, had been trying to arrange a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to balance its gift budget
While the iPad is the frontrunner for this year&#39;s coolest toy, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can make a significant dent in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five $99 BMX bikes, and a Kinect set costs the same as 10 beaded classic jump ropes, or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy retailers, Wal-Mart, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, and BJ&#39;s Wholesale Club, to see what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore&#39;s Law had been at work; This year&#39;s tech toy will likely have more power, costing the same and even slightly less compared to last year&#39;s.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the best-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offerings.
And button cell powered toys are on the rise, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, unless otherwise noted.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, ages 3 and up) are guinea pig-sized stuffed toys that sing a note when their bellies are squeezed.
One squeeze equals one note, and a second squeeze starts to put together a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start squeezing, you can&#39;t stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, ages 2 and up) is the best choice.
Borrowing from technology from last year&#39;s Elmo Live, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-taking games like Simon Says, and can moonwalk, thanks to his innovative articulated feet with locking wheels.
Children who tested the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, though their parents complained about the lack of a volume control.
If you are a child of the 80&#39;s, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He&#39;s back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, ages 3 and up), with a backpack full of question cards designed to turn a car ride into a witty self-correcting exercise book session.
If you&#39;re leery of giving your child your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech&#39;s MobiGo ($60, ages 3-8) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; while the games don&#39;t teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, ages 3-12), it&#39;s the first major update to the Leapster line, with a newer, brighter screen.
Neither version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL ($90, ages 3-7) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and e-books, and has an SD card slot to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, ages 8 and up) is a game of five blocks barely bigger than a matchbox, each with its own LED display.
The objective is to build words by placing the blocks in a row before time runs out; it&#39;s great for an impromptu word-spelling competition.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
Based on their presence in toy stores alone, the two biggest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2&quot; Mix &#39;N Match Figure Pack, ($5, ages 6-12) that includes a hidden code coin .
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough Club Penguin store credits for two items.
These could include roller skates or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than the bristle on your toothbrush, the Hexbug Nano ($10, ages 5 and up) is the latest in a line of button-cell battery-powered microbots.
The fake insect moves quickly on 12 silicone legs that vibrate in random directions.
It&#39;s fun to make a block maze to see if you can find your way out.
It is also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend some time inside our dog&#39;s mouth.
A more moderate side of China&#39;s policing is promoted
Like an urban drill sergeant, Tang Shenbin paced a city square, sternly inspecting his nervous charges, issuing orders under his breath with military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan, China&#39;s hulking urban law enforcement officers feared and despised for their capricious crackdowns and penchant for violence, to convey a certain impression to a handful of viewers.
&quot;Adamant!&quot;
&quot;Attention!&quot;
Show them, he whispered, &quot;how pretty girls are!&quot;
Four girls barely past their teens in white gloves and identical olive green jackets and skinny pants for attention.
Four pairs of black shoes perfectly aligned.
Four elegant hats sit perfectly on top of hair tied in blue and white striped bows.
&quot;Personally, I think they have a normal appearance,&quot; Mr. Tang said, dismissively.
&quot;The models are cute.&quot;
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China&#39;s urban inspectors.
One city mandated that all new recruits have a bachelor&#39;s degree.
Guangdong Province changed the gray-green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, substituted intimidating looks for the use of force: In 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a wayward snack cart, glowering at it constantly for half an hour, until the street vendor he collected his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 in Chengdu, has chosen a radical makeover.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police, specifically chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the rough cop a softer, feminine side.
Sadly, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China&#39;s paltry respect for these city squads.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors from Hubei Province beat a passerby to death after he used his cell phone to film them breaking up a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for inspectors in Beijing was stolen and posted online, which described how to effectively flog criminals without making them bleed.
Earlier this year, a Shanghai watermelon vendor suffered brain damage after a scuffle with five officers.
A violence-filled video game, available for download online, features Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
&quot;Chengguan has left a scar on the government,&quot; lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded &quot;a really meticulous cleanup.&quot;
Skeptics say the current approach falls far short of this.
After the district advertised for eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered if the women had real duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district&#39;s ad called for female candidates between the ages of 18 and 22, with a good figure &quot;and all five harmonious facial features.&quot;
They had to be above average height, greater than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the work was too physically demanding for women over the age of 25.
&quot;Your image is the important thing,&quot; an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
&quot;First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc.&quot;
Then comes temperament &quot;and inner qualities.&quot;
Female chengguan are like vases, he said, adding, &quot;In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.&quot;
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not eager to endorse that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job advertisements for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
Whether this means being handsome is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the handicapped or disfigured should not appear.
&quot;We cannot allow a lame person or a hunchback to come to work here,&quot; Mr. Zheng said.
&quot;His image would not be right.&quot;
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with flushed cheeks and a slightly curved mouth.
She doesn&#39;t think the accent in her appearance is sexist, she said.
&quot;Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?&quot; he asked with a sardonic look.
His dimpled co-worker Xu Yang, 21, said, &quot;Our work should present the image of the city.&quot;
They also aren&#39;t opposed to their part-time work, they said, because they harbor greater career ambitions than simply scaring off vendors in the alleyways where they&#39;re supposed to do business.
Each morning, the squad faces a dozen or so peddlers who set out on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many buns or bowls of tofu as possible before being driven off.
&quot;Mr. Wang, you have to go.&quot;
&quot;We have told him many times!&quot; Ms. Xu said as a vendor fled on foot, temporarily abandoning her bicycle-drawn cart with noodle garnishes.
The officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
&quot;This is more or less the same every day,&quot; said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in her spare time.
&quot;Very routine.&quot;
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate vendors&#39; merchandise.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to shield them from the sudden public displays of animosity against the bureaucracy, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, Yunnan&#39;s provincial capital, rioted after a false rumor spread that Chengguan officials had killed a vendor.
More than a dozen Chengguan police or officers were injured in the overnight episode; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far avoided such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two streets from the quiet Baoguang Square, where the female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officers had impounded a motorcycle that was being repaired at the curb instead of at a shop, as required by regulation.
The owner of the motorcycle was shouting rudely.
The situation stalemate for 15 minutes before the officers, pouting, elbowed their way to their vehicles and sped off with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the men&#39;s squad, stood behind, his white badge turned upside down to hide his name.
Like the female officers, the coordinators, men aged 40 and over, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain a stylish image.
&quot;Sometimes we fight verbally.&quot;
&quot;Sometimes we fight physically,&quot; Mr. Li said matter-of-factly.
&quot;Most of the time it&#39;s the crowd that starts the fight.&quot;
Prosecutors will not file charges against Senator Ensign
Lawyers for the senator announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have cleared Sen. John Ensign of criminal charges stemming from his affair with a former campaign aide and his efforts to secure a job by lobbying for the woman&#39;s husband.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible 2012 Republican presidential candidate until scandal over his affair made national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign&#39;s office said it was &quot;certainly pleased&quot; by the decision, which came after a year-long investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign&#39;s lawyers said the Justice Department had &quot;informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of its investigation and that it has no plans to pursue charges against him on this matter.&quot;
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign may have colluded to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, email, and other documents first reported in the October 2009 New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped one of his assistants, Douglas Hampton, obtain lucrative lobbying work to achieve the silence from Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator&#39;s affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a campaign treasurer for the Ensign.
Ensign contacted various political backers to find Mr. Hampton a job and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
Because Hampton had recently been an Ensign aide, he was barred by law from lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared at odds with the so-called &quot;revolving door lobbying ban,&quot; which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to conduct personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, &quot;it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door statute,&quot; said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients under government investigation.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reasoning behind the Ensign decision, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department seemed wary of accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for its justice department. public integrity, including last year&#39;s decision to drop prosecution of former Sen. Ted Stevens amid charges of procedural misconduct.
Federal prosecutors &quot;are clearly cowards,&quot; said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
&quot;This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them,&quot; he added.
Paul Coggins, the Ensign&#39;s lead attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and another call the next day, telling him the department did not want to press charges against his client.
Ensign&#39;s defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, &quot;acted in accordance with the law.&quot;
Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
&quot;I don&#39;t feel comfortable going into detail about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision,&quot; he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to turn an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, alleging that a $96,000 payment from Ensign&#39;s parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The electoral commission said it did not have enough evidence to show that the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, which lobbyed for a job thanks to Ensign&#39;s help with Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign&#39;s chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton, telling him he was &quot;dumping&quot; the Home Office on an issue. in dispute.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the secretary of transportation to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after it had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first broke last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as the fourth leading Republican in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, the Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, she said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department&#39;s lead and wrap up its investigation.
&quot;Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada,&quot; he said.
Cheshire&#39;s appeal will target Twitter
There were half a dozen of them &quot;chatting&quot; in the courtroom lines.
Minute by minute, they sent out reports of the gruesome testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed the rape and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut family, is set to come to an official end, with the judge voting for the imposition of the death penalty. by the jury.
But lawyers for Mr. Hayes have filed briefs in court outlining appeals arguments that are likely to occupy courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that the intense reporting on the trial, including the extensive use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created &quot;a circus atmosphere&quot;, and such widespread and immediate saturation with exalting details made public passions exercised an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force appellate judges to grapple with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
&quot;Based on what I have experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual&#39;s rights to due process,&quot; said Thomas J. Ullmann, lead attorney for the defense of Mr. Hayes.
State Superior Court Trial Judge Jon C. Blue laconically rejected the claims in a ruling last week, saying the news outlets were &quot;carefully monitored&quot; and there was no evidence that the jury was brought for the passion
But it probably won&#39;t be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appellate courts have recognized that celebrity case coverage can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in its decision, in Sheppard v. Maxwell, that there was &quot;a carnival atmosphere in the process&quot; due to the media.
The crime is believed to have been inspired by the television show and movie &quot;The Fugitive.&quot;
Some lawyers said that appeals courts reviewing Mr. Hayes&#39; conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the manner of communication from courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time. of Dr. Sheppard&#39;s case.
&quot;There is general cause for concern about the impact of new media&quot; on high-profile prosecutions, said John J. Donohue III, a Stanford Law School professor who has studied the Connecticut death penalty and has written a report stating that it was imposed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many issues outlined by Hayes&#39; lawyers that will likely be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test potential jurors&#39; reactions by showing them lurid crime scene photos during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense attorneys say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty, arguing that the judge improperly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and that it had improperly pushed for a verdict for its bizarre decision to order the jury to deliberate. over a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But his arguments about the effect of intense coverage of the process may attract the most interest.
They noted in a challenge to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed on the campaign trail by candidates for governor and the US Senate.
They argued that the media continually fueled the fire of emotion about the case.
&quot;The daily crush of tweets from the media, cameras and reporters outside the courthouse,&quot; the attorneys wrote, &quot;was unheard of here in New Haven and perhaps in the entire state.&quot;
His focus on Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about immediate news being more important than slower-delivered reports was a Luddite view that would make the court&#39;s policy on coverage control weak in future proceedings. .
But some lawyers said appellate courts were often drawn to arguments about accommodation that was required in courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes&#39; lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In their brief, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which overturned Dr. Sheppard&#39;s conviction for coverage of the trial, and made it clear that they would demand that the new media would require new rules.
&quot;This case,&quot; they wrote, &quot;represents the Sheppard v. Maxwell case of the 21st century.&quot;
Can civility bridge the divide?
After a campaign notable for invective and negativity, a bit of civility has been unleashed in Washington this week.
Is it a harbinger of genuine bipartisan cooperation to come, or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital?
Tuesday&#39;s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no progress on the big issues that must be dealt with during the outgoing session.
But from what everyone is saying, it was at least a polite discussion of the two parties&#39; differences, as well as an acknowledgment of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than just another empty episode to score partisan points.
Wednesday&#39;s public meeting of the president&#39;s deficit commission was equally civil, despite remaining political differences among members.
It seems clear that the close interaction over a period of months generated a mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide that still separates the members.
That&#39;s hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are on a trial run, probing each other for signs of cooperativism and compromise as they try to gauge the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
Which is why the meeting on Tuesday and the subsequent evaluations of it by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep-seated to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it&#39;s taxes, spending, healthcare or welfare, the two sides are at opposite poles.
Still, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
&quot;There&#39;s no question that things have changed in terms of the way we say things,&quot; said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
&quot;They are inevitable after the elections.
Elections arouse partisan passions, which are then extinguished.
That&#39;s good&quot;.
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda for the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush&#39;s tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a compromise to expand unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans can&#39;t make believe they favor tax cuts for the rich by denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday&#39;s meeting at the White House, there is greater optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear disarmament pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution cautions that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112th. Congress meets in January.
On the contrary, he affirmed that it is very probable and even inevitable that a period of disagreement will begin.
&quot;After the things that must be done are done, in the short term psychology will revert the situation to one of confrontation,&quot; he said.
Wehner, too, expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) that civility can lead to true cooperation.
&quot;I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012,&quot; he said.
The reasons have a lot to do with the constitution of the new Republican House majority and the Tea Party voters who were instrumental in creating it.
As conscious as Republican leaders are of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know they must try to make good on their promises to cut state spending and repeal the new health care law.
Those party lines are already clear in the initial reactions to the deficit commission&#39;s recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes and the retirement age, and cutting spending.
Co-Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been tasked with one of the toughest jobs in Washington and, by their own estimation, have forced the deficit issue onto the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been struggling to get anywhere near that number.
The greatest resistance is among the elected officials on the panel, suggesting that on fiscal issues there is, at least currently, little basis or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans in the White House and those in Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and health care, followed later by a period of increased bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to deadlock, as it did in 1995, then both parties will carefully watch the reaction of the people.
Whoever they think is losing will likely change course and seek compromise.
However, this may be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a bigger ideological gap between Obama and congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists in both parties see 2010 as merely a prelude to a more momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility on display this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked US document portrays Moscow as a haven for corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a &quot;kleptocracy,&quot; and it leaves a portion of the bribes and protection money it collects directly to the Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia reported in February.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service are reported to operate huge blackmail schemes, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of the bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the &quot;vertical authority&quot;, takes its share as money moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have consistently denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several libel suits over such allegations.
In September, when asked by a Russian television channel about a documentary that suggested he was corrupt, he said: &quot;It&#39;s crazy, hoax, annoying.&quot;
According to polls, Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it&#39;s unusual to find the details spelled out, as they were in the embassy report, and it&#39;s unheard of for diplomats from a foreign country to do that.
&quot;Moscow city government&#39;s direct links to crime have led some to call it &#39;dysfunctional,&#39; and to claim that the government functions more like a kleptocracy than a government,&quot; the note states.
&quot;Criminal elements enjoy a &#39;krysha&#39; (a term from the criminal and mafia world that literally means &#39;roof&#39; or protection) which is passed by the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD ), and the prosecutor&#39;s office, as well as all sectors of the bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
&quot;Analysts identify a three-tier structure in Moscow&#39;s criminal underworld.&quot;
&quot;Luzhkov is at the top.&quot;
&quot;The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level.&quot;
&quot;Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.&quot;
&quot;This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas because the city doesn&#39;t provide some services.&quot;
The report claims that the SFS collects money from the largest companies, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, the report stated, &quot;explained that Moscow business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) since they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law.
&quot;For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority.&quot;
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, the protection can be spotty; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who don&#39;t pay quickly find their businesses closed for one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports men taking suitcases, likely full of cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
&quot;In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust the bureaucrats,&quot; Georgy Satarov, head of Indem&#39;s Moscow think tank, said in a recent interview.
&quot;But he is a part of this bureaucracy.&quot;
&quot;He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia.&quot;
Without politics, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
On a national scale, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion per year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154th (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The disclosure of the US Embassy note, which did not occur until late at night Moscow time, is sure to cause anger within the Russian government, and while Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow&#39;s weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin claims that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested the WikiLeaks documents might be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation that US diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
&quot;The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country,&quot; he said.
&quot;But to be honest with you, we don&#39;t suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, done in such an immoral way.&quot;
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom with stained and peeling walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School remembered the man who had built it, the last leader of the Ta Mok Khmer Rouge.
&quot;Everyone here loves Ta Mok.&quot;
&quot;He was a good leader and he cared about his people,&quot; said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as &quot;the Butcher&quot; for his brutality during Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where they still live. thousands of former soldiers of the organization.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-held loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook here that for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a mixed United Nations-Cambodia court handed down the first conviction of a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years. from prison.
With each of those events, anxiety has grown among Anlong Veng&#39;s Khmer Rouge veterans, complicating reconciliation efforts and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
&quot;There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they can&#39;t do anything,&quot; said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
&quot;For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.&quot;
&quot;This is creating divisions within families.&quot;
During the Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease, or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government led by Pol Pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary led guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated a following in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country&#39;s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had held out, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest Khmer Rouge fighters fell into the abject poverty that is common in rural Cambodia, and many are nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their arms, the rank and file soldiers remain poor, unskilled farmers.
&quot;These people have gotten little benefit after the surrender,&quot; said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
&quot;They have incorporated the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime.&quot;
&quot;They were raised with no concept of doing business.&quot;
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before dedicating herself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
&quot;Life with the Khmer Rouge was fine,&quot; he said.
&quot;Ta Mok fed everyone.&quot;
&quot;But now life is difficult because we have to provide for ourselves.&quot;
The current Khmer Rouge court has also caused concerns here.
Early next year, the court is expected to start prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court&#39;s mandate is to prosecute top leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will pursue cases beyond those four.
This did not do much to assuage Anlong Veng&#39;s fears.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told investigators from the Cambodia Documentation Center that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers are thought to have died.
On a recent muggy afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his house on wooden stilts on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows across the parched grass, Im Chaem refused to speak of his Khmer Rouge past.
She stated that if the court summoned her, she would not appear.
&quot;Cambodia is peaceful and stable,&quot; he said.
&quot;If there are more prosecutions, there will be war.&quot;
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned of instability if the court goes after more suspects, though this is disputed by experts and historians.
&quot;Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,&quot; he said.
But facing the past is just what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
&quot;Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is putting the broken pieces back together,&quot; he said.
&quot;It is our obligation to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand.&quot;
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, called the 75-page &quot;A History of Democratic Kampuchea.&quot;
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education&#39;s secondary school history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the town&#39;s link to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng Secondary School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But her parents were skeptical when she brought the book home to study.
&quot;My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court,&quot; he said.
&quot;They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people the court will prosecute.&quot;
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
In any case, here the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path overgrown with weeds and littered with discarded plastic bags leads to a soot-black rectangle covered by a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot&#39;s body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside cell phone vendor, said he didn&#39;t know much about the man who was cremated there.
&quot;But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him,&quot; he said.
It was Nuom Sothea&#39;s birthday, and later that day she decided to walk to Pol Pot&#39;s last resting place, where she would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope of good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stockpile of weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama&#39;s campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will give up its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement released after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the US government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium, and it seemed they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But US officials told the Washington Post that a pair of classified operations were carried out with Belarus in the past two months, to remove 84.82kg of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This set the stage for Wednesday&#39;s agreement to remove the rest of the material, roughly 227kg, according to an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the confidentiality of the matter.
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
&quot;I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.&quot;
&quot;This shows that this process is working,&quot; said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement &quot;a very significant and important step&quot; taken by Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the George W. Bush administration.
At the time of Obama&#39;s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
&quot;We have kept highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapons-grade uranium) and low-enriched uranium,&quot; Lukashenko said at the time.
&quot;This is our raw material...we are not going to make dirty bombs, and we are not going to sell them to anyone.&quot;
&quot;We use it for research purposes, that&#39;s all.&quot;
However, Belarus reached out to the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing the uranium from Belarus, in October, was particularly challenging as the material had been lightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to the officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was carried out by plane.
The US government spent $13 million for the tasks, with most of the money used to supply Belarus with the low-enriched uranium research facility, which is unsuitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official who works on Global Threat Reduction, said &quot;this was very carefully coordinated and orchestrated to build trust&quot; that led to the deal Clinton signed.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to remove its reservation by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko&#39;s harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday&#39;s statement suggested a potential détente.
It stated that &quot;while progress on these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains central to improving bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens&quot;.
The Spanish government did not object to the CIA flights
The Spanish government did not object to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners in the direction of Guantánamo through Spanish territory, according to the US ambassador in Madrid in a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents leaked (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then First Vice President of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed in order to &quot;be able to demonstrate that they exercised appropriate surveillance on foreign planes that cross Spain&quot;.
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe in which it accused a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in practices contrary to human rights, a meeting took place between the former US ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la vega.
The vice-president acknowledged that the Council&#39;s report &quot;had caught the Zapatero government out of the game&quot; and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
&quot;De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objections to intelligence flights through Spanish territory.&quot;
&quot;They simply want to be informed&quot; to avoid being &quot;caught off guard,&quot; Aguirre recounted in a cable.
The then Minister of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive &quot;wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity for influence.&quot;
For his part, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he would not try to block the judge&#39;s initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on the flights of the INC.
&quot;These reports do not contain any incriminating elements or any sensitive information,&quot; the Embassy explained after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the US reflected its concern over the &quot;apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors&quot;, rather than the declassified information from the CNI or the Defense Ministry.
&quot;This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments,&quot; laments Aguirre.
In March 2007, at a lunch between the US ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter told him that &quot;although the Spanish judges are rabidly jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate&quot;, he had given instructions to his collaborators &quot;to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature&quot;.
The ambassador also expresses his concern about the performance of the PP in this matter.
&quot;Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the US government,&quot; he says.
The confessed parricide complained online about the &quot;overwhelm&quot; of being a mother
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and had a blog: &quot;Terror a la gallega&quot;
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is &quot;Muki&quot; in the network.
With this nickname, which she has used since she was little, she communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; the two natives of Noia, the Coruña town where she is from.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC reconstructs through testimonials from their relatives.
The 30-year-old Galician girl began a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left him, it was soon learned that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him take a DNA test.
It didn&#39;t take long for him to find out about another courtship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
He came to live with him for a long period.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to explore the job market, the little boy stayed with his partner, who even came to Palma for a week with her.
But from the content of the communications, it can be seen that their romance was fractured, that they broke up.
In March 2008 she is in Menorca, alone, and writes: &quot;Alberto is very strange and upset, because I have come to work.&quot;
&quot;When I told him it seemed fine, but of course, now he realizes what it&#39;s like to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do whatever he wants.&quot;
Then, he talks about a message on his cell phone that he has just received: &quot;I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send the child to you.&quot;
She complains: &quot;If you don&#39;t like me leaving the child with my mother, I&#39;ll pick him up when I get back,&quot; she alleges.
In May, he talks about returning to his town: &quot;This week I&#39;m going there, but I&#39;ll only be there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to show up for a job so I don&#39;t lose it.&quot;
He clarifies that if everything goes well, he takes his firstborn.
&quot;He&#39;s going to be with who he should be, that is, with me, and never in my life will it occur to me to leave him again with anyone other than my mother&quot;, a doubtful intention given his bad relationships.
In July, there is another post.
When you type it in, the boy, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was supposedly killed on the 10th, is supposed to be dead.
&quot;César is happy on one side, but not on the other.&quot;
&quot;On the one hand, he is with me and he likes the place a bit, but on the other, he is going to class almost every day.&quot;
He talks about a transfer to Majorca.
&quot;He (the boy) will go there for summer classes, and that way I save some money from the babysitter.&quot;
The 17th, memories and complaints.
&quot;A big kiss from César, who asks me when you come.&quot;
&quot;Alberto says that he sent you I don&#39;t know what videos to the email, look how he finds me when he wants to, you have to screw yourself.&quot;
On the 30th, another: &quot;The boy is fine, he is going to summer classes to learn Catalan.&quot;
From Víctor, his current partner, there is one: &quot;He advances me money.&quot;
On the internet there are messages of his in blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
She even had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now hijacked, where she called herself &quot;Muki the Released Woman.&quot;
&quot;Galician-style terror (epigraph)&quot;.
The last man who lived with her, a security guard, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
She doesn&#39;t want to believe that everything happened because she didn&#39;t tell him that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the Palma provincial penitentiary yesterday, from the Menorca judicial detainee center.
The public defender, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the events happened, &quot;nor having had the intention of causing any harm to the minor.&quot;
Before, he did confess that he had drowned César in the bathtub and deposited his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
The popular would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies experienced in the recent regional elections, the Catalan PP already has its sights set on the general elections because, whether there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation obtains in those elections it usually doubles the amount it receives in the Catalan ones.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 general elections, while in the 2006 regional elections, the figure rose to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC obtained 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend continues, which has been nourished by a transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 deputies (it has 25).
These calculations would confirm that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular, ERC would lose a deputy - now it has three - while ICV would keep one deputy or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will take place in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular ones can also be decisive in the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in his replacement at the head of the Barcelona Provincial Council, one of the administrations with the largest budget - 661 million euros for 2011 -.
Both nationalists and popularists agree on the possibility of the PSC losing the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not obtain a majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be unreasonable for this formation to lose its representation in the Barcelona City Council - it needs to obtain 5% of the votes -.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can lead the turnaround in the Tarragona capital, where they governed with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has only 500 votes behind the PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
The popular ones have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of towns.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaida
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian detained by agents of the General Police Information Station in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, provided passports to different groups of Al Qaeda, among them &quot;The Tigers for the Liberation of the Earth Tamil&quot; (LTTE) and &quot;Laskar e Taiba&quot; (Let), the latter author of the Bombay attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of assuring that with the &quot;Kampai operation&quot; the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaida at the international level has been &quot;weakened&quot; and, &quot;therefore, its operational capacity&quot;.
The researchers calculate that the cell, in the two years that it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then distributed to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that their &quot;combatants&quot; can cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operating in Europe, which is why, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units have participated in the investigations, so it is not ruled out that in EU territory they take carried out in the next few days blows similar to the one developed last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another was carried out in Thailand with the capture of the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones who ran the cell based in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports from tourists that met the requirements set by the so-called &quot;World Islamic Front&quot;.
In other words, the documents had to be in the name of men between the ages of 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
In the investigation media it is emphasized that, for the moment, no data has been found linking those arrested in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, despite the fact that the perpetrator of this attack, &quot;Laskar e Taiba&quot;, was one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, about a thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia through a transfer agency that were &quot;invested&quot; in the purchase of mobile cards that were later used by the members of the &quot; commando&quot; that killed 106 people.
The Police have seized abundant documentation.
The PP demands Mas to park the fiscal concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally explain to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and which are summarized in prioritizing the recovery of the economy and dispense with pro-sovereignty adventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to propose in the middle of his term.
The president of the popular Catalans attended the meeting with Artur Mas with the certainty that comes from having obtained 18 deputies in last Sunday&#39;s elections, a figure more than enough to endear himself, since the CiU candidate needs at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition to abstain in the investiture vote.
The future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held depend on a possible entente with the PP, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas is holding these days with the rest of the political leaders are carried out in a Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an investiture &quot;it will be necessary to put aside all the sovereignist and pro-independence discourses&quot;, as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader even intends to submit to a referendum.
Both leaders do have in common their commitment to slim down the political apparatus of a highly inflated regional administration and the elimination of the inheritance and gift tax.
Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat will take care of the details of the negotiation on the investiture of Mas, on behalf of the PPC.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition -, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home affirms that the deaths were not due to &quot;lack of measures&quot;
The owners of the Olot center do not rule out that their guard killed more than 11 elderly people
The people in charge of the nursing home La Caritat de Olot (Girona) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage that the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé has caused to the institution, the nurse who while he was employed there killed at least eleven elders under his charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the center&#39;s lawyer, the lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that &quot;La Caritat&#39;s wish would be to be able to bring charges against the person responsible&quot; for the deaths but &quot;legality and responsibility oblige to assume the procedural situation of civil responsible&quot;.
And it is that in addition to the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not having detected the criminal activities of the guard in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the victims&#39; relatives are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge already noted in the order ordering the exhumation of eight bodies - former nursing home patients - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally examined the deceased but, based on the age and pathologies of the patients, dispatched the procedure by phone.
La Caritat, through its director, flatly denied this point yesterday and pointed out that &quot;the lack of measures cannot have been at any time the cause of what has happened.&quot;
The lawyer for La Caritat added that &quot;in the case there is not a single indication that there has been a reckless action by anyone other than the defendant himself.&quot;
The already baptized &quot;Angel of Death&quot; confessed to 11 murders the day before yesterday and explained that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 to kill a second grandmother a month and a half later.
In this case, he caused death by puncturing an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime that was committed with the help of a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the center&#39;s staff have access to medicines.
The insulin injections and the sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the analyzes that are being carried out in the laboratory that will have to clarify if Vila is not lying and sought a less cruel death for his first victims or if, on the contrary, he burned them from the inside by giving them bleach as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the statements of the guard, not even to the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out that it is higher, and they justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his ways after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say that they are making themselves available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet&#39;s threat yesterday that he warned &quot;the markets should not underestimate our ability to react.&quot;
Peripheral spreads have closed strong and shares of European banks are up more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the ECB&#39;s ability to err either and the euro has barely rallied which is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that recovers just as it collapses, but motivated by closing short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will take time to lose fear.
A month ago the ECB summoned us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to be retracted tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
The Bundesbank demanded to end the public debt purchase plan as ineffective and eliminate all extraordinary measures of term liquidity, leaving only unlimited access per week.
Following the Irish crisis we expect them to extend current liquidity measures &quot;at least until March&quot; and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also expect them to continue their bond-buying program and even signal to step it up.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, God help us!
Just like their May meeting where they claimed they hadn&#39;t even contemplated buying bonds and the markets crashed, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and on Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the one-year bill auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million at 5.28%, versus 750 million at 4.81% in the previous auction.
Even so, rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the entire curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet&#39;s words.
In Ireland, the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole figures have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10,000 million in the short term and another 15,000 potential and they have until February to get private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland does not have any credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress tests, the figures are acceptable within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and it still does not have enough support, so Ireland continues to be a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to relax the tension ahead of the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14, in which a political commitment is necessary to show that we are a union and that we all play the same music sheet.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest Beethoven&#39;s hymn of joy.
In Spain, the president had the gift of opportunity when presenting yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors like Vivaldi&#39;s four seasons.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains why the Spanish stock market has risen 4.5%, double that of the rest of the European stock markets.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction for a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope it will be met with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain, requesting an Aid Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in available liquidity, triple that of March, at very expensive rates and it closes your access to the markets sine die.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar&#39;s wife, &quot;in addition to being so, appear to be so.&quot;
Cheer up, we can.
The president of Eulen will challenge the board of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The storm does not abate in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, considering it &quot;null and void&quot;, the judicial meeting of El Enebro on the next 16th, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of the firm that owns Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their dispute over control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company for business services does not seem willing to give up in his dispute to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
He was removed from his board of directors by five of his seven children who were appointed administrators at the shareholders&#39; meeting on January 18 of this year and whose challenge is recorded in the Mercantile Registry.
The judicial meeting of El Enebro for the next day 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, has once again opened the box of thunder within the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to set the meeting is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the meeting.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Álvarez as a &quot;desperate resource of the applicants, their five children, to, through procedural trickery, in clear fraud of the Law and abuse of rights, treat to validate and clean up the radically null meeting of January 18&quot;, according to their official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for, once the meeting is held, to proceed to challenge it, considering that it is &quot;null and void&quot;.
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already unsuccessfully tried to get the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a holding company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group claims, however, the usufruct of 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This issue is the substantive issue that the judge must decide once the hearing on the challenge claim is held, for which there is still no set date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software designs improvements in the cars in real time.
Since Red Bull burst into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into consideration the options of a newly arrived team and, despite the upward trajectory of recent seasons, last November, in the final stretch of the championship, everyone bet on the triumph of Fernando Alonso&#39;s Ferrari.
Without detracting from the skill as a driver of the final champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor from the capacity of the Renault engine that powers his car, in the world of Formula 1 the &quot;secret weapon&quot; that the multinational Siemens has become a legend. has put in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German put on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from high-end automotive competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computing tool has been used to design assembly lines for manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to faithfully reproduce and simulate the product or process before building it in real life, thus avoiding failures and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan&#39;s most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and carry out &quot;in a few hours, almost in real time&quot;, the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during the races and in the tests.
Russwurm explains that the teams in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were capable of introducing a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during each season.
Today, 180 highly qualified young professionals work in the Red Bull team who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all sorts of modifications to the cars.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all the elements of Red Bull cars with the exception of the engine, which is the sole responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be brought from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limitation of this madness of technological improvement is the figure of 40 million dollars that each Formula 1 team can spend at most each season to facilitate the competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its racing cars in a town about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings in which visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered &quot;top secret&quot;.
The staff for this task amounts to 580 people, including its two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull&#39;s Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, other protagonists hide whose help is invaluable and whose notoriety is null.
The factory&#39;s head of technology, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R&amp;D advances in cart cars contributed 50% of victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and technology accounts for 85% of the success, while the pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing since &quot;they are unpredictable gladiators.&quot;
HP will install 20 own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened yesterday in Barcelona its first exclusive store in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will make this initiative compatible with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the remodeled store located on Barcelona&#39;s Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has collaborated for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 branded points of sale in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems also assured that the philosophy to install the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and is in charge of the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be touched interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of store personnel.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops aims to &quot;improve customer service and SMEs in purchasing, customer service, after-sales and even packaging&quot;.
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering pilot program worldwide that is responsible for solving possible problems with HP computer equipment under warranty.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
&quot;Thus, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days.&quot;
&quot;This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, since large companies already have contracted technical assistance services,&quot; Helena Herrero remarked yesterday.
Sabadell bets on &#39;stealing&#39; a million customers from its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, the CEO of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for banks, but initially rules out a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse in interest margins, which they will try to partially compensate with increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years, its pending issue.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very difficult economic environment.
The bank will launch a new master plan in 2011 that will be valid for three years.
The objective, in addition to surviving without the need to resort to public aid from the FROB, is to gain market share by attracting one million new individual customers -700,000 if those who can leave the bank are discounted-, his great pending issue, since until now it had pampered SMEs and companies more than the retail client.
This year it has attracted 250,000 individual customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when it presents the results of the year.
Few banks dare these days to set goals and make them public, since the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of world banks.
Sabadell, in fact, will close its Optima master plan this year, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the market situation meant that it will extend it for one more year.
Customers who let savings banks escape will be their main target.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 is going to be a &quot;difficult and transcendental&quot; year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the way out of the crisis in Spain &quot;will be slow.&quot;
In addition, in two or three years it will be &quot;very difficult to create jobs&quot;, something essential for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, although he believes that the liability war - which penalizes margins - is falling, the price of the risk premiums that banks and savings banks are paying for their issues to obtain liquidity are already being transferred to the price of credit to compensate for the fall from the margins.
&quot;The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it is going to be a factor of pressure on credit.&quot;
&quot;We have not closed the tap, but the differentials are higher,&quot; Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto already gave orders to its network on Thursday to limit long-term credit and raise the price of spreads -see CincoDías on November 22 and 27-.
He also acknowledged that the banking trend now &quot;is to raise commissions&quot;, but &quot;there is a competitive framework&quot;.
Sabadell&#39;s master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not surprisingly, he assures that in Spain &quot;larger sizes will be required.&quot;
&quot;Next year everything is going to move,&quot; he said.
He affirms that the capital needs are &quot;increased a lot&quot; and does not rule out that some Spanish financial entity enters into the red.
And he points out that the FROB can replace the market in raising funds before new recapitalizations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, he downplayed what some bankers are already predicting as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repos, which cushions the crisis.
CECA rules out a second wave of mergers in savings banks
The director general of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that there is going to be a wave of mergers of savings banks and once again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would reserve themselves for the second round.
However, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations is going to take place.
&quot;I think that most of the mergers have been done, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be said to be a second round, what there are are adjustments.&quot;
&quot;Most of it is completely done; instead of 17 we may go to 13 or 14 but all the major processes have already been done and supervised by the Bank of Spain, which has also collaborated a lot in that,&quot; said the manager.
In declarations during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has explained that the concentration process is being undertaken &quot;at the highest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is taking place within the deadlines that in their day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain&quot;, he emphasized.
&quot;Going from 45 savings banks with an average of 28,500 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to comply with Basel &quot;, he highlighted.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that &quot;there are a series of rather unfortunate opinions about the slowness of the process&quot; that demonstrate &quot;a lack of seriousness and sense&quot;, because &quot;what the Bank of Spain does is remember that we have to be within the deadline before end of the year&quot;.
The general director of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and &quot;probably&quot; in the world, and attributed to those who question it a &quot;lack of knowledge&quot;.
The manager pointed out that, within the current economic situation, &quot;we can be very calm&quot; with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a &quot;very important&quot; concentration process and that &quot;is going to fastest possible speed.
He also recalled that Spanish banks did very well in the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoemaker and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has set the conditions for the entire Union.
The tensions in the markets have provoked a double governmental response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private employment agencies or suppression of the 426 euros of aid for the unemployed without benefit, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, of the management of the Barajas and El Prat airports and of 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
Go ahead, Merkel&#39;s position is not an error in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another twist in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with maintaining the old traditions of a large part of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, speculation in Germany begins about the three possible solutions to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now it seems like science fiction, with a current of very favorable opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines for transgressing countries, possible suspension of payments by some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German government came up with a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (fiscal rigor plans and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the forehead was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully dragged out the decision to rescue Greece.
Even then it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public and published opinion were very much against the bailout of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the treaties of the Union, to make it possible to rescue a country and, at the same time, force private lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, since it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should attend the reform process of the Union that will make those measures possible as of 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, although measures must now be taken with which he perhaps does not quite agree, from that date the old functioning of the euro will have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new currency area, in which offending countries will be severely penalized, may be forced to declare bankruptcy and, in this case, the private sector will also bear part of the cost.
Germany is telling us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, like the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, they simply will not tolerate.
The challenge is clear.
And we would do wrong not to understand it.
It is not just about bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What they demand of us is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is fool ourselves.
I hope that the current turmoil will give way to greater calm.
And that we take advantage of the window of opportunity that we have been given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood it this way and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday&#39;s meeting with the big companies and yesterday&#39;s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel, he has opened up I walk the thesis that you have to put order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it does not seem that they are going to move it.
And, among the possibilities that are contemplated, that of abandoning a currency zone that is too crowded with countries that are not very serious, cannot be excluded.
Then, Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.
Sport and law fraud
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show ingenuity but not the will to escape a sanction.
The expulsion allegedly engineered by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match played on November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about whether or not such behavior is unsportsmanlike and if, eventually, both players had to be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, with a few minutes to go in the game (which their team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately wasted time drawing free kicks to provoke the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will end up as the leader of their group, both players will serve the regulatory sanction in the next league game, against Auxerre, and will be able to advance to the next phase with no cards.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has penalized the team&#39;s coach, José Mourinho, with two games and different financial amounts for the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the reported case is due to the fact that it has been carried out by a team from the entity of Real Madrid (which in its anthem boasts of nobility and honor, and which on past occasions has fined its players for similar acts) and the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds another episode to his long history as a histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behavior not expressly prohibited by the regulations contradicts the principles of sport, that is, if these actions commit legal fraud; Well, in effect, they are actions that respect the sports regulations, but they seem to elude their meaning.
The question goes through examining the type of damage they cause to the sportsmanship.
One of the assets that sportsmanship includes is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these goods that is alluded to with fair play is to prevent the team of the offending players from taking unfair advantage of the opposing team, which did not happen either.
Now, the paradoxical thing about the action of the Real Madrid players is that it did not conform to what we normally characterize as cheating or legal fraud, since their violation of the rules was not done secretly to try to avoid sanction, but rather that precisely his action tried to be the most obvious in order to receive the punishment of the referee.
They expected and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another issue is what kind of advantage offenders gain in the intentional fouls examined.
Here it seems necessary to verify that the rival is not placed in a disadvantageous situation or benefit is obtained in the same game, since obviously the result of the action means leaving the team with fewer players.
And it is not a useful strategy for the next game either, since the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously, is that the players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But it is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, since the team can be eliminated at the first change, and also with this action the players serve a one-match ban and go to the second cycle of cards, in in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, going through rounds, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the sporting spirit, which is part of making strategic decisions that favor getting the most out of what the rules allow.
In the case at hand, the players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (this would indeed be a clear case of legal fraud), but rather they chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding punishment or running away from it.
Although the line between ingenuity and legal fraud is blurred, on this occasion I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises from two factors: because it involved two self-expulsions and the way in which the directive to provoke them was transmitted.
The damage caused to the principles of the sport by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Bid offensive to attract group Christmas dinners in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th.
Self-supported celebrations by employees proliferate, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the nougat and the lottery, with the arrival of December the pre-Christmas group dinners also return, which continue to act as an oxygen balloon for restaurants and leisure in Barcelona, but which, due to the crisis, have led to an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all of them want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or lunches, agree the businessmen and associations of the sector interviewed.
To finish complicating the accounting, this year&#39;s calendar (with New Year&#39;s Eve falling on a Friday) has concentrated requests in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 16 and 17) and hardly movement for the previous week.
As has been happening since 2008, when the lean days began, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to dispense with the tradition, many workers maintain it by paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, both demand competitive prices, confirms the president of the Barcelona Restoration Association, Gaietà Farràs.
The employer&#39;s representative, to this day, does not dare to predict what the festivities will be like this month.
&quot;People think long before booking.&quot;
&quot;He wants to go out but he has the alerts on the issue of prices,&quot; he says.
The business will go well &quot;to those who provide quality at a good price and with good service,&quot; he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down one step with the crisis, so that the range around 25 euros has become majority in demand.
In a survey in various downtown establishments, the collapse of requests for the night of the 17th is confirmed.
In the Soteras group, they indicate that there is a real boom in requests for that Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more advance booking, even since the beginning of November.
&quot;We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices as last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros,&quot; they detail.
At AN Grup, which is led by El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 stores, they remain optimistic after detecting a billing boom since the second semester and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group point out that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day for groups of friends who are pre-celebrating the holidays.
They have added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with 30 euros or more as the star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green shoots in some companies that invite their employees back and a feeling that the volume of the groups is somewhat higher.
On behalf of the Fecasarm employers&#39; association (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, is confident that he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that overall reservations are &quot;encouraged&quot;, although clients &quot;bargain to the max&quot;.
Of course, the illusion for the festivities has not decreased, whoever pays pays, he indicates.
The Pakistani nuclear program causes great concern in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons &quot;at a faster rate than any other country.&quot;
Wikileaks leaks confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program causes in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details that they offer about the content of the conversations and the thoughts of the American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that the cooperation between the two countries in terms of atomic security, instead of increasing, &quot;decreases&quot;, and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons &quot;at a faster rate than any other country in the world&quot;.
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled but rather are stored by components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - constitutes one of the main reasons for Washington&#39;s sleeplessness.
This is how the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists it in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security adviser, James Jones: &quot;The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of transporting atomic materials&quot;.
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is seen, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to keep our guard up.
&quot;Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the drop in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work on nuclear or missile programs,&quot; said the expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his American counterparts.
The latest in the documentation leaked through Julian Assange&#39;s website is the diminishing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and Pakistan&#39;s high rate of production of nuclear weapons.
Calling communication with Pakistan &quot;frustrating,&quot; an embassy dispatch in May said: &quot;Transparency is often non-existent; offers of help go unanswered or dismissed.&quot;
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that &quot;despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.&quot;
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the head of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it &quot;very clear&quot; to the person in charge that &quot;the Pakistan Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups.&quot;
On the hunt for the Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a senior person in charge of the fight against terrorism to prevent new leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to follow the movements and locate Assange where he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a &quot;red alert&quot; to &quot;locate and follow the movements&quot; of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, it is not new, but dates from November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents but with the sexual abuse allegations the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer for the creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures that &quot;the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.&quot;
It was on the 20th when the international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol have instructions to identify or locate Assange &quot;with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition.&quot;
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as explained by the organization, do consider the so-called red notice a free way to proceed with an arrest -- which must be carried out by the national body police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange&#39;s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks has shown himself willing to answer questions from the Swedish authorities by videoconference.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor in his case, whom they compare to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin&#39;s security chief.
&quot;This looks like a hunt, not a legal pursuit,&quot; denounces the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends her son&#39;s innocence - Assange remains unaccounted for, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the director of Time magazine via Skype from an undetermined location, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
&quot;If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering US diplomats to spy on the UN in violation of international treaties the US has signed, he should resign,&quot; he said.
His opinion was reviled yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who described the resignation request as &quot;ridiculous and absurd&quot;.
&quot;I&#39;m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,&quot; he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior person in charge of the fight against terrorism, Russell Travers, to prevent new document leaks.
President Barack Obama&#39;s spokesman&#39;s attempt to downplay Assange stands in stark contrast to views being hawked these days by conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who from January will chair the Homeland Security Committee in the lower house, has asked the State Department to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations &quot;to intervene and their funds and persecute anyone who gives them any contribution or help&quot;.
Further still has gone Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to retract after saying Assange should &quot;be assassinated.&quot;
&quot;Obama should target it and use a drone or something.&quot;
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
&quot;Whoever in government leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything short of execution would be too kind a punishment,&quot; he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with nods to those related to Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to overcome the umpteenth internal revolt in the ranks of the ERC, without direction due to the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his threat of resignation is insufficient for those close to former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that it cannot cause him any harm at all. headaches that he had with other extinct currents.
For this reason, the leader of Esquerra will try to win over the new critics with winks that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national ERC councilors will be able to rule on its continuity in secret.
Through ballots, and not by show of hands.
If the Cardistas want to convey a certain vote of punishment to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In various interviews, he stated that half plus one of the votes would not be considered ratified, but added, without specifying percentages, that a &quot;Bulgarian&quot; result would not be good either.
Those close to Carod demand something more from the president than making his position available to the militancy, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the highest body between congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they are going to try to agree with the executive a road map between now and May.
To do this, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to a vote by the national council on the 18th.
His intention is to endorse Puigcercós in exchange for him promising to bring the congress forward to autumn 2011, something that the leadership already takes for granted.
The ERC leader acknowledged that &quot;polyphony&quot; harms stability and that his goal is to make the organization capable of washing dirty laundry from door to door once and for all.
In this line, the article that the acting Minister Josep Huguet signed on his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the head of Innovation assumed that the leader will be endorsed &quot;in exchange for various objectives.&quot;
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first, &quot;recompose&quot; the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is, to include new faces that come from the sector related to Carod.
The second may be the big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC once and for all liquidate the assembly as an operating mechanism.
Thus, he advocates a reform of the statutes that allows congresses to be held through delegates elected by vote.
Putting an end to the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive conclave of 2008 left the mandate to the management to review the assembly in a specific congress to reform the statutes.
This appointment is still pending, since the internal tide of recent years made it inadvisable to face the matter.
Now, with no critical sectors lurking around, it may be a good time to retake it and try to shut it down for good.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the MILENIO Estado de México count, there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to the content of MILENIO Estado de México.
Among the murders, those of three women and the discovery of a couple of severed bodies in the Valley of Mexico stand out.
In the penultimate month of the year there were 390 deaths allegedly related to organized crime.
Among the cases, the one of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca, stands out.
The subject had at least three shots from a firearm and the coup de grace to the head, as well as his feet and hands tied with a cable.
The following day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas street, in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the municipality of Naucalpan.
In the early hours of Thursday the fourth, ejidatarios found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots to the chest, on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal toll highway, in the section that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body was found a message allegedly signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualcóyotl, a 50-year-old man was killed with eight bullets after leaving his house to start collecting garbage.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by a bullet wound to the head each in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc neighborhood, Ecatepec municipality.

China upholds greenhouse gas reduction targets
The representative of that country at COP16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and explained that it supports its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 between 40 and 45 percent.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country&#39;s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and reconvert its industry.
In fact, he explained, in the last four years his country has invested 245 million dollars in efforts to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community on this matter.
He said that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; building institutions and supporting pilot programs.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including the approval, last year, of a new Energy Law, which includes the objectives set in terms of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he highlighted that in China, the federal authorities have been working in coordination with the state and local authorities, to achieve the objectives of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, he added, various multi-year plans are underway or have already been completed, both financed by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries.
For example, he referred, the Efficient Energy Use Program, which was implemented during the last five years and which received investments from the United Nations Organization (UN), the government and the private sector.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for the change of incandescent bulbs for savers and one more for mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific adviser to the government of that country on climate change, assured that China&#39;s efforts have been greater than what is generally thought.
For example, he explained, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution in pollution.
Likewise, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent in the last five years and plans to do the same by 2020, he added.
Attached to the legality of the expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN explained that the former PAN leader has the right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is right for him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to the law and that the former PAN leader has the right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is right for him.
In an interview prior to the swearing in of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as state governor, he said that in any case, Espino&#39;s expulsion is a decision taken at the local level.
&quot;This is an autonomous decision of the Order Commission of Sonora.&quot;
&quot;Mr. Espino has the right to go, where appropriate, via a claim to the Order Commission of the National Council, in such a way that it is a decision made within the scope of a competent body,&quot; he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for the presidential candidacy was never on the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Acción Nacional will emerge stronger from the internal election on December 4 and 5, when his successor will be elected.
&quot;That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never on the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was a proposal for the local election that was successful and achieved its objective,&quot; he said.
The PAN leader specified that the PAN is backed by 71 years of dialogue, so &quot;internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, &quot;we enjoy it and it strengthens us,&quot; he said.
He said that without a doubt the council will know how to choose the best leader required by National Action for the next three years, hence it will hand over the post &quot;to whomever the council determines.&quot;
&quot;I have that absolute calm and openness, to any of the five I would be proud to hand over the office of party president.&quot;
He predicted that the rebound registered by the party in the last elections on July 4 will be reflected in the next contests, although &quot;it is not yet time to think about 2012.&quot;
&quot;For now it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task.&quot;
Within this framework, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be the reason for observation throughout the country, hence &quot;many hopes and desires are placed on them, and I am sure that Gabino will be live up to expectations.&quot;
When questioned about the PRI&#39;s criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech in the framework of the four years of his government, César Nava called on the PRI members to reflect on the six-year terms of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
&quot;If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, let them start defending them; let them come out of the closet,&quot; he said.
He opined that the head of the federal Executive can make expressions like the ones he did in his speech at the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gag, much less censorship.
Obama promotes on Twitter law in favor of undocumented students
&quot;If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,&quot; the US president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal account on the social network Twitter.
&quot;If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,&quot; Obama tweeted.
His short message holds open a web link to a larger document asking the public to contact senators immediately as a vote on the legislation is imminent.
&quot;With a vote expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard,&quot; he says.
The message was released after all 42 Republican senators threatened to block a vote on any legislation unless the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding is approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs trusted that once the tax issue was resolved, a schedule could be set for the rest of the projects.
&quot;I think there&#39;s plenty of time...&quot;
&quot;We all agree that we have to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year...&quot;
&quot;I think we can get a deal done at some point on that and then we can sequence the rest,&quot; he said.
The leader of the Democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday that he would ask for a &quot;vote of closure of the debate&quot; for the Dream Act law, by which the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on starting next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or American Dream law would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the last five years, and entered an institution of higher education or the military.
But supporters need 60 votes to pass the initiative, which requires a handful of Republicans to compete, at a time when organizations supporting the project are lobbying intensely to guarantee the law&#39;s approval.
Democrats, a majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Yet at least one of them, Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against it, and only one Republican has expressed support for the bill, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
For this reason, supporters of the Dream Act need to add several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Maine Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Sen. George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of Sen. Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have said they will not support it another time.
Another Republican he supported, John McCain, has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the sore
The second round of The pleasures of the language was a walk where the participants showed off the storytelling
&quot;I understand that about Sex in the Language, but... my finger on the sore? What is expected of me?&quot; asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, invited to open the second round of The pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this time he used the subtitle of his question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, he explained).
Her finger on the sore... &quot;it puts us in trouble,&quot; the Argentine writer sweetly blurted out to the audience, mostly young people, who gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who, in search of knowing what the &quot;sore&quot; is, goes from doctor to doctor, one of those who does not he gets answers although he does get clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist she leaves convinced: &quot;patience is not my forte, maybe it is my sore&quot;.
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who clarifies that sore is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: &quot;the sore is the open real, the symbolic is the scar.&quot;
The protagonist sighed with relief and concluded &quot;from the sore I only managed to know that it is the open real and that it does not exist&quot;, but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very intertwined.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narration that he titled In Praise of Invention, where the finger on the sore is not named but in a moment it is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, it tells of a famous sorceress, who touched the clouds, brought back men who had gone far away, or repaired the virtues that a maiden had lost, a narrative that turned to speak later America, the great novel to the one that its own chroniclers did not lack from the beginning to tell it and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of what was told by the conquering captains.
&quot;Cervantes, who invented us all (the writers), made fun of the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told with imagination, which was lacking even modesty. &quot;.
However, he highlighted &quot;the madmen and liars are the ones who best imagine&quot; and it is where reality and lies converge, where it is no longer known which of what is narrated belongs to one side or the other, where fiction literature reaches its apogee.
In fact, he calls it the &#39;Cervantine tradition&#39;.
&quot;By his inheritance we are what is counted&quot;.
In her turn, the writer Mayra Montero delimited and applauded the variety of interpretations that the FIL invitation gave rise to with her round table El dedo en la llaga.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed hers towards the great sore of social violence that her country is going through -and shares Latin America- as a result of disputes over drug trafficking and sale.
&quot;I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditated,&quot; he said, after citing that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and readers, and that in a &quot;chemical reaction&quot; of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose speech also emphasized &quot;that finger on the wound of the committed writer of the writer.&quot;
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatism, forgetting &quot;that behind each affirmation there is a small no and behind each denial there is a small yes&quot;.
&quot;To be masters of our thinking and to be masters of reality, we have to qualify: and qualifying often means putting a finger on the sore spot and bothering those people who are much more comfortable thinking in caricatures, in black and white, in established ideas. and without nuance and also disturb the powers that prefer a world in black and white&quot;, he said, inviting to recover the meaning of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their coaches, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to reach the decisive series three times, although until now he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine ended up consoling himself with the runner-up medal, falling one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he has played consecutive finals.
The Santiago strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he was in charge of Morelia, with which he lost 4-2 on aggregate against Toluca; later, in the Clausura 2003, he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with a 3-1 aggregate and it was precisely against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén again suffered a setback, since his team finished tied 2-2 against the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shootout he put himself in lead 3-1 with two chances to seal the title to finally three of his players failed from 11 steps and suffered the somersault 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his current rival, therefore he does not want to suffer the same fate, he seeks to get rid of the curse and be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that for him the most important thing is is the institution.
&quot;I want to be champion, I don&#39;t want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe myself and consequently the title will come for me, but the above is the most important thing&quot;, commented the helmsman when He questioned him about the numbers he has against playing finals.
The previous final is very current, from which, he assures, he has learned a lot, &quot;the only lesson we can have is that until the referee whistles the final we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the the previous time, with two penalties to be taken, we were already prepared to run away and I think that this is a lesson, until the game is over we can celebrate&quot;.
Knowing that this series could be defined in penalty kicks, something that does not worry him, since he trusts his players: &quot;You never seek to reach the penalty shootout, you seek to finish in regulation time, but sometimes there is no other way and you have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately fate played a trick on us, sometimes due to nerves or the anxiety of having the title in our hands, but it left us, that left us something for this final that we hope will not get to that point.&quot;
Romano has in his hands to stop being a runner-up coach and try for the first time the glory that titles give.
EU changes rules to obtain visa
People must go to the Visa Applicant Service centers before their interview at the Consular Section; the cost will be less and as well as the waiting time.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedure for processing a visa at the United States Embassy and consulates will change.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to the Visa Applicant Service (ASC) centers before their interview at the Consular Section.
ASC staff will collect the applicant&#39;s biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, among which are:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to make the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another one for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current fee will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for petition visas (including temporary worker visas), and $390 for trader and investor visas.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to attend an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and have their fingerprints taken.
Because the biometric information will be taken at the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed at the Consular Section will stay there for less time than in the past.
Likewise, those who request a visa at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of 26 dollars.

NASA to announce discovery of extraterrestrial life
The US space agency summoned the press to present tomorrow a finding that will cause an impact in the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life does exist.
The finding will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science described as the one in charge of studying the origin, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the Universe.
Citing the press, NASA assured that it will present &quot;a finding that will cause an impact in the search for extraterrestrial life&quot;, which aroused speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that creatures exist on a par with us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility that they could become intelligent beings like humans if the conditions in which they live improve.
Apparently it is a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and this ability raises the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be demonstrated that &quot;there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know.&quot;
The space agency will announce the true scope of the findings at a press conference tomorrow Thursday.
The geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars, will participate in the conference; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn&#39;s largest moon) from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to Earth&#39;s.
Deed PRD, PT, Convergence and Opposition &#39;bloc&#39; Patron
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of &#39;bipartisanship&#39;, they denounce.
The 60th Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, headed by the representatives of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of &#39;bipartisanship&#39; in the camera.
Before beginning the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, &#39;thundered&#39; against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, the &quot;bipartisanship&quot; begins, because now there will be two people, from the same number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by PAN member Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo, explained that with these institutional reforms the political marginality of the PRI and PAN is constituted.
He explained that in the next few days they will talk with the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, based on a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be overwhelmed again by both parties and with this the opposition coalition is over.
&quot;This is as far as (the opposition coalition) has come, that&#39;s what I see, because we are excluded from any decision, they don&#39;t even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.&quot;
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patrón, there are coincidences and that is why they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, after having been monopolistic, is now &quot;duopolic.&quot;
&quot;It is not in the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipatidism in Congress.&quot;
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking with other compañeros and compañeras so that they are more, the convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from the PT, explained that Congress has now become a &quot;loot&quot; between two, alluding to the PAN and PRI.
&quot;Before it was just one game, now they are dividing it up between two.&quot;
Patrón Montalvo, asked that the personality of the deputy be respected, that he be given his place at the negotiating tables.
&quot;That not because of agreements from the leadership, 5 that we are probably going to make 9 deputies are left out, right now the five that see us, separated into different fractions, have decided to unify to find a place at the negotiating table, that is the I was afraid that in the reform that they made that they agreed to, we are out and we do not agree with that reform&quot;.
$200 thousand more comes out for &quot;the supplier&quot;
Mazatlán City Hall pays another check to the questioned owner of an electrical material company.
One more check for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second semester to the owner of the electrical material company, amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the Municipality&#39;s transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of &quot;settlement of accounts payable.&quot;
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had anticipated that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the Superior State Audit Office for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still owed to him and, consequently, how many more checks remain to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
&quot;Nothing has been bought, you are just being paid what is owed, just like the rest of the vendors,&quot; he said in an interview.
The last checks &quot;reappeared&quot; in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two from October 15, October 19, October 29 and the latter, from November 16.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official State Gazette, as required by law when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using their services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used their services again. services.
The foregoing, after the July 25, Noroeste published a review of the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos was paid by the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where he cashed checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgent to attend tourist sites
Tourist businessmen regret the accident of foreign tourists due to poor conditions at the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a collapse of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the Mazatlan tourism sector asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination is taken care of and reverse the bad things that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the disorder and they take away from nearby businesses.
&quot;Politicians don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to close a company one day and they have no idea of the money that is lost, or else they wouldn&#39;t do the works in this way in such a long time and without proper planning.&quot;
The hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
&quot;The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it by giving preventive maintenance and not falling only on the corrective,&quot; he said.
&quot;We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area it must be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well.&quot;
There are other sites that also look neglected and incomplete, he said, such as the Shield and the Venadito de Mazatlán.
&quot;Today, for the tourist to come, it does not depend solely on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance of what are the tourist attractions,&quot; he said.
&quot;Due attention has not been given and this type of event reveals something that is notorious to everyone, maintenance is needed.&quot;
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, expressed that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent, since they are not used correctly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that should be put online together with the municipality and be a priority to keep the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it is a tourist destination.
&quot;Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put on line to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory that we have to promote the destination.&quot;
IP asks Congress for results
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, proposed that the deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa due to the various challenges it faces.
A Legislature of dignified work and free of agreements between parties and the state Executive demands the business sector of Mazatlán, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday the 60th legislature was installed, made up of seven political forces, 19 deputies from the PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from Convergence and one more from the PVEM, which adds up to a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to carry out a clean management and commitment to society and with the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanship are not repeated. or paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the recently released 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa due to the various challenges it faces.
&quot;We hope that the deputies really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is customary that they make arrangements to look after their own interests and become carnival troupes of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary fractions.&quot;
Hence, he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that will move the Governor in turn forward.
&quot;We take care that they come to do a decent job and above all committed to society and to the sectors because it was the Sinaloans who gave them the vote of confidence in the last elections.&quot;
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the great challenges for the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of economic growth in the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
&quot;The most important thing is that they boost economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will somehow encourage job creation.&quot;
Regarding tourist activity, he demanded that the new legislators give it the weight it has within the state budget to strengthen the state Secretary of Tourism.
&quot;I understand that it is the second Ministry in the state with the lowest budget and it is incongruous as an important economic activity that generates foreign currency and investment and that directly competes with the agro-industry.&quot;
In addition to the fact that it is necessary to label resources for detonating tourism projects and that help provide security to the state and update the Alcohol Law that they have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
Wanted a wizard king
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For his parents, the next Three Kings Day will be difficult to satisfy their dreams, since their home is made up of no more and no less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live from day to day because the father does not have a permanent job.
&quot;Well, sometimes we find it hard because my husband doesn&#39;t have a job, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... in the afternoon I go out with the &#39;plebes&#39; to sell on the street,&quot; said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the children&#39;s mother.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, while her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a &#39;monster&#39; car and for his 8-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests clothing size for one year.
&quot;He (José Alfredo) told me, &#39;I would like this monster&#39;, but I told him &#39;let&#39;s see, son,&#39; because it was very expensive,&quot; Cayetana recalled sadly.
For older children, who were at school, clothing and footwear would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, is a size 12; Isaías, 10 years old, is a size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, wears a size 8.
José Juan, 14, lacks tennis shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can participate in the Wise Man Wanted campaign, donating a toy or cash at the Northwest reception.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen prosecutions were carried out within the framework of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of Cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The persecutions have taken place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the production of the drug was carried out.
&quot;About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and production equipment have been seized,&quot; said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for Quebec Security.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have occurred after a long investigation that has lasted nearly a year.
&quot;It has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to make the arrests,&quot; says Mr. Ruel.
Around seventy agents from the Quebec Security Estrie investigation module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
Clandestine migration can be fought without problems
The Conservatives&#39; bill, which the government says should solve the problem of small boats loaded with clandestine migrants, is likely to face strong opposition as all three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
&quot;I rely mainly on the Charter.&quot;
&quot;I am here with a party that has created the granite that you walk on,&quot; declared the Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone coming from a ship identified as carrying clandestine immigrants to be detained for up to a year, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Quebec Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe also indicated he could not support the bill because it hits the wrong target.
&quot;We are against it and, it seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government does,&quot; said Mr Duceppe.
NPD immigration critic Olivia Chow has struck down criticism that her party is not tough enough on illegal immigrants.
&quot;The neo-Democrats agree that measures should be taken against those in charge of the clandestine boats and that is what we want with another bill, the C-35&quot;, says Mrs. Chow.
&quot;We don&#39;t support the Conservatives&#39; bill because it targets refugees and imprisons children for a minimum of one year,&quot; explains Ms Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the parties in the position of playing politicians and disregarding the will of Canadians.
&quot;The vast majority of Canadians tell Members of Parliament that they do not tolerate this type of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country like a doormat.&quot;
&quot;They expect Canada to take strong action,&quot; says Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a confidence vote on its bill, which could lead the country to an election as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative has informed the QMI Agency that the Government was going to request the holding of a vote so that each deputy who is going to oppose can explain himself later to his constituents.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Despite the possible creation of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea was not raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Investigation on this matter since January of last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent unit against corruption since 1870.
Therefore, Tuesday&#39;s announcement has caught more than one by surprise.
It should be noted that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services held on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the Quebecois party&#39;s critic on public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this ad &quot;a rabbit out of the hat&quot; and &quot;a botched last-minute fix.&quot;
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
&quot;You will see the results when we announce it,&quot; he says simply.
&quot;We are aware of this problem.&quot;
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launching of a public survey.
&quot;The more Mr. Charest persists in preventing the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide,&quot; he explains.
&quot;The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest,&quot; explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To break this impasse, he suggests that Quebec grant a special mandate to the Comptroller General to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
&quot;We must be able to extend the mandate of the comptroller general,&quot; he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the intervener the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent crew is not the only project in the making in the Charest Government.
Quebec also asks Ottawa to amend the Penal Code to better accommodate this type of crime.
This request seems to come from the prosecutor of the Marteau operation, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister for Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed for his part that his counterpart for Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments in relation to this issue.
During the Spring 2001 operation related to the biker groups, 131 people were arrested even though the Penal Code had not been adapted.
Later, Ottawa pushed for the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Various watercourses are being closely monitored due to the heavy rainfall that has been recorded in various regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was a landslide in Shawinigan, in Mauricie.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
In the evening, another landslide occurred at Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, various regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
Also, an additional 20 to 40 millimeters is expected between now and Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors located north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations are added to the melting of the snow that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that various rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers, in Lanaudière.
The northern rivers, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and the Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused flooding in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have washed away a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security unit remains on alert and is monitoring the situation closely, according to Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecast Center, for its part, issued announcements on Wednesday announcing the strong flooding of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
They partially blame Dupont
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a bit of a setback before the Canadian Council for Broadcasting Standards (CCNR) over controversial statements regarding welfare and Haitians, as well as his foul language on radio .
The CCNR believes that Mr. Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained &quot;inaccurate information about welfare, improperly negative representation of Haitians, and foul language that should not be used.&quot; in the broadcasts broadcast during the day&quot;.
The Council has also indicated that discussions of suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two people who had committed suicide, do not violate broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made in broadcasts broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint by the Common Front of Quebec Welfare Recipients.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters must report data that is reliable and not misleading.
In relation to suicide, the defendant Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most Committee members have concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be viewed as a solution to life&#39;s problems.
&quot;The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes called into question of &quot;Dupont le midi&quot; have dealt with a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate way.&quot;
Therefore, in this respect, any blame has been dismissed.
The latest dispute concerned statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had staged a media confrontation that had aroused numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure if those in need were actually going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an improperly negative representation of Haitians.
&quot;I&#39;ve already served my three day suspension up there.&quot;
&quot;My file has been clean for a year and a half,&quot; said the presenter.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issuance of foul language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio station has collaborated &quot;even more than required.&quot;
The consequences will be minimal for the station, which must, among other things, announce decisions once in prime time within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who stands out in &quot;sanda&quot; (&quot;full contact&quot; kung-fu), kickboxing and thai box, climbs the mats and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
&quot;I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria,&quot; explained Zemmal, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
&quot;For me, I look everywhere for fights because, for those who don&#39;t enjoy the ground game that Mixed Martial Arts entails, there are few competitions in North America.&quot;
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championships, held on October 23-30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
&quot;I&#39;ve won in the full contact kickboxing and thai box categories,&quot; he explained.
&quot;I am currently preparing to participate in the san shou World Cup in China.&quot;
&quot;They will invite the athletes who have finished in the top four places in the last world championship in each category.&quot;
&quot;In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto.&quot;
&quot;In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place.&quot;
&quot;In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009,&quot; he added.
&quot;The interesting thing is that I have been progressing in each competition.&quot;
&quot;At this rate, I&#39;ll be the first this time or next year!&quot;
The &quot;san shou&quot; or &quot;sanda&quot; is a discipline originating in China in which it is allowed to hit with the fists and feet, as well as to throw the opponents to the ground.
The confrontations are originally held on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal only has to hold one competition in his career, he will undoubtedly attend the great tournament &quot;King of Sanda&quot;, the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
&quot;This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China,&quot; explains the likeable boy.
&quot;It&#39;s like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (Thailand&#39;s biggest stadium).&quot;
&quot;It has been an amazing experience&quot;.
Zemmal has won his first fight, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
&quot;The one who has beaten me is a true professional,&quot; he says.
&quot;There are four competitors per category (80kg, 85kg, 90kg and 90kg).&quot;
&quot;The winners of the semifinals meet in the final of their category.&quot;
&quot;Next, the champions of each category face off to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu.&quot;
450 million in contracts without bidding
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the center of this avalanche of more than one hundred contracts is a consortium made up of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained the most important contract, the project management contract, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec&#39;s decision to entrust the private sector with responsibility for managing this major $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Énergie gérance consortium was awarded the lucrative contract without prior competitive bidding.
For the Québec Party, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and cause prices to rise.
&quot;This is a new method of collusion and eliminating competition.&quot;
&quot;In other words, people, instead of doing it in secret, are now doing it openly,&quot; declared Sylvain Simard, a deputy for the Quebecois Party, at a press conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he says, he does not understand how the public interest can be served in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau responded in the afternoon, firmly denying that any collusion with this contract took place.
&quot;I&#39;m starting to get tired,&quot; he protested, defending that the PQ had acted &quot;dishonestly&quot; and &quot;with a lack of rigor.&quot;
He pointed out that &quot;the minimum&quot; would be for the PQ to apologize.
The consortia formula is a common practice throughout the world.
Normally, it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or several companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already started and will last until 2012.
In all cases, the contract has been awarded without competition coming into play; It has been a negotiation.
Furthermore, the consortia formula is no longer the exception to the rule in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the formula for consortiums in the technical advisory sector is being subjected to an investigation by the Government.
A quick look at the Quebec business register reveals more than 200 trusts, some of which appear permanent.
Thus, the Dessau company works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, ie Dessau.
Regarding the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that &quot;the territory of James Bay responds to a particular workforce dynamic and Hydro-Québec has responded specifically to it since the 1970s.&quot;
The big boss of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d&#39;énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been awarded directly.
&quot;If you respond to a tender and there are few bidders, your prices are going to be higher.&quot;
&quot;You have two options: you can contact the players in the sector and tell them: we are going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement with a good price.&quot;
&quot;However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competence of the people,&quot; said Mr. Laporte.
The contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 obtained by the Québec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After checking, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical consultancy contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has won 22 contracts, Genivar 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in Énergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the Énergie gérance contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has hinted that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are &quot;well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec.&quot;
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which &quot;finance&quot; it, before specifying that it is rather their leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. The &quot;green&quot; label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but deeply skeptical.
The Québec consumer hardly trusts sustainable development actors, as well as fair trade brands or organic certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Responsible Consumption Barometer, whose first results were published yesterday, the situation is even worse. Consumers are submerged in a media universe where messages advocating more responsible consumption abound, but they lament the lack of reliable information and consider that it even slows down their commitment.
Even if consumption of so-called &quot;socially responsible&quot; products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or their green advertising, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Responsible Consumption Observatory of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of the consumers question the reliability of the official certificates that carry the products called fair, as well as the credibility of the products and brands that carry labels indicating that they are &quot;eco-responsible&quot;, says the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take politicians&#39; speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, currently supported by about a third of Québec consumers.
In fact, the gaps and the doubtful nature of the information mean that 46% of consumers reject this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers say they are also wary of the supposed returns of the ecological products or services that they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, practically half of the consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, they changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% have given priority to shopping in stores in their neighborhood and have preferred to buy food products grown in their region, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points out of a hundred this year), Quebec&#39;s Homo consumus loves to take the place of the king of recycling who tries to reduce his impact on the environment by caring about the protection of the fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, this social conscience seems to be from the doors (of their car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of Québecois indicated that they had used public transport or shared a car to defend their ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioral survey, which has just completed its first edition, support cycling and walking.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to make a financial commitment to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to collaborate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, which were hoping for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy back the eXcentris cinema complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent from Daniel Langlois and give him back his true film vocation, have not obtained what what they asked for
The Government has agreed to become involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would, in fact, be less than the initial expectations; This could constitute a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first action plan and a request for 12.8 million last spring, but the requests have since been revised downward.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris file, sent a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a last report a dozen days ago.
However, SODEC received a counter-proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
Parallèle and Angus have until December 31 to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a State donation should be completely discarded.
Let us remember that the Association of owners of cinemas and cinematographic complexes of Quebec was opposed to a direct investment from the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, various representatives of the sector do claim considerable financial aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the same, has carried the charge of auteur cinema in his premises of the complex for ten years, after financing his own construction, which could justify a repeal by the Treasury Council.
The lack of theaters for independent films is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had managed to retain its clientele.
The company Angus and Parallèle, directed by Christian Yaccarini, for their part are promoting a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to work their way towards the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallèle, continues to screen films at eXcentris.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three theaters on February 27th, showing the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois &quot;Des hommes et des dieux&quot;.
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals they have received.
The veil of self-conscious Canada is lifted...
The new US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be the complex of Canadians with respect to the Americans, but at the same time reflect the feeling of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
US diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters do not think about Canada-US relations when they go to vote and believe that President Obama&#39;s visit has helped the Conservative government pass its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the US embassy in Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday offer more juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, that is, during the federal electoral campaign, recounts to what extent the United States does not enter into the issues debated by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the American ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
&quot;Perhaps political leaders are driven by an inferiority complex almost inherent in Canadians when it comes to dealing with everyday domestic issues, rather than leaving such a choice to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign) &quot;, writes.
Consequently, he concludes, the United States is &quot;the proverbial elephant of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too dangerous to talk about.&quot;
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this &quot;deafening silence&quot; because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
&quot;Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and, even more, the head of a party to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when voting.&quot;
This feeling of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, charge d&#39;affaires in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
&quot;His trip will help ensure the survival of the government during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, through which Canada will register deficits for the first time in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between 30,000 and 40,000 million dollars,&quot; writes Mr. Breese.
No mention is made anywhere that the government had to prorogue Parliament before Christmas to avoid being replaced by the coalition or that the opposition parties conditioned their survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington to the increasingly negative image conveyed by drama series broadcast on the CBC in the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which not very subtle references are made to Maher Arar, the &quot;No-Fly-List&quot; or even kidnappings for the CIA to carry out vigorous interrogations.
Another cable recounts that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to take in some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied that it was, but that it depended &quot;on a case-by-case basis.&quot;
At the end of the meeting, they wrote &quot;a document has been delivered to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin.&quot;
&quot;The Secretary agreed to review the file.&quot;
Lastly, we can mention that tempers have heated up in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, declared on CBC radio that the person responsible for this mass leak should be &quot;murdered&quot;.
In the United States they echo Mike Huckabee.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in one hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) in an amount that corresponds to practically one third of the additional reduction that must be carried out carried out to stabilize the planet&#39;s climate before 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of large concrete projects that the UN expects to be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, are replaced by compact fluorescent bulbs or, even better, by light-emitting diode bulbs (DEL or &quot;LED&quot; in English), it would prevent much of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHGs emitted on the planet to light humans.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen last year, large emitting countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that were to reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of said amount should still be reduced to stabilize, before 2020, the increase in temperatures by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from getting out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated as heat and the rest, that is, 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluo-compact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is reduced two times more.
Fluo-compact bulbs last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a incandescent bulb, which allows us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in a hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also be powered by dimmers and emit very little heat.
Above, they do not contain any mercury.
Various specialists have expressed their reservations regarding compact fluo bulbs, since they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the manufacturers post instructions.
However, the report indicates, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet are not compact fluorescent light bulbs, but coal-fired power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce electricity that is wasted with incandescent light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages that this international program would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save one billion dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that is, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost 2,500 million.
Ivory Coast eagerly awaits announcement of election results
The Secretary General of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the &quot;immediate&quot; publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d&#39;Ivoire, since the established deadlines have expired.
&quot;The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately,&quot; said a spokesman for the UN chief.
&quot;Calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to show their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced.&quot;
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed Wednesday&#39;s midnight deadline to pass without the results being published, three days after Sunday&#39;s vote.
About forty minutes before the end of the term, the president of the CEI had commented on television that the commission &quot;continued working&quot; to announce the results.
On Wednesday, the requests for the CEI to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara have multiplied in the world.
However, Gbagbo&#39;s side is counting on the annulment by the Constitutional Council of the &quot;fraudulent&quot; votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N&#39;Guessan, campaign manager for the president of Ivory Coast, has claimed that voter intimidation maneuvers carried out by the FN in the north of the country had discouraged supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepts the complaints made by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo&#39;s opponents consider the country&#39;s highest court to be non-neutral, since it is headed by Paul Yao N&#39;Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo&#39;s.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has judged the delay in the publication of the results &quot;unacceptable&quot; and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to claim victory. .
His allies say Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from releasing the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have put the icing on the cake for the reunification and reconciliation process of a country divided in two for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on October 31, with 38% of the vote compared to 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% on the mainland (9.7% taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by data corrected with seasonal variations (CVE) provisional published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
The data for the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the active population in continental territory and 9.7% with the DOM.
In one year, the unemployment rate has registered an increase of 0.1 points.
In general, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but want to work, whether or not they are available in the two weeks for work and whether or not they are looking for a job.
The situation of young people present in the labor market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year ), 25% including the DOM.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed in the ILO sense.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, up to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), that is, 482,000 people from over 50 years, a figure that rises to 6.6% with the DOM.
Unemployment has only been stable among people between the ages of 25 and 49, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union&#39;s statistics agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, a director of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is under investigation and has been jailed in the Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, in the framework of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social assets, embezzlement of public funds and assets, cover-up, active corruption, influence peddling and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
&quot;Alexandre Guérini is going to fight and he will answer all the questions that the magistrate raises, not ghosts.&quot;
&quot;It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing is to prove them,&quot; his lawyer, Florence Rault, had told AFP before his client&#39;s appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, has wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began to investigate and also jailed one of their close people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, all his client has done has been to take care of the landfills that he has to manage.
As for the allocation of the contracts or the destination of the funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to the lawyer Simon.
In the framework of this file, Daniel Pinna, former general director of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, has also been under investigation since Wednesday for embezzlement and complicity, but he has been released on probation and is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
&quot;My client has been able to explain all the facts that have been reproached.&quot;
&quot;The investigating magistrate has taken the explanations into account and has released him,&quot; explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, four other people were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been accused of &quot;influence peddling and passive corruption&quot;.
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for &quot;theft and embezzlement of public property by a person engaged in public service&quot; and for &quot;complicity in the embezzlement of public funds&quot;, respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini&#39;s partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for &quot;covering up the abuse of social goods.&quot;
Among those who have confronted Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently jailed in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
The investigators suspect that their companies have served to launder the capital of the great banditry.
The investigation is being carried out within the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 after receiving some anonymous communications, for alleged fraud in the allocation of public contracts, particularly in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation points out that the investigations are particularly focused on the allocation and operating conditions of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss affair: Eliseo has exaggerated Syria&#39;s mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for &quot;espionage&quot;, has kept the public in France on edge, alerted diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of US diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee has explained his strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice for managing their own &quot;hostage&quot; crises in Iran (a small group of Shining Path).
They show how the French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman was not in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the US courts for trafficking in materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the stark reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media into implying that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played a key role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he did nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is headlined &quot;Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage-taking cases.&quot;
The Elysee&#39;s adviser for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d&#39;Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talk with the US diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens forcibly held in Iran.
&quot;Make noise&quot;, they say, &quot;continually release&quot; in the media the words &quot;fundamental human rights&quot;, &quot;innocence&quot;, &quot;immediate release&quot;.
All to embarrass the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
&quot;When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it even more often.&quot;
Because, once the attempts to negotiate through discreet channels have been exhausted, &quot;silence will not solve anything&quot;, the Iranians are &quot;experts in delaying maneuvers&quot;.
Mr. Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is &quot;a common Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail.&quot;
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which will take place on August 16, the day she will take refuge in the French embassy) &quot;will require the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians&quot; (230,000 euros as a reward).
In addition, he points out that the Eliseo anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that &quot;is going to increase.&quot;
The Iranians could &quot;in the near future detain another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,&quot; he says.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after twelve days, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by decision of a judge.
The US embassy, like many observers, doubts this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which closes the Iranian clandestine networks for the acquisition of material for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand constitutes bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Release the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier guarantees that this was not the case.
Elisha, he affirms, not only &quot;has been greatly surprised by the judge&#39;s decision&quot;, but has tried to oppose it.
&quot;There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice&quot; (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but &quot;the French Government cannot annul the decision&quot; of the court, he comments.
Mr. Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand is still under the &quot;close&quot; surveillance of the French intelligence services.
The Elysée adviser dials a phone number, hangs up, and then informs the US diplomat that the Iranian &quot;is currently in some buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy.&quot;
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Élysée spared no effort, using statements and organized &quot;leaks&quot; in the media to make believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an &quot;important&quot; and &quot;influential&quot; role in &quot;mediator&quot;.
The Americans observe this activity with a certain irony and verify that the manipulation bears its fruits, since several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions &quot;the media &#39;blitz&#39; by French officials.&quot;
Why such &quot;gratitude&quot; towards Mr. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
&quot;Despite their laudatory statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.&quot;
Next, the document deals with the reasons that have led Elisha to give rise to this fiction.
The great communication effort &quot;is intended to validate Sarkozy&#39;s policy of openness towards Syria&quot;, he believes.
A policy launched in 2008, which &quot;in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been branded premature and undeserved&quot;.
By &quot;exaggerating the Syrian role&quot;, Paris tries &quot;to show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region.&quot;
The goal is also to &quot;sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran.&quot;
The US embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier confides in him: &quot;Of course, we don&#39;t know if the Syrians have done something or not.&quot;
&quot;But anyway, we have thanked him.&quot;
&quot;At the very least, this should cause confusion among the Iranians.&quot;
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysee.
In a statement, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for having played an &quot;active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot.&quot;
Starting at midnight, Korean youth cannot play online
The South Korean government will adopt a so-called &quot;Cinderella&quot; law that will prevent teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight for young people under the age of 16, according to representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family. .
&quot;Many children play all night and then find it difficult to study at school and lead a normal life during the day.&quot;
&quot;We believe that this law is necessary to protect their health and their right to sleep,&quot; Jo Rin, the minister in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
The companies will have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government also considers asking companies to limit the time of daily access to these games when the parents of the young people so request, added the person in charge.
In addition, it will make available to anyone who requests it, free computer programs that allow limiting the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most &quot;connected&quot; countries and newspapers regularly report on various events linked to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced off against 58 other countries.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the organizing countries
In the midst of the storm caused by suspicions of corruption, the FIFA executive committee appoints on Thursday the organizing countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political election where influence struggles and lobbying can reach take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, the traditional stronghold of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, since the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue with its implementation in the United States or in the Far East (Japan). , South Korea).
The list of personalities that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies the economic and political interests that are at stake in a World Cup.
Backstage transactions are therefore likely to last until the very last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to FIFA&#39;s evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) bids have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when it comes to voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the chances of their country, the birthplace of soccer, which only hosted the World Cup once , in 1966.
The BBC added fuel to the fire on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that has exposed three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to upset FIFA and embarrass the English officials, who have engaged in intense lobbying in recent weeks led by David Cameron.
The Head of Government hopes to repeat the successful coup carried out by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had managed to organize the Olympic Games for London in 2005. 2012.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore England&#39;s brilliance against the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spain-Portugal duo also has many strong points thanks to their stadiums, already ready, their experience (1982 World Cup in Spain, Olympic Games in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the bleak economic and financial prospects for both countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they achieve is to give points to Russia, which has become a weighty outsider despite the gaps in its candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to go to Zurich and has denounced &quot;unfair competition in the preparation of the vote&quot;, in a direct allusion to the accusations made by the English press against the members of the EC.
&quot;They are bringing up their dirty laundry, trying to compromise them,&quot; Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, seems the most logical favourites.
The world&#39;s leading economic power and home to FIFA&#39;s main sponsors, the country seems to be ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have separately developed an excellent project.
However, these new bids seem premature for two countries that co-hosted the championship in 2002.
Another risk: the concession of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of possibilities for 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue with its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be hurt by weak TV rights paid (based on time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the test
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had given it to be understood that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d&#39;Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have the slightest doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
One mandate in Elysha leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will be a candidate again in 2012.
However, the evidence for this does not mix well with the mystery often associated with the presidential role.
Therefore, it is always necessary to pretend that one doubts.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, believe it or not, Jacques Chirac&#39;s friends claimed that he was not ruling out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision &quot;sometime in autumn 2011&quot;.
Therefore, the fact that he deals with the deputies of the UMP, on Tuesday night at the Elysée, the possibility of &quot;two terms&quot; has caused a certain stir.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The president only indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It was simply conveying the facts, not an advertisement.
It is not the first time that he has spoken of the presidential elections, with a humorous tone, in meetings of this type.
&quot;In the worst, or best, of the cases, you will still spend seven and a half years with me,&quot; he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: &quot;Do not think that I do not consider what will come next.&quot;
His statements the day before yesterday do not bring him closer to the candidacy, nor less.
They arouse comment for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has come to the fore that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to come clean.
Quite the contrary; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many people in the PS to demand that the battle be organized earlier than expected.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon&#39;s candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy&#39;s (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L&#39;Express).
&quot;We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the subject&quot;, the Prime Minister&#39;s entourage reacted immediately and prudently.
&quot;If you think you can lose, you won&#39;t be a candidate,&quot; says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
&quot;He will always think he can win,&quot; corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its acquisitions of State Bills
The last meeting of the Board of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to specify the modalities for exiting the crisis or, at least, announce the interruption of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations that should end at the end of the year. of year.
Because of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt issuance institute will certainly not be able to afford to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk aggravating a more than complicated situation today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be just as high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, supported the active role played by the ECB in favor of solving the debt crisis of the European states.
He did not want to say if he thought the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its government bond purchase program.
&quot;I reserve my opinion for my European colleagues &quot;....
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no more eloquent in terms of his intentions, indicating only that the purchase program of State bills in the secondary market &quot;continued&quot; and that &quot;we&#39;ll see what we decide&quot; during the meeting on Thursday.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB is going to keep its main rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of Treasury bonds by the ECB has doubled last week to reach close to 1,350 million euros.
In addition, according to the indiscreet market operators, yesterday he would have bought Irish and Portuguese titles again.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have acquired securities for an amount of 67,000 million euros since May 2010.
Among market players, there is no doubt that the buying will continue (see page 29).
Economists also don&#39;t foresee any significant course changes.
Although loan operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB&#39;s arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited allocations of liquidity at beneficial conditions and with durations that vary between one week and three months.
Economists expect this device to continue for a few months today.
&quot;I don&#39;t imagine he&#39;s going to significantly modify his program.&quot;
&quot;If not, it would run the risk of triggering new tensions in the short term,&quot; says Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
&quot;It seems more likely that there will be a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011,&quot; anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In relation to interventions in the public debt market, &quot;the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of said obligations so that the market remains stable,&quot; adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks&#39; exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institute has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
&quot;It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a sharp rise in the yields paid by the most fragile states,&quot; an important bond manager opined yesterday.
Because, if interest rates go through the roof, States will have even more problems reducing their indebtedness, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government weathers the storm
After Italy started the week in an ominous way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the ebb in 10-year bond rates.
A precarious recovery of calm.
After a meeting with the Minister of the Economy, the regional presidents stated that they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as &quot;indecipherable&quot; and that an &quot;unpredictable&quot; weekend was expected, statements later denied by the person concerned.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with German long-term rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy hedge contracts (CRQ) had shot up to 263 points, causing a some commotion in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German rates was greater than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about &quot;the turbulence in the markets&quot; and a possible contagion from Ireland.
&quot;The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland.&quot;
&quot;The bad news is that it&#39;s like Portugal,&quot; explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In reality, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a jug of cold water for the government.
Italian growth is estimated to reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget being examined in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to the 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2, 7%).
Hence the rumor that new budget provisions may be applied after the holidays, for an amount of 7,000 million euros.
&quot;If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be adopted,&quot; says Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
&quot;The foundations of their economy are in order and their accounts are in good shape, as we have been saying for a long time,&quot; said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
&quot;There is no immediate problem, neither in the short nor in the long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are less than those required from other countries says Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The problem of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a vote of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, an unfavorable period would open up for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening mechanisms to combat the crisis
Christine Lagarde has already repeated it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: &quot;I believe that we have already demonstrated on Sunday, night and day, that the Europeans are clearly supportive, determined, committed to defending their currency and of your currency zone.&quot;
Although it was relative, the relaxation registered yesterday in the types of the obligations of the European States has boosted the governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of normalization.
The rating agency Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s announced that it could lower the rating of Portugal&#39;s debt, currently the most frequent target of speculation.
&quot;As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which is weighing heavily on banking systems,&quot; say economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since &quot;the political pace is much slower than the pace of the markets.&quot;
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it hides, the European countries are intensifying the debates to reinforce the mechanisms for exiting the crisis that already exist.
Informal consultations among the most directly affected Finance Ministers and, in general, with their G20 counterparts are on the right track.
And this also taking into account the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of unconventional support measures for euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Facility (FEEF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in the Far East about the news of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first issues of EFSF titles are expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, an official US representative confided to Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase in the funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the countries that are in the front line, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organization of the labor market.
These reforms are added to the austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to go down a different path than the one followed by Greece and Ireland.
Both want to avoid at all costs requesting international aid before applying their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms they consider essential to increase confidence in a lasting manner.
Finally, the capitalist partners of the European funds are considering the options available to accelerate the process of normalization of the public bond markets.
Passing through Paris, on November 24, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the 750,000 million euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take out the portfolio again .
The economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, consider that an additional amount of around 100 billion euros would be sufficient, &quot;preferably&quot; in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
There is an instrument for this: the European financial stabilization mechanism, currently endowed with 60,000 million euros.
A piece of advice that, without a doubt, the European capitals could examine in detail.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and may affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday at noon and two, the Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, the heavy snowfall affects the north of the Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows lightly in the Île-de-France.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm are expected, occasionally between 7 and 10 cm, in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d&#39;Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Lower Normandy, Île-de-France and Limousin regions.
The snowfalls are strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d&#39;Armor, access to several departmental roads has been prohibited for heavy vehicles over 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
According to the gendarmes, driving on the Brittany secondary network is complicated, which is why they recommend that you not drive except in case of need and certain TER vehicles have been prohibited from driving during the day.
During Thursday, school transport has been prohibited in Picardy.
No specific measure had been planned on Wednesday night to limit the circulation of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture &quot;urges all drivers to drive with the utmost care on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation.&quot;
The General Directorate of civil aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at the Parisian airport of Roissy and 10% at Orly on Thursday due to the expected snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Great Britain, Gatwick airport, south of London, and Edinburgh airport, in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro of the Grand Paris: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in the Île-de-France has reached its peak, it rains billions.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23,000 million for the Grand Paris metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To initiate this SGP, the State has announced an allocation of funds of 4,000 million euros.
On a theoretical level, this amount will be what will later allow the SGP to obtain loans in the markets to finance part of its double loop.
Today, finally, we have the first accounts.
The amending finance law of 2010, examined in the finance commission of the National Assembly this morning, contains the provisions for finding the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special tax on equipment and the increase in the tax on offices in the Ile-de-France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is &quot;for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris.&quot;
In addition, it is fixed in numbers: &quot;The product of this tax is 117 million euros a year.&quot;
The second is a modification of a tax on offices that already exists &quot;to modernize it, increase its product and allocate said increase to the Société du Grand Paris.&quot;
How much would be obtained with this method?
Who knows.
No figures are given in the text.
But it is far from 4,000 million.
&quot;It is specified that the fiscal resources are added to the 4,000 million euros of the allocation of funds that the State will mobilize and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses,&quot; we can read in the explanatory statement.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
&quot;From the moment revenue is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4,000 million later, as we explained.&quot;
&quot;It will be recorded in the budget and used on an as-needed basis.&quot;
The SGP calculates that it will begin to receive the 4,000 million in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the promised 4,000 million do not appear in the credit, can cause a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on December 7th.
Avenging hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems like a scandal in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes on an international scale and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let&#39;s go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) consists exclusively of press clippings.
The &quot;extraordinary&quot; US revelations about Berlusconi&#39;s sexual mores merely reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and the sinisterly ridiculing profile of Gaddafi has long given ideas to artists of cabaret to create their skits.
The rule that secret files should only consist of news that is public knowledge is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do new research (or do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism do not only trust what they already know, which reconfirms what that they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown&#39;s success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as the head of the secret services is lazy (or has little eagerness) (otherwise it could be, I don&#39;t know, editor of Libération), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the US embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as that published in Newsweek the week before.
So why have the disclosures of these files caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they are just saying what every educated person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since World War II and since Heads of State can call each other on the phone or fly to dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited exercises of representation, have become centers of espionage.
Any viewer who watches investigative films knows this perfectly well, we just pretend that we don&#39;t know out of hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of US diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker could see the top secrets of the most powerful country in the world greatly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the &quot;executioners&quot;.
But let&#39;s get into the true nature of what has happened.
In the past, in Orwell&#39;s time, all power could be conceived as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell&#39;s prophecy has come true since, being able to control every move thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it is now, that even the crypts of power&#39;s secrets cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the citizens&#39; avenger) can know all the secrets of power.
How can you put up with a power that can no longer even keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); It is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without a secret, since it comes from the public sphere; but revealing, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton&#39;s secrets were empty secrets is taking away all power.
WikiLeaks hasn&#39;t done any harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but it did, and a lot, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any confidential information on the Internet, since it would be like publishing it on a billboard in the middle of the street.
But it is also clear that, with today&#39;s technologies, you cannot expect to have confidential conversations over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a Head of State has flown in and made contact with one of the counterparts.
How will they be able to maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my forecast is something out of science fiction and, therefore, fictional, but I imagine government agents who move discreetly in stagecoaches with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been memorized or, at most, hiding some data written on the heels of his shoes.
That information is then kept, in a single copy, in locked drawers: after all, the Watergate spy attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology currently crabs, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has once again created a wired (telephone) telegraph.
Videotapes (analogue) had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, going forward and backward, discovering all the secrets of editing, whereas now CDs (digital) only allow you to go forward or backward from chapter to chapter. , that is, to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the travel involved, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary that politics and communication techniques lead us back to horse-drawn carriages.
One last comment.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was secretly going on in the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that request confidential information from the press.
Climate: the bungling of France in its financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to examine whether the rapidly unlocked financing promises (called fast start or early) made by developed countries have been respected.
And the French bungling has been revealed.
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union promised to contribute 7,200 million euros in three years and France 1,260 million euros (that is, 420 million a year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put its best cards on the table to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a big side event, flyer distribution...
Operation Transparency turned out to be appreciable and was appreciated for what it really is worth: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2,200 million euros in 2010, which places it on the right track towards fulfilling its commitment of 7,200 million in 2012.
But, if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
Under the Copenhagen Accord, the money must be &quot;new and additional&quot; to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without hurting official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what &quot;new and additional&quot; means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonization, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Currently, everyone chooses the reference that best suits them.
For example, the European Commission has taken 2009 as a reference: international financing is maintained and 150 million are added over three years as fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks in terms of the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers the financing of &quot;all new projects&quot; for the year 2010 to be &quot;new and additional&quot;.
In other words, no reference is made to spending in previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France&#39;s aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), while it claims to honor its commitment on &quot;new and additional&quot; funds...
Another crucial element, the distribution between donations and loans.
Once again, there is no standard and everyone chooses the method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that every euro lent is equivalent to a euro donated.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (frequently projects related to emission reductions that are based on more efficient technologies), it is fallacious to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that will be donate... At most, only the cost of borrowing for the lending country (ie the equivalent of one interest rate) should count towards your commitments.
But France does not find such reasoning useful: it &quot;respects&quot; its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donations (36.1 million euros). ; check out the EU document to see for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it by 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to fulfill its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
A nice trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France is committing a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to actions over time and, on the other, in relation to the actual financial effort.
By spending just €36.1 million, he manages to give the impression that he is spending a &quot;new and additional&quot; €420 million, as promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in negotiations, since developing countries are not fools...
The chapter on early financing is a trifle, relatively short-term, in relation to the climate negotiations as a whole.
But it could be one too many grains of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let&#39;s hope that&#39;s not the case.
Be that as it may, it is essential to learn from this first year of early financing.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, especially, France could move forward the discussions on in-play betting in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter currently being discussed): we will not get rid of the question of &quot;additional character&quot; nor the method for compute the loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on this issue as it is on others.
Therefore, we are left with hope for the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancún next week.
A surprise announcement on France&#39;s fast start and on its vision of &quot;additional character&quot; and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence necessary to advance the negotiations.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old boy ingests 81 different chemical substances in one day, according to a study published Wednesday by the Générations Futures association (the old movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results &quot;do not have significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problems dealt with&quot;, purchased in supermarkets in the Oise and Paris between July and September the foods that are usually consume a child of about ten years in four meals and a snack a day.
These model meals, which adhere to official recommendations (five parts fresh fruit and vegetables, three parts dairy, and 1.5 liters of water per day), as well as sweets, were tested in laboratories for chemicals. , pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, of which 42 classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as sure carcinogens, as well as 37 substances capable of acting as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
&quot;Although legal limits are not exceeded for individual chemicals in virtually all cases, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is of concern,&quot; indicates the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a school snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green beans, included in the meal, in which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the Russian steak, the canned tuna, and even the loaf of bread or gum were laced with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyzes revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most &quot;nutritious&quot; with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to microwave the food was not completely clean.
The ultimate risk that these &quot;contaminant cocktails&quot; pose to the consumer &quot;is probably underestimated,&quot; the study says.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed &quot;in view of the seriousness of the situation&quot; to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb &quot;the increase in diseases associated with civilization&quot;.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EASA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
