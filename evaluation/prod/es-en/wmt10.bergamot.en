Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth American president in history.
The diploma, medal and cheque of $1.4 million will receive them, among other things, for the exceptional effort to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
White House chief and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have plenty to do.
First, visit to the Nobel Institute, where for the first time he will meet the five members of the committee that, in October, elected him between 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then plan for a meeting with Norway's King Harald V and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive him, even if the third person to receive him in office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased further with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which he does not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and cheque of ten million Swedish kroner (approximately 24 million Czech kronor).
It intends to donate them charity paraphins, but has not yet decided which particular organization.
During his full program, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which they will attend, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude towards the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling of not worthy of it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he said it represents "a challenge to take action."
Defender of nature accused of blackmail
The police of Litom-ice accused the president of the civic association Spole.nost ochránc. p.rody Litom-ice (Socie Society of Nature Defenders Litom-ice) of blackmail.
Last year he appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw appeals he demanded money from investors for his own benefit, said Litom-ice police spokeswoman Alena Romová.
The president of the Society of Defenders of Nature Litom-ice is Lubomír Studnieka.
He is currently being held and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like containers too much to separate the trash.
In Prague, citizens can separate drink packaging and in the villages of southern Moravia you can find containers to separate garbage everywhere.
And in Brno?
There it takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that in Brno the garbage is not separated at all.
It seems to me that, in order to be the second largest city in the Republic, municipalities are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is completely behind in the separation of garbage, not only because we, the citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a bottle of PET in the center into the right container?
It is almost impossible, above all it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I've found so far is in Moravské námstí Square, opposite Potrefená Huse.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but that seems too little to me.
Needless to mention, elsewhere it is not easy to separate the garbage either.
That's why a lot of my friends prefer not to separate it.
For vagrancy
The thing is, the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I myself offered to throw several glass and plastic bottles into the trash after a party.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red container nearby.
Fortunately, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already overflowing with the container.
It's still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to interest Brno's socialists too much.
They prefer to buy the city the hockey extraliga, which embarrasses us throughout the republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I'm glad I could compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little, with official statistics.
According to the EKO-KOM society, Brno is truly the worst in the entire Jihomoravsk kraj region.
The budget of "Paroubek" took money from income and sickness benefits
After the left, despite the government's view, added funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for rents, sick leave or building savings.
But neither for the interest on state debt or international litigation.
This will hurt everyone who governs in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and communists imposed the increase for some groups, they hoped that the government would subsequently borrow for sensitive expenses, income or sickness benefits. "That only means postponing the problems for the future, is laying mines," Janota says.
What happens is that, when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest and, one day, you have to return the money.
The state doesn't have many options to raise money.
If it does not reduce social subsidies or state operating expenses, it has to increase taxes.
To everyone to whom the left added now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later, so do his children.
People don't have to worry about income or sickness benefits, they'll get them. From these accounts, 1.8 billion disappeared.
But the price to pay will be the increase in public debt; next year only $163 billion will not be missing from the treasury, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's effort, the debt will continue to rise alongside interest expense.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer come up with slightly increasing VAT or reducing maternity benefits, as the government did in its deficit package.
Due to the dislocated money for some groups of voters, next year it will also be five billion to complete the construction of motorways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors where the tendering has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and its price cannot be reduced either.
The maximum you can do is keep them, which is not free either.
That means delay or cessation of the 30 large buildings; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
SSD proposed a salomonic solution for the decrease of funds: it will get money from the dividends of EEZ, which is mostly owned by the state, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never secure and it is not a bottomless bag.
Last year of theEZ allocated 18 billion to the budget.
Every year of dividends are liquidated, served to complete the account for rents or serve as a reserve for the prepared rent reform.
In addition, with this trick, according to EU rules, the real budget deficit increases to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The money transfer carnival doesn't end here.
Nearly three billion was obtained from the budget to award several compensation to victims of communism and crime, or for litigation costs, including in construction savings.
It is not clear whether the state will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
"If we lose any international litigation, maybe we'll have to pay for it," Janota says.
The minister will then have to save money inside the spring or, at worst, use the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the Státní pokladna project (State Cowack), which is worth two billion and has already been initiated. It should allow online monitoring what the various authorities are spending on.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone will be able to run on two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone on which the user can, by pressing a key, switching between several operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
Just pressing a key, they pass in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
Precisely this possibility is the objective of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualizing software for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at once.
They can switch between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of the company VMware said in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was introduced in November last year and several days ago it was first demonstrated.
It will be launched in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer any fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work, at the same time.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is at its peak.
VMware is cooperating with European and US operators to test smartphone virtualization and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Not only are the telekicker keepers in Krkonoe concerned about slopes without snow.
The lack of snow makes people not book ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoe you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including for Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but they're still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they ask immediately about our opinion, if this Christmas there will be snow or mud," said the maintainer of the news portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend on New Year's Eve on New Year's Eve should no longer hesitate to book the stay.
Those who prefer to save the money and put the quality of accommodation in second place can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers of the hoteliers of the most part are offered weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will continue to offer them, but they will soon give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will sell quickly, Jandura said.
Ingotours, a travel agency in Vrchlabí, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered are still free.
That's why we've already prepared some last-minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
Vrchlabí's travel agency can still offer New Year's Eve in Krkonoe, but there are fewer free places.
They are also sold very well in the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year interest in winter stays is hurt by the lack of snow in Krkonoe.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year on the mountain without snow.
If the slopes remain snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will run out too," Schiefert says.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sn.kou; last year it was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last places free.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February is also sold well," said Pec's top hotel director, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of New Year's Eve stays are already occupied at the Omnia hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské Lázn.
On the contrary, at the most recent hotel in Janské Lázn, at Christmas half of the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we are about sixty percent of the occupation capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in stays in Krkonoe will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
For the time being, however, it seems that the hoteliers of Krkonoe will be left out of the snow waiting.
Temperatures should fall on Thursday and, if there is precipitation, in the mountains it should snow.
But then the temperatures will rise again, reported Jia Jakubsk, from the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is funny that Barack Obama, the president with the smartest man's reputation, as a diligent student repeats on the Afghan issue the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his Afghan approach, eagerly awaited, it was proved to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only is the speech "just like in Iraq" used in the same text several times, but he also did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's January 2007 statement for his own statement: "A new way forward."
It was he himself who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country he is suffering from civil war. And that he criticized it as "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful, so that nothing is spoken of in Iraq today in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, yet objectively left his successor a much more favorable initial situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
The camp captains again asked for the increase in the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal. He, even despite traditional subordinate relations, subjected undecided riflemen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked for 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn't think of anything better, so he at least tricked the general over 10,000 military personnel.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of Obama's entire strategy seems his goal, to begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finish this procedure in three years. Obama's entire doctrine generated more questions from the answers he offered.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to trust anyone and no agreement is reached.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are accustomed to changing the chief every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin. After him, patriarchal tribal relations will remain.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated because of confusing relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even establishing a state that is "able of action," a minimum target of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy is bucked by his voluntarism.
For the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now about to erupt.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing about reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "go home soon" will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date of the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, as the Taliban will consider it an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans are less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their constituents what the security of Germany or Italy has with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: to try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to look for answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that three years to go before the presidential elections and that is why there is still plenty of time to find another strategy, if this proves a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank executives won't receive cash bonuses again
Senior executives at the Goldman Sachs bank will not receive the cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced this to react to the harsh criticism of its salary practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum of five years.
In addition, actions may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to link bonuses on Wall Street with long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longest road to go, said former JPMorgan investor banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs bank faced criticism after departing nearly $17 billion (almost $300 billion from CZK) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total sum of the bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters agency, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, the $20 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax in one go, with a tax of 50 per cent, on bank bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds (approximately CZKs) .
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received the Nobel Prizes in all categories except Physical
Five women, which is a record number, received today in Stockholm from King Charles XVI Gustav of Sweden this year's Nobel Prize winners, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Moller, was also among the winners.
The Nobel Prize in medicine was received by two American bionomies, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as his compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in chemistry was received by Israeli Ada Jonath and the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for the explanation of the structure and function of the ribosomes.
The last prize, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without an award-winning woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each winner picked up the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This amount in each category is up to 10 million Swedish kroner (approximately 25 million Czech kroner).
In the case of several winners in each category, the prize is distributed to each other.
The traditionally most anticipated Nobel Prize, the Peace Prize, was received today afternoon in Oslo, Norway, by US President Barack Obama.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy of having been awarded, as he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers the resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle.
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the finance minister Eduard Janota, who is considering his stay in the government, as he does not agree with the version of the state budget for next year, approved Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
The budget, and perhaps also Janota's tenure in the cabinet, is supposed to be the topics of his meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too big, which continues to deepen the public finance crisis.
President Radim Ochvat's spokesman reported on the appointment.
On his tenure, Janota wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
Under the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
The House of Representatives, however, on Wednesday approved the left-wing proposals for the transfer of funds and increased money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government disagrees with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a serious conflict of domestic policy. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer's bureaucratic cabinet, the form of which was agreed in spring by the SDG, SSD and the Green Party, are beginning to be controversial.
Critics say the budget, in the version approved by the House of Representatives, de facto liquidates the package of savings measures, imposed in the autumn by the Fischer government to curb public indebtedness.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he declared during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had long neglected "the serious problem," that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
According to him today they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president says.
SDG leader Mirek Topolánek said the budget is appalling and the government should think of its future existence.
SDG Vice-President Petr Neas said for TK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of SSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and described similar words as "strong judgments."
The head of the SSD, Jisí Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek by saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government. It will surpass 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, SSD said the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The popular were happy, too.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans say Hollywood's new film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say the leading roles are played by American actors.
History speaks of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played in his biography by the American actor winning an Elder, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked him to play him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret you, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in Eastwood's drama about the world of boxing Milion Dollar Baby, played the role of the movement leader for the abolition of slavery, who ended up being a slave, the fictional president of the United States, and even God in Evan Almighty. But he rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invintus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes he is capable of uniting his people through sport, and that's why he decides to unite the rugby players, who belong as far as the outsiders, to the world.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years for Mandela's story to reach theaters.
"I had no other goal to play this role in a way that was as close to reality as possible," Freeman said.
Naturally, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dined with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
"I discovered that when I squeezed your hand, I got your energy, it's transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel," he said.
It's important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of Francois Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was, when he finally met for the first time with Pienaar at his home.
I remember knocking on the door, he opened and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar in my life was: "In the film I look much higher."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and also speaks of ambitions for the Elder.
Daily magazine film critic Variety Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The secret of splendour over Norway resolved: Russians tested for a missile
A special bright effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
Russia's Defense Ministry ended up acknowledging yesterday that near the borders with Norway it tested a ballistic intercontinental missile.
The pitch failed again. The missile, like "Bulava," previously intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimír Putin.
Even his repeated presence in the missile tests has not had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, did not fly or a failure in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write of "Bulavá" as "a missile that doesn't fly."
A missile that doesn't fly, but it shines.
During this, the 13th Test, there was no problem at first.
At the end of the flight there were again technical problems in the apparatus.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which was floating submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the launch from a boat that is moving and is submerged at the same time.
That's why the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, is likely to actually be the failed "Bulavá."
The Norwegians haven't hesitated from the very beginning that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by claiming that you can't just talk about a failure.
The first two stages of the missile endured and the breakdown occurred in the third.
In previous cases, the engines were immediately damaged in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely without mistakes, according to the Ministry of Defense's management only six of the thirteen were failed.
The success of almost fifty percent full of optimism to the generals and that is why they continue to state that "Bulava" will one day fly smoothly and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose maximum total weight is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA from Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will again appear at 51 at a professional hockey meeting.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his team CSKA Moscow and possibly play Friday in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently chairs CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov practises constantly and has committed to helping the team.
"We just need to sort out some formal issues," the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single game.
"I think Fetisov is one of those who manages to lift the spirits of the other players," Nemchinov said.
According to AP, if Fetisov returns to the ice rinks, he will become the longest-running professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary striker Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, during the entire season, and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The largest in the group of five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov-Marorov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, triumphed in the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he also had successes in the NHL: playing with Detroit won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Glory Hall.
Hyundai met the requirements of the unions. He'll cancel all the extra work.
The management of the automobile factory in Noovice agreed with the unions to cancel all the supplementary work.
Precisely because of the frequent extra work, the unions declared the strike emergency on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vank, the spokesman for the Hyundai automotive factory.
The management, however, wants to agree with the unions on a more Saturday shift this year.
We cannot resign from our manufacturing plan, as it is essential. That is why we proposed voluntary additional work for Saturday, December 19, that is, two shifts will be worked on, Vank said.
According to the Sedmika.cz server, the company offered a 400 CZK bonus to employees working on Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaka, the company decided to change the way it motivates its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for overtime or can take a day off on December 28, that is, extend the Christmas holidays in one day, Vank said.
In addition, all Saturday's shift employees will receive money for the trip and food.
Because the extra work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of the trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the management yesterday afternoon immediately decided to cancel all the additional work for the month of December, Vank mentioned.
Car factory employees were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory management and trade unionists is due on Monday morning.
Trade union chief Petr Kucha' said on Wednesday that if they committed to meeting the requirements and signing the document, they are willing to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation at the auto factory worsened last week on Wednesday, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for frequent additional work.
They also protested poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
Management said employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The trade unionists, in their declaration of Monday's strike emergency, also demanded that none of the employees, who last Wednesday interrupted manufacturing, be penalized in any way.
As far as supplementary work is concerned, the unions demand that the company minimise it.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 kronor for this work.
The automobile factory in Noovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Serial manufacturing was launched last November.
Until last September, it manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in the 'encalled' HIV virus
Team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some already accessible medicines.
AIDS disease cannot be cured until now.
However, patients' lives can be significantly prolonged by a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, the drugs no longer work.
The work of the experts from three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VoCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They found that substances called metalcarbors have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metalocarbers are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently from all the drugs used today, and that's why they can solve the resistance problem.
In their work, scientists find new, improved - compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the albumin of the virus.
Metalocarbons have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A traitor and resistant virus
HIV proteasis is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV proteasis, HIV virus fractionation does not occur and mature and virus corpuscles would not be created.
If we stop HIV proteasis, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which is still systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of HIV proteasis substances was tested, as well as against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metalhoraseans on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which the drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications make metalocarbors interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective HIV drugs, says Pavlína "ezá"ová, the head of the laboratory of structural biology at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics in Academy of Science.
Fight the budget. SDGs attacked Fischer, he defends himself
SDG chief Mirek Topolánek said the budget approved for next year is "appalling" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should, he says, think about its future existence.
SDG statements were pointed out by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say time is left for analysis.
SDG Vice-President Petr Neas said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of SSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Neas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies he wants to rely on the minority, which tries to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and the social democity towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Neas warned.
Yesterday the Chamber of Deputies approved the 2010 budget, however, with the proposed amendments by the left, for more than 12 billion kronor.
The House of Representatives raised the money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed SDG proposals, as they coverly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should rule with the 163 billion kronor deficit.
SDGs before the vote came out of the room and thus fulfilled the government's desire, that the modified budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disillusionment and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of the disappointment and feeling of futility; Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will reassess the current situation.
Neas is convinced that if Janota would seriously threaten resignation in the event of the approval of the modifier proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to Eská televize Janota asked for a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He said he's thinking about staying in the role.
The reason is his disappointment at the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Neas in the government they have nothing to do the nominees for the SSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The prime minister should also say clearly, whether he will resign, whether the House passes other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to sickness, income subsidies, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: SDG-nominated ministers are not to blame
It's the issue of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
Ministers nominated for the SDG have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the US text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in lieutenant positions there are people who belong to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Neas stressed, if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the struggle with the height of the public finances deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct, that it is based on the leftist majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies."
However, this cannot be supported and tolerated by SDG members.
"I have not thought about that, when the time comes, I will take care of it," Defense Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the members of the SDG, told reporters in the Chamber of Deputies.
Prime Minister Fischer in the afternoon left for a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
SDGs yielded at the request of the Prime Minister
Neas stressed that on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies he would probably vote against the modified budget, if the Prime Minister does not explicitly ask SDG Members to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, he reacted to the question, if SDGs do not care about the absence of the party leader in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the budget negotiations.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
Upon resigning from the mandate, he knew that in the following months it was mainly Bolshevism of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new train schedule of D, fewer trains will circulate at almost the same fares
Skahé dráhy (Cheel Railways) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some less used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, reinforce some links.
The total length of traffic will be reduced by two per cent compared to today, after the new train schedule enters into force.
Most rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will gain for example the inhabitants of the Ostravsko region, Drahy for this line will add a pendolino carrotary.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not travel to Bratislava again.
On the Prague - Písek line - the bust will circulate fewer fast trains, the direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in transport planned by Drahy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tábor - .eské Budjovice and some fast trains on the Prague line - Písek - Bud-jovice will be reduced only to a few days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new Milovice direct line to Prague, Milovice's inhabitants have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the surroundings of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line of Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance links to the capital will end at Prague station Hlavní nádra-í.
D will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to .umperk/Jeseník will circulate every two hours.
From December 13, travelers will not travel to Bratislava in Pendolino again.
This year's regional rail account: 200 million more than before
Fast trains are commissioned and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, to cover so-called demonstrable losses Dráhy will receive four billion kronor in total next year, just as this year. Local trains are commissioned by the regions, next year they will pay eight billion kronor in total, and the state will help them almost three billion.
Regional trains are more expensive this year.
For fast trains and Dráhy locals they have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always one year.
Dráhy is happy with the system, and perhaps that's why the prices of a vast majority of tickets didn't rise.
Changes will occur only in one-day tickets - D Net and cheap internet tickets eLi-ka.
For customer cardless travelers the price of D Net will increase from 450 kronor to 600 kronor.
The price of eLiaka will depend on the distance, so far there has been the single price of 160 kronor for trips between any two regional cities.
Philippine armies continue to stop more than 50 people, children released
The armed men have kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines today, including several primary school students and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only 65 kidnapped.
All 17 children arrested and a teacher were released after eight hours.
The abduction took place in the South Agusan province.
They say about 19 gunmen use the hostages as a live shield in the escape to the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree to hand over the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the armed members belong to the New People's Army (NPA), an armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, police previously chased the kidnappers because of the violence, the cause of which was the adjustment of the accounts between two clans of local families.
In the southern Philippines in Maguindanao province, it was due to the recent massacre, in which 57 people died, imposed on martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, related to the governor's elections, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this province in the south of the Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty, were arrested.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
But on Tuesday they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government.
RSA's story refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
In the coming days a new Hollywood film, by Clint Eastwood Invictus, will be released in American cinemas (its official title in Czech is Invictus: Neporaen), which captures part of the biography of former President of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose years ago for the leading role.
The second role, that of legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere are born of the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Its full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, together with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
High hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when preparations for the world championship in football are completed in the Republic of South Africa. At the same time, the media is shaken by alarming news about growing racial hatred and discrimination against people by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, reactions to this new film at RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the leading roles for Hollywood's "little interesting" stars.
Morgan Freeman says he is proud of the new film, however.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well to play it.
"Many times I met Nelson Mandela in person, to - as it is said - to collect his energy," he said in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if through the film we can remember Mandela's character and message.
"It's a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it's all about the world," he added.
In the rugby national team's suit
The film is based on the book of British writer John Carlin with the freely translated title In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. He portrays South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of people, racially and for long years apart. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as the protagonist also puts on the South African national rugby team's suit and enters the pitch. RSA won the World Cup at the time.
For entering the grammar in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great ovations, especially from the white audience and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship may be able to help people come together and form a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if the tense situation in the RSA improves.
White South Africans are nonetheless skeptical, as one rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain, said in an interview for LN.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko burns a transformer worth tens of millions of kroner
The fire has caught a transformer of the Eeps company in a switch box near the village of V.kov in Lounsko in the morning.
According to Luká Marvan, the firefighters' spokesman for the region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Earlier firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by the fire, however they later changed their minds and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and special extinguishing matter.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were none injured, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company's spokeswoman, the breakdown does not endanger the safe functioning of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million kronor, listing it exactly won't be possible before the fire goes out.
According to Mandatova, it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
During the ten years of Eeps' activity nothing similar happened, the breakdowns of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the spokeswoman for the company "EZ for the northern Czechnesk," the supplies of the electricity were not cut, and the fire of the electric substation did not affect the operation of homes, offices or companies.
A.s. Eeps posoní in the territory of the Czech Republic as an exclusive maintainer of the distributive system, of the electric conduction of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It keeps in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electric power of the transmission system to the distribution system, and also maintains the electric conduction 4339 kilometers long.
Janáura will file a slander complaint against three hetm of SSD
The owner of Student Agency Radim Janáura today will file a complaint for slandering three social democratic hetm.
These are Michal Haek of the Jihomoravsk-kraj region, Radko Martínek of Pardubick- kraj and the hetman of Olomouck. kraj Martin Tesaík.
Janura mentioned it in Twenty minutes on Radio-urnál.
Demand has to do with the company's effort, to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with Eeské dráhy.
All three hetmans are attacking us and they talk about the fact that we are "taking the raisins from the cake," however we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim, we are more expensive than I was dráhy, which is not true. We know the prices of Eeské dráhy, which were set last week.
So we have nothing left to defend ourselves.
It is because of the slander towards the Student Agency society, he said for Radio-urnál Janáura.
He mentioned at the same time having the evidence from all regions. According to him, they have not taken necessary measures in line with European law.
That is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Consider this complaint for the continuation of Mr Janáura's follow-up media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Naturally I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other hetmen to do so as well.
I suppose, on this occasion it will also be clearly demonstrated, that Mr Janáura manipulates the public in the regional rail transport issue, and uses lying and false arguments, Ha'ek mentioned.
Janáura announced last week that she would invest several million kronor in advertising, which would be to warn of these measures in the regions.
Radio-Anurinál told him that he would disrupt the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will be carried out against the corupn as such.
Janáura started the campaign after the regions agreed with the region to hold regional rail links and to commission approximately 150 billion kronor they did not call for a site.
According to Janura, similar steps are at odds with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Janáura claims to have been threatened by a SSD Member, due to his criticism of fero-travel transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we don't leave it, we can lose the bus licenses.
"Stage, I know, what sir it is, I'm not going to say your name," Jan'ura said today for Radio-urnál.
Pneumoccal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumoccal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As a first vaccine it should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, opinions already appear, that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumoccal vaccine are completed.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January, children born since 2 August last year will be able to receive the pneumoccal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is not to have received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine has to be received between the third and fifth month of age of a child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily allowed their children to vaccinate against pneumococcals.
Parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 kronor and more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate younger children.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend on vaccines of 300 to 450 thousand kronor each year.
Without clutching they will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far the state has spent approximately 500 thousand annually on all vaccinations for children.
The covered vaccination was started by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also serious infections including meningitis and septicaemia.
Of pneumococsal infections in our country every year, according to research in hospitals on 28 children not older than 10 years of age die.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the pneumoccal vaccine cover in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
However, at the same time there are opinions, that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
Starting in January it must be covered by insurance companies and volunteers.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, said Rudolf Kalovsk, the head of the Nahlas civic association.
Their association has been spreading pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
Experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not entirely ideal.
On the other hand we are happy, to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path we now have to take, Kalovsk said.
The Ministry of Health does not, however, want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcal.
"At the moment we do not think about it at all," said his spokesman Vlastimil Sr.e.
Voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors say
The president of the pediatrician society Odborná spole.nost praktick.ch d.tsk.ch léka. Hana Cabrnochová recognizes that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children receive the vaccine, it will be possible to reason on the reduction in the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as a volunteer," Cabrnochová says.
Experts hope that from next year more than 80 percent of young parents will leave their babies vaccinated against pneumococcals.
The pneumoccal vaccine is a big change too because since the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save on treatment later, Cabrnochová explains.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are worried about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some MPs, however, were afraid that insurance companies could "take money out of health insurance."
Doctors will therefore have to buy the vaccines and wait, until they are paid for by insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in 40,000 vaccines per month, which is a remarkable sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved "in the theft of a museum"
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings valued at 20 million U.S. dollars (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught while loading 90 frames in his vehicle and trailer.
They claim Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta Sr., 81, is famous for his portrayal of characters such as Conan the Barbara and Tarzan.
The Associated Press news agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police official said a family dispute may have motivated the young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta, 52, told police that his father had ordered him to "enter the museum by any means to move all the paintings to a warehouse."
The agency said Frazetta Sr. denied granting such permission.
Labour party defends budget tax rises
Ministers have defended tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, in the face of criticism from the opposition, businesses and unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling "wasted" an opportunity to show his seriousness about cutting the deficit, delaying decisions until after the election.
The finance minister also faced harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are an increase of 0.5 per cent in social security expenditure and a ceiling of 1 per cent in public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
Unions have lamented that low-wage workers are punished with a recession generated by others, and warned of future "problems."
The increase in Social Security spending, which will grow by around three billion pounds a year, has angered the business community, which claims this is a jobs tax, when the focus should be on the economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than 20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
CLAVES PUNTOS OF THE ANTERIOR REPORT To the BUDGET
Social security with an increase of an additional 0.5 per cent, from April 2011
Economy will contract more than expected 4.75 per cent this year
New 50 percent tax on bankers' bonds
One-point rise in corporate tax for small firms ruled out
Tax breaks for electric cars and wind turbines
The state pension would increase by 2.5 per cent
According to the estimates of the Ministry of Finance, a person earning 30,000 will lose 90 per year and whoever wins 40,000 will lose 190, while a person who earns 10,000 per year will earn 110.
Ministers said their target of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60 per cent of the extra tax burden would fall on 5 per cent of the highest wages.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that tax rises and delineated spending cuts were a "grain of sand in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are big figures. It will allow us to halve the deficit, which is absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labour party's forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence the amount to borrow and how quickly the deficit is reduced, have been called into question after the finance minister was forced to change the early figures.
In his statement, he said the economy would likely contract by 4.75 per cent this year, much worse than the 3.5 percent decline forecast in April, while borrowing would be $3 billion above the previously estimated.
"Wriken opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning of the Labour party's "debt crisis," said the projection of borrowing applications for $789 billion over the next six years was unsustainable.
Ministers had failed to come up with a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, "cyclingly" dodging the difficult options until after the election due in June 2010.
"They haven't included anything significant about what they will do," Finance Ministry shadow minister Philip Hammond said. "They had the opportunity to do it and they've wasted it."
All major ads will be made after the election, win whoever wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour party insists that schools, hospitals and police from future cuts will be protected, unlike the Conservative proposals, which would seek further short-term deficit reduction.
But the Liberal Democrats said the money raised by tax rises and spending cuts would be used to sustain spending next year, not to reduce the deficit, arguing the projects were like "sand breaks."
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the timing of the announcements, such as rising inflation from some disability subsidies next April, mentioned above, would leave the finance minister exposed to allegations of election maneuvers, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour party insists that people are being provided more in need and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Fake budget"
Although ministers did not publish the post-2011 spending data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Finance Minister's figures involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including future transport, higher education, science and defence.
"This is really putting the pain off later," said its director, Robert Chote.
"All major ads will come after the election, win whoever wins," added Roger Bootle, an economic consultant for Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been the false pre-budget report. The markets realise this.'
FBI inquires into "detentions of Americans in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia, USA, last month.
The U.S. Foreign Ministry said it was also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are reported to be of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If they are American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been arrested and what kind of circumstances they are being held," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if in effect they are the students who were missing," the spokeswoman said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
He said the house was already in the sights of the local police and that no charges had yet been laid against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, the Reuters news agency reported, but said the U.S. had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure it continues to recruit and train people."
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian 'abuses'
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been just as poor, according to a report by campaign group Amnesty International.
The report details "the models of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
A man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials have said such criticism has a political foundation.
The thousands of people arrested and the dozen killed in Iran after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election sparked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"Falsa confession"
Amnesty International cited the account of Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer science student, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the election result.
"I'm often punched in the face" according to his words.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me.'
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and released him and left in the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the rape allegations, but admitted there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed he was held in a container along with 75 others for more than eight weeks at a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the discomfort of the post-election and response, but said the mandate and powers of the agencies were confusing and the inquiries of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was done in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow was used to turn a Bristol site of interest into a racing track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short jump ramp, in front of a 100-metre-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was quite frightening.
You can see it under a beautiful view of the lights of the city titillating.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, real talent," he added.
The prizes were awarded to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After Thursday afternoon's event, the snow will be melted.
Still them and us.
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and when there is a widespread warning about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating) into one of the continent's most openly secular societies.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work Why do the French don't like veils" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr.'s last book. Bowen has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide France's 5-6 million Muslims with what Mr. Bowen calls Islamic spaces."
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students about the questions that interest them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should they teach young Muslims about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, things of daily life, that worry the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab Muslim scholar.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't manage to spread this argument altogether.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr. Bowen has a disagreement with his counterparts in Salafi, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
He questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite who so fiercely defends secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are likely to have a more unfair treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, he perceives an adjustment of values."
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say yes, but not yet."
The world's most desolate picture
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have focused on newly opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now perpetrators, as a result.
In "On Thin Ice"""" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Knowing the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave evidence of courage by confronting the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter as a brave 14-year-old cadet, struggling only with the end of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The young, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were trapped and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation in the early 20th century, he exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still usually a millionth of the area of a wild adult. The weather is almost never right: a Singapore-based polar bear went green by the algae growing inside the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis resorts to stories of other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, the US and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and Eskimo Indians on snowmobiles use high-powered assault rifles to knock down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters to the north of those two hunting nations that the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and an overwhelming look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It's not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of changes.
It's not for lack of effort.
The pioneering trips of Fridtjof Nansen in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave evidence for the first time about the displacement of ice masses.
Then the Cold War submarines drew a map of the moving ice cords circulating under the ice masses.
Satellite scans and extensive series of probes mounted on the icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks inside the extraordinary, tiny world of the affluent system inside Arctic ice, formed by drips of saline water that compresses as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all doomed once summer ice is removed, what is believed to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines among the 6,000 laying wreaths in Arlington graves
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood in their boots.
"In a few months, from where they're boarding us, these could be us," Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd want someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to place wreaths at the veterans' graves in several sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, started the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves at Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to soldiers and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a nonprofit, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, areas of the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City and at the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and carry the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a career-dead soldier.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was his way of giving retribution to those who made sacrifices.
"This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops," he said.
It's like visiting a family tomb.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked through the graveyard's wide meadows and hills.
Volunteers headed to older graves of World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, because they don't get as many visits as new graves, organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couple held hands, as they carried the cool pine to the gravestones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red loop tied to the top.
Nearby, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the bleak atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the glacial air.
Some read loud names sculpted on the stones, while others leaned in to see small black and white plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from her eyes in front of her son's grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of Navy gunner Sgto. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
"No one should ever forget why we are free." my son paid for it," he said.
"A lot after my death I want someone to remember it."
Cuban officials arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, is working for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
Specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything considered "dangerous."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include mild protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an incipient blogger community, run by popular commentator Yoani Sanchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sanchez has requested several opportunities permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but the permit has been denied to him.
The arrest of a U.S. contractor could likely lead to tensions between the Castro brothers' communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a "slow pace" approach to improving relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to release the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mainly used for text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost daily wages.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes like drug trafficking.
Berbena said she could not provide further information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly misguided.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as distributing free mobile phones, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the program of the Americas of the organization Human Rights Watch, which recently published a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro," itself Cuba, a reference to the location of Raúl Castro as leader of the country, to replace his sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, prosecuted and jailed in one day.
He said any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unravel plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who travel the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
Investigators said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube Internet video site.
Saifullah led the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah was unable to convince al Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
They were therefore isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke from anonymity due to the delicacy of the case.
The official said the men did not change and were even trying to get proper approval to access al Qaeda camps, when Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determine who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to infiltrate people into al Qaeda.
The organizers act as guards, not letting go of those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to holy war, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said al Qaeda is looking at aspiring American recruits with special attention.
But for the organization they represent enormous appeal, because of its potential to have access to American goals and because of its propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about those they admit, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become adept at their recruitment methods.
"If you're trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than following the recruitment model what have already been followed?" Kohlmann said.
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate "action"
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets demanding negotiators working at the city's Bella Center Convention Center, more audacious action for the weather.
Protesters said 100,000 people took part in the event, but police estimated the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, though a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city holding banners in English that said "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish declaring, "The Earth says "enough is enough."
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said the trips Peru, her mother's home country, made me aware of the distressing issues the country has to deal with because of the impacts of climate changes already taking place. "
"This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement," he said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it any longer.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
Under Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified because he was involved in the climate talks, activists wearing sports masks and black outfits planted several explosives near the main Copenhagen canal, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started as flames, but were followed by "a couple of large explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around TV screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not appear to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I wasn't really aware of the situation."
Then he kept saying in Mandarin, "As the meeting place is great, I can't hear what happens outside."
He said it was up to each other's perspective to define whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the general public and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they affect negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Evidence shows lingering racial differences
Last week's federal ratings notebook on math performance was very good news for the Capital District's public schools.
Although the District is still far from the best-performing systems in the country, the grade notebook showed that fourth- and eighth graders slipped at a faster pace over the past two years, compared to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in recent figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent achievement gap between African American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of D.C. white fourth-grade students over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but their African American peers rose by just three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance gap grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of eighth-grade African Americans remained essentially flat, dropping a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average scores of the whites were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year span, the picture is no more encouraging.
The difference between white and white fourth-grader students in 2003, when the first ENPE in the District was released, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the gap has barely narrowed to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as advances made by Rector Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democratic) was driven largely by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the set by serving those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, D.C."s chief executive. Voice, a nonprofit that advocates for educational equity in the District.
"I'm not leaping for joy for a two- or three-point difference," D.C. Council member Kwame R said. Brown (Dem.-By Accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Eaton Elemental.
Brown, a regular-minded Rhee's management style critic, said the message of the test scores is that the city's high schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect it.
But what worries is that we are not devoting the time or energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performing students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper grades of primary and middle school, who did not master the basics of early reading in their school years and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday math, a math curriculum from kindergarten to sixth grade, that emphasizes real-life games and experiences, which was introduced in the District under former superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by ENPE last week.
"I just think we need to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the grade level," Rhee said.
Others say ENPE's results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-yielding schools, which will be needed to narrow the gap.
Here's some sort of scathing dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California at Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The solution to conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administration reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
Then the goal can generate political repercussions that go against that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she tries to hold on to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to ending the performance difference is lengthening the traditional public school year, now 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It takes nearly 200 days to get the strength of change, said Janey, who struck a deal with her teachers' union last year in a 185-day year, which she considers an "indicator" to seek a bigger increase in the next agreement.
Make higher education a share of more future
The tour bus arrived at Gettysburg University with a strong stir.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, came down and blinked for a moment in front of the white columns, brick facades and emerald meadows.
Graciela's parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Still, when she and the group's other eighth-graders explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
Oh, yes. "Here's where I'll be," exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
"How's serious?" he said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the school's low teacher-student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children had visited on their three-day trip, and had already completely absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you're going to college.
The question is which one.
While there is growing concern about the large number of U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access the college education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second-generation" Hispanics graduate to university, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country's workforce.
Analysing the highest-performing say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high targets for their children and find ways to make up for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But mentoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Watching low-income children whose parents don't have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time won't solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these kids, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the Graciela University tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems, to run college readiness programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue until high school is over.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 deals that the Iraqi Oil Ministry struck with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in restoring Iraq's oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies moved away having bid in just two of the 10 auctioned sites.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who filed an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for deposits auctioned in June.
The poor representation of the US oil giants in the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the forefront, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will be a long time before anything else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated shelling on Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military retreats, likely prevented U.S. oil companies from taking more forceful risk in Iraq, which has the world's third-largest crude stockpile, analysts said.
U.S. companies were at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only U.S. companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major US firms such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have strengthened ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, have moved away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Petroleum Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered more contracts than any other company and secured large investments in contracts for two main sites.
We know that China is on track to become a major economic and technological powerhouse, Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will fulfill its commitments to Iraq.
The companies shortlisted to submit proposals made offers that then faced the barrel subsidy that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels at each site.
Al Qaeda's top planner has been apparently killed in Pakistan
An alleged U.S. missile attack on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a major al Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men believed to have died on Tuesday when a pair of missiles hit his car near the city of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, the type operated by the CIA inside Pakistan's illegal tribal area.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, a Pakistani civilian intelligence agency official said, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The official said the suspected local militants rushed to the site and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally shattered bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a senior al Qaeda military planner who led the terrorist group's operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He dedicated himself to conspiring around the world, said a senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of U.S. airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Considering his central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks on the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide to al Qaeda's top command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had risen quickly in the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
"It may not be a known name for some Americans, but that does not in any way diminish the threat it posed to us and our allies," the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, he would be the second leader of al Qaeda or Taliban leader to be killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking officers.
The pace of unmanned CIA-led aircraft strikes has slowed since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a recount of The Long War Journal, a website run by a nonprofit organization.
The decrease is perhaps due to an enhanced tactic by terrorist groups, who have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site said.
Top UN envoy in Kabul about to resign
The top U.N. envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign from his post in March, ending a tumultuous mandate that was hurt by allegations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan's U.N.-backed presidential election.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send about 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supports the increase, but is concerned that the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal that begins in 18 months will prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
"We need to speed up the readiness of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans so they can trust the international community," Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, who will cooperate with Afghanistan's political transition.
The increase in the military sector needs to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the secretary
U.N. General Ban Ki-moon, so he would have time to find a replacement.
"What I said is that they better start looking for a successor," Eide said.
When I got here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
Ban has begun seeking a replacement, according to U.N. officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the U.N. mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led U.N. peace missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was put to the test before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said the allegations of Galbraith, who was fired, "surely harmed the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate aid efforts by U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also pushed the U.N. leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries, which lend themselves to the Afghan mission, saying this would increase their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations of his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that cumbersome UN hiring regulations undermine his ability to attract talents.
"So this is how the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May," he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't go on.
Gates: Iran to face additional sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" against Iran, for its failure to hold talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that, if we've learned anything from Iraq over the last six years, it's the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran's military and political elite, but Gates said some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population as a whole.
He argued that "a package of incentives and disincentives" would be necessary, "to persuade the Iranian government that they would be really less safe with nuclear weapons," because "their people will suffer enormously" the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face "credible" consequences if its nuclear program does not fully respect the directions of the U.N. Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated he would re-negotiate on restricting his nuclear program and agree to leave a substantial part of his stockpile of enriched uranium, in exchange for the desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such a deal, as a way to build trust between the two sides and gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to have moved away from the tempting agreements, in part, experts say, because the Iranian command is divided over the possibility of committing to the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran's hardening with the international community on some proposals they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline of December 31 for Iran to respond to the proposals, before rethinking other options, including continuing what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "devastating sanctions."
In a statement in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called on Thursday "unsubstantiated and baseless accusations," on the part of some Security Council members about Iran's nuclear activities, and said it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the Kurdish oil-rich region of Iraq to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and co-participation.
Gates urged both sides to diminish the potential for conflict, to avoid any delays in U.S. projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to ease Kurdish anxiety about pending reduction. U.S. officials quoted Gates' words as saying to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We won't abandon them."
In an ageing China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that lectured them about the fact that "Mer Earth is too tired to support more children" and "one more baby means one more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that, when Shanghai government officials alarmed by the low birth rate and aging population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We've given all our time and energy just for a child.
"We have nothing left for a second," said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after China's one-child policy was introduced, creating two generations of notoriously chubby children, one-off children, affectionately nicknamed "small emperors," a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six of when the policy became effective, according to the Division
UN demographics, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population by 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with very cultured populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people ages 60 and older accounted for nearly 22 percent of registered Shanghai residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, said fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and mitigate future labour shortages."
Shanghai is about to be "so old (not so rich, though) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual relief
Drafted in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and employment discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for their contribution to avoiding critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights advocates have denounced abuses in the imposition of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had abortions based on the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-female proportion.
In recent years, population officials have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife are unique children, and in 2007 they downplayed many of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University's Institute for Demographic Research, said central government officials have recently been discussing even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, the posters ordering families to have a single child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be ideal for having a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officers and volunteers to visit couples at their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very unbe overwhelming.
Disappointing response
While officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai argue that they saw a moderate increase in requests from couples who want a second child after the campaign launch, the more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to reach only about 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee at Caolu Township in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want any more children.
They want to give their first child the best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally empowered to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only the insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social safety net, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West see the one-child policy incorrectly as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
Yeah, they're stealing the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she wants an only child because she was, too: "We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We're not used to caring for others and we don't really want to take care of others. "
Chen Zijian, 42, who owns a translation agency, explained it more forcefully.
For parents with two middle-class careers, who reduce the birth rate, he said, it's about being successful enough to be selfish.
People between the ages of 20 and 30 grew up watching their parents' struggle during the early days of China's experiment with capitalism and don't want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child takes a lot of parent time, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "they have to remodel their apartment," and the strategist "has to have a curriculum prepared for the best nurseries when the child is 9 months old."
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN panel outlines plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, which has so far been challenged positions and mutual recriminations, drew renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that foresees ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Developed by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not speak of how much money rich countries would give to the poor to face global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of the overall temperature rise that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
"This gives a lot of flexibility to the process," said John Coequyt, Washington's top representative for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote the six-page document, summed up a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the top U.N. climate official, Yvo de Bóer, described as "the big picture."
It shows the profiles for a possible deal, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce theirs over the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also spurred talks on Friday, pledging to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same kind of verbal fireworks that dominated the conversations last week was presented.
U.S. special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected claims that call for mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies if not funded by the developed world.
The move indicated that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China, on what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not make an agreement without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said America's top climate negotiator lacked "common sense," or was "very irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's leading powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the bravest action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the major powers are discussing who should pay for the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to contain the large emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also works as regional climate change advisor for Mexico and Central America, for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, even if most major participants say the talks will produce a political agreement at most.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States drafted a proposal for a 24-page preliminary treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate talks on behalf of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now unified and demand action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most exceptional issues before heads of government come to close a deal.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, descended from the planes and rushed to the corridors of the Bella Center, to closed meetings and press conferences, in order to delimit the claims that will be made over the next week.
The absolute mess of the meeting (where 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center every day, activists who play guitar present night shows mocking the countries that are being sold, and preliminary proposals are passed from hand to hand instead of via email), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global conservation policy.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first 225kmh train redefines that sentiment on Monday
At 5.13am on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to mark a train exit that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country's first high-speed intercity train will reach 225kmh, when it passes like lightning from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometres in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Secretary, will then be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes, aboard the first Javelin intercity service outside London.
He hopes that the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become thriving suburbs, business travel times would be shortened and switching planes and cars to rail would reduce national coal emissions, as well as ease congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears over environmental damage, can still curb Britain's high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the Government with a feasibility study, will hand over its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times heard.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the Midlands of the West will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a 25-metre radius of a final route.
HS2 is also expected to set up three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the Midlands of the West.
The line would be split in or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would go into Scotland.
Does this look like this will be the most beneficial option," said one member of the railway.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which would not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402kmh, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to support 400 mt-long trains, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means it would take a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Considering the capital's space restrictions, an existing station is expected to be expanded to fit the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say only St Pancras International or Euston station offer that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes the scheme should proceed, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean a final decision will not be made until after a general election.
Even if you start the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
Trains would initially be forced to leave fast lines on existing lanes north of Birmingham, keeping journey times between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point needed to ensure a switch from aircraft to trains, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers face the mortgage for an orange of 75,000 of a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the Conservative Party's spokesman, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange tree he built in his constituency home.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs lived on rations," increased his mortgage by 75,000 to build an oak-framed extension at his second home in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to take extra interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons authorities approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who is leading a review of members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan said the requests could not be clearer or simpler."
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest MPs, owns a two-storey house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
Nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described on the planes as an "orange."
Neighbors described it as a greenhouse for entertainment."
Mr. Duncan to make no reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent inquiry by the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges on its previous mortgage deals.
Last month the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of 271,406 pounds from his London property to his constituency home, which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became an MP.
Documents released this week show Mr. Duncan was seeking about 1,400 pounds a month in mortgage interest, until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Royal Bank of Scotland's mortgage Duncan did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase would fund the loan of 75,000 pounds.
The standard variable mortgage rate of BRE fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March this year, a rate it is now at.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan was still asking for $1,250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as opposition president of the House in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him saying deputies had to survive rations" after the expenses scandal.
Is this basically nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated as m**rda."
He said: "I spend my money in my garden and request a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for much more, but I don't. "
The deputy, a millionaire for his former profession as an oil trader, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this could be considered excessive."
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the tyracil symbol on Mr. Duncan in protest after it was revealed he applied for 4,000 pounds over three years.
Last night, when asked about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said: "Was it for primary improvements, approved by both the salary office and later by Legg."
He added: "Isn't it about avoiding and committing a crime or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It could not be in any way clearer or simpler."
Come those who have faith, to see the advent calendar of the palapa of Brighton beach
Brighton palapas have found a new boost for the winter months in an interactive advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each day of December, using carols as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests who could see the last palapa from 5.30pm to 6.30pm every day, with stuffed cakes and free punch.
The carols chosen so far include Vi Tres Boats, Oh Come, Oh Come, Emanuel and The First Christmas, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a Hove TV marketing assistant, is an unpaid cleric from the Diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a society of post-Christianity."
"Why do we hope as a Church that people will come to a strange old building? I believe that the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
The idea of the Palapa Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to test and represent that through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested Saturday in demand of an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested several hundred people.
Some thirty thousand people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded for the icy Danish capital in demand of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change will have to reach by Friday no later than Friday. It would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents erupted shortly after the demonstration began in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke windows with cobblestones and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
Riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, they are especially members of the Black Bloks," ultra-violent groups who had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were arrested "without distinction," stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized in the street on Saturday night handcuffed and sitting despite the intense cold."
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, the venue of the negotiations.
Protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to enter.
A stage was raised to welcome guest speakers. The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelight vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by coach and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Korean, were also present as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most of them with celestial raincoats responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue seas" for "justice and climate."
"Today we take to the streets to ask for compensation for the green debt in favour of the South," said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
"We can't keep saying: there's time," said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are dry rivers, watercourses through which you can walk as never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure in the anti-globalisation, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world."
The Asia Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands that are highly vulnerable to warming, gave the initial wings wings.
According to the organizers, some 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded dressed in red and wearing headscarves with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as Canada, there were cents of the training of hundreds of protesters calling for strong action against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
The separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
On Saturday, Georgia's pro-Russian separatist region recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud."
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
Polling stations closed at 5pm GMT.
According to the heads of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission, the turnout was 58 per cent hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on Saturday night to Sunday.
The five candidates in the race, including the outgoing president, Sergea Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of vote counting.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheel Saakachvili "believes that Abkhazia has fallen under total Russian occupation," said its spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
Following its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia is trying to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
"This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state," Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, told AFP, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who headed to the polling station at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a nice white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large boards show Bagapch next to Russian president and prime minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district's chief, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed Russian officials who came to control the development of the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: "We, the people of Abkhazia, thank the support of Moscow, and particularly the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
"I hope that his country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations," said Alexe Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising his glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that cedes control of the Abkhaz railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, maintains that he does not support the current power or the opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a runoff will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: Worldwide demonstrations, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement to the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where police, on alert, detained more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Some thirty thousand people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded in the afternoon in the midst of the cold of the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that will have to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
The demonstration, which is very peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
Protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, not trying to enter.
A stage was raised to welcome guest speakers. The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelight vigil.
A few moments after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
Riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them to the floor.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs," ultraviolent groups who had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw with a cobblestone, and four cars were set on fire near a busy house during the incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to police.
Extremist groups did not take their eyes off, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as law enforcement helicopters flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by coach and train from the big cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Korean, were also present as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most of them with celestial raincoats responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue seas" for "justice and climate."
"Today we take to the streets to ask for compensation for the green debt in favour of the South," said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

The Oxfam organization, along with former UN commissioner for refugees, Mary Robinson, who was due to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands that are highly vulnerable to warming, gave the initial wings wings.
According to the organizers, about 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, showed dressed in red and wearing headscarves with pro-solo energy slogans in front of the City Hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, the formations of hundreds of protesters demanding action against climate change were formed.
In France, demonstrations organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).

The subject of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, said in an interview that it will be broadcast in the Sunday Information (JDD, according to his French acronym) that history and geography would be "strengthened" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific baccalaureate.
From now on, all high school students will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, Chatel says.
For the Minister, "they are enough with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "straweth C is no longer a scientific branch," but "in general, it summons the best students."
The General and Literary Teaching branches cannot be sub-patust of C, he continues to stress even: "I didn't hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged at having eliminated history and geography in the second grade in technology schools."
A FIFG poll published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that about seven French people in ten (69 per cent) disapproved of the government's project to eliminate compulsory history-geography education in second grade C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected right-wing representatives also criticized this fact.
Instead, the minister added that "there is no talk" of removing philosophy from the C-grade high school program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a mobilization day on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will give an admissions test that will aim for their discipline, and by the end of the year, an admissions test on their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will also do internships under real conditions during the year of M2, then will be a first year in front of the classroom as internship teachers.
If you make all the practices proposed prior to the contest, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education."
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012."
At the Higher Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to discuss the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge accepted on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street Higher Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize winner, inaugurated the conference wheel "Ernest," a day composed of a series of fifteen-minute presentations of experts, filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist reported.
We wanted to do something that would appeal to people and give them a desire to know more, explained in the framework of the conference Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish from the school pond.
We chose about twenty participants from the experts of their discipline and selected them on their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, "we can talk hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel, who exhibited without notes, told AFP, but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the public will understand that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific record."
Videos filmed during those conferences will be online on the school's website from December 15.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delay in payments: Disgust among prison guards, is expected to take action
Prison guard unions on Friday called for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the end-of-year holidays, premiums and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Prison Workers Force (2nd guard union) asked off-duty staff to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block them" to report theft of their assets.
The CGT (3rd union of the profession) calls them to "get together in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a massive mobilization," as it calls "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "extra hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first guard union, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and fury."
The Directorate of the Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased greatly in 2009 and not all were counted, but they claim that the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Chancellery reported that Michale Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I have no doubt about the efforts made by staff to operate and modernize our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I asked the Directorate of the Prison Administration to immediately implement a set of measures aimed at ensuring that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of overtime does not occur again in the future.
December pay will then be low, except for management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous performance and target premiums, and who "always blame the budget demands," the Ufap/Unsa deplored.
It is a real scandal, the FO interregional union of Marseille said, announcing its decision to boycott until further order "all meetings and convocations."
Staff will not come to work on Sundays and corresponding holidays if those in October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threatening FO Rh?ne-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the moment when our tasks and missions are increased without taking more troops, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the salary of the staff, the Bordeaux Prison CGT estimates.
According to trade unions, not in all regions the same thing happens, as some are luckier than others.
But either way, the result is not expected, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-Fransois Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first Christmas as a family in the White House, confessed to the famous television presenter, Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion about gifts: "I make better gifts than I receive."
During a special interview that the ABC network will broadcast on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the end-of-year holidays in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, will be the game.
Santa also loves Bo, Michelle Obama, said, clarifying that the dog will receive "of course" a gift, according to excerpts from the program passed in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts she receives: "No way, last year I gave you nice gifts," she said, prompting the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before answering with humor pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During the one-hour interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devoily supported Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also recalled their favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama recalled a two-speed bike, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who saw rarely, gave him for Christmas.
"I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball," the president said.
Just many years later, I found out he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her doll house.
"I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of settling them around the home, yet I adored that dollhouse," Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL claims he's in an induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was intervened again in Los Angeles due to significant "injuries" from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his relatives, while RTL claims the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was intervened again on the night from Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sina Hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors checked "injury resulting from the operation" of discal hernia carried out in Paris on November 26, said his press service in the same city, indicating that these injuries "need to have a restorative operation."
However, the singer's press service tried to convey reassurance by claiming that the situation was "under control," and reported that a new medical part would be reported within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, a sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications."
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will have more certainty about his condition, RTL adds.
The press service, questioned by the AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no cannule would have been introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the Monceau Park International Clinic due to a discal hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a doctor well known in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux declined to comment on the information broadcast by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday was admitted Monday to Cedars-Sina Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection resulting from the intervention carried out by Delajoux.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, Johnny Hallyday's close friend, explained Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time," but said he was not "a problem" because the rocker is "a fighter."
"He called me right before I traveled to Los Angeles, and I told him it was silly to get 12 hours of plane after such an operation, it's not possible," Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, sought to reassure by claiming that Johnny Hallyday "satisfactorily reacted to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled."
Camus said he had spoken to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and had not noticed any particular concerns.
But the singer's health problems multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed he had been operated on for a "colon cancer" after a mild infection.
In late September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Gira 66," presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been overly commented on. Fans and journalists noticed the musician's difficulties in moving on stage.
In mid-November, their relatives even had to deny a new internment.
Euro-2009/short pool: Bousquet's first title in his favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medallist in the World Cups, won an international title on Thursday in a distance for which he feels particular affection, 50m free, during Euro-2009 in short pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which polyurethane swims were last allowed, only three world records were exceeded when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in relay 4 x 50 m 4 styles (masculine).
A shame for Bousquet, who coveted the world record at 50m free, a brand he owns in a long pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances of swimming, in 50 m free, the 28-year-old Frenchman prevailed with 20'53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, a scoop at international level.
Bousquet went ahead of Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world mark (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I was going to try to achieve it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits that depart from January 1st will be banned.
These swimsuits, the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, end their epic in Istanbul, where they first competed in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of the swimsuits did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark by 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he prevailed with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), against Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself up in this race.
I knew I wasn't going to be able to break a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann said.
US: A sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola sold at $1.5 million
A panel of Roman sarcophagus belonging to French writer Emile Zola sold on Thursday at $1.5 million, well above the estimated price, the art dealer of Sotheby's announced.
This 2-metre-long, 63cm tall panel dates back to the third century after Christ, and its price had been estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four dioistic scenes, in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satires and drunk women, is an unusual piece, as there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It sold in a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most driven by buyers, no doubt, a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
Just a few days ago, marble was discovered to be an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathtub in her private Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the Third French Republic and president of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emie Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérsse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart."
Honduras aborted Zelaya's exit to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico estimated that the conditions were not given to transfer to its territory the ousted president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whom the coup government denied the safe conduct.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of carrying out the transfer, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Zelaya returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the General Directorate of Migration.
To grant him safe conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "resign" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the ousted president refused because he wanted to reach Mexico as head of state in a guest term.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my position (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in which he usually makes statements since the beginning of the political crisis that has been in the Central American country for five months.
"I can stay ten years here, I have my guitar," the deposed president, a refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months, added, "he said.
The Mexican embassy submitted an application for safe conduct, but unfortunately we could not accept it because we did not contain an asylum request, the interior minister of the coup government, Oscar Raúl Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
"I will not ask for asylum from any country," Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview on Telesur, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors about Zelaya's departure on Wednesday mobilized supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government's position.
This reflects the marginal nature of this government in the face of international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela's socialist president, Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, when he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will have to answer to the justice system for the crime of "high treason," according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial scrutiny, elected Porfirio Lobo. That election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until his term ends on January 27.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Thursday, U.S. trade balance figures are a faithful witness to the economic revival of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67%; and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, of technological component, 7.13 points reaching 2,190.06 points.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.58 per cent (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
"We got good news from different sectors of the economy," FTN Financial's Lindsey Piegza said.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the glass half full."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the U.S. trade balance figures, "which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6 percent in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the contrary, expected a deepening deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growth of trade volumes, particularly exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies they trade with the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
In contrast, unemployment in the United States unexpectedly increased last week, 474,000 applications were filed.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "was the lowest for a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market fell.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.492% against 4.408% the previous day.
Cuba: More than a hundred supporters of power boo the "Ladies of White"
On Thursday, hundreds of Cuban power supporters booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration that a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some forty "Ladies of White," wives or relatives of political prisoners, were attacked in the street by supporters of Raúl Castro's government as they walked to the center of the capital demanding the release of these detainees, said an AFP journalist.
The Yanks die, "Mercenaries," "The street belongs to the revolutionaries," "Long live Fidel and Raúl" the militants of power-winged the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes officers who came to "protect them."
The day before, a similar demonstration was unleashed against the "Ladies of White" in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for international human rights day, she was arrested by police officers dressed in civilian clothes, an AFP journalist reported.
The agents forcibly climbed the dissidents who were booed by government supporters, according to that journalist.
Overall, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances only last a few hours.
The "Ladies of White," awarded the 2005 Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners," about 200 according to dissent, said one of its leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom are still behind bars.
The Cuban authorities call the opponents "mercenaries" or "agents" on the salary of their declared enemy, the United States.
Made in the media, Cuban television reported Thursday's demonstration of government militants against the "counterrevolutionary."
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alien kills an octogenarian with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five others in the centre of the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Save of the Seine) on Thursday at the peak of the afternoon
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor allegedly hit with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, an old man, in or in front of the pharmacy on No. 85 of Jean-Jauris Boulevard, police sources and witnesses reported.
Following the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in hospital, according to a head of the Alliance police union.
Then at or in front of the pharmacy, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about 30 years old, got in the way and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the elderly man died.
The other injured's life, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
The pregnant woman then suffered a blackout and was admitted "in a state of shock," a police source said.
The armed man, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, reportedly escaped along Jean Jaurs Boulevard.
Apparently at random, he would have wounded two more pedestrians: a man in his thirties, and another of forty seriously.
In the evening, the crime scene was still uncleared.
He was armed with two butcher knives carrying crosses on his back, an Alliance union manager in the Seine Highlands, Arnaud Pressé, said on the spot.
Several passers-by, including young people, tried to control the alienated, according to the testimonies obtained by the AFP.
I saw a guy in his thirties with a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
"They didn't make it because the guy was strong," explained Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd kicked him out, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
On Jean-Jaura Boulevard, at number 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to arrest the armed man and were wounded, according to police testimonies.
The events took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous shops are located.
Some people came to tell me that there was a wounded man on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor. "When I put him in a safe position, I noticed a very significant wound to the abdomen," Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about 35 years old, arrived with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identity documents.
The Nanterre Prosecutor &apos; s Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the High Court of the Seine Judicial Police (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
During his pretrial detention he did not say a word.
A police source does not rule out the possibility of being placed in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to dominate him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "anything upset of this kind whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
US: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the case to be dismissed
The lawyer for Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again on Thursday in Los Angeles, California, West of the United States, to dismiss the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of "El Pianista," denounced to three judges of the California 2nd District Court of Appeals for serious procedural errors at the time of the events, in 1977.
Hummel said: "I claim that the charges will be dismissed at this very moment, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was chilling."
According to him, Judge Rittenband (died since then) allegedly talked to a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before sentencing, which constitutes a serious procedural offence.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired," from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Wells eventually declared in late September "to have lied to" the author of the documentary.
Hummel called for a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his argument in the event that the court rejects the dismissal of the case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument set out in the first instance, i.e. that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for "illegal sexual relations" with a girl under 13.
Since then, he never stepped on the United States again.
Los Angeles District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski "has to be here to appear at the hearing."
"With this case, do we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is a possibility of fleeing?" Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker "ask for a favor to the court, although he despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to deliver their sentence, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee."
Hummel wasn't the only one asking to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
She argues that her client no longer supports being harassed every time the Polanski case resurfaces, adding: "No one in this room can say the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough.'
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on US arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house prison in his cabin in Gstaad, pending eventual extradition.
Wall Street loses course and slows down by dollar rise
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday aimlessly, in a market that is debated between better than expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.5 points, while the technology component Nasdaq lost 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced 0.37 per cent (4.06 points), hitting 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains narrow, the volume of exchanges is getting smaller and it is going to be maintained until the end of the year.
The trend continued thanks to the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "helped improve market opinion on the soundness of economic revival," summed up analysts at Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales rose 1.3 percent in November for the second straight month and higher than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence visibly recovered in December, 73.4 to 67.4 per cent the previous month, according to the University of Michigan's preliminary index estimate.
However, the indexes were slowed by a new advance on the dollar that reached the highest level in the last two months against the euro, which "leads downwards to sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market fell.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% against 4.492% the day before.
Miss World's election again in South Africa
After a month touring South Africa, the 112 candidates for the Miss World title are in the final straight to fulfill their dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world compared to a billion spectators.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were chosen Miss Athletics or even Miss Top Model during her stay in Africa.
It was a real stir.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
"I saw a lot of things and I lived countless experiences," Miss Sierra Leone said astonished.
This ninth-time contest in South Africa will be broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 5 p.m. (15 h GMT).
Impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
"I'm very happy to have been twice," Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova says in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "African landscapes that take breath away."
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, the candidates for Miss World concentrate on the contest.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both turned Bollywood stars.
Every woman's dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
"We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to go back to my country with the crown," Miss India declares with a big smile.
According to the organizers, the music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, in a swimsuit.
Chinese presenter Angela Chow, the former South African beauty queen, Michelle McLean, and a head of the Miss World committee, Steve Douglas, will lead the event.
South Africa proved to be able to receive the world with warmth and pride difficult to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World pageant.
As last year, the candidates made a safari, visited the famous Soweto township, but this time by bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Something unusual for a head of state, see Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Suudoeste) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I dealt with people I never thought I could meet.
He'll probably be back for the 2010 World Cup, says Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," according to his son David
News of Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," his son David said Friday as he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his father hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
"Dad is strong and everything is going very well," David Hallyday told reporters as he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1pm local (21pm GMT).
The singer's son, relaxed, said he would move "as soon as possible" to the Cedars-Sina hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered on Monday for an infection resulting from the discal hernia operation on November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "induced coma since that night in Los Angeles for comfort reasons, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already undergone a coma induced by doctors at Cedars-Sina' Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for an infection, a sequel to a discal hernia operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was operated again on the night from Wednesday to Thursday because of serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, which his daughter Jade attends, to witness a school event, an AFP photographer confirmed.
The Head of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology of the Pitié-Salpáere Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel Monday to Los Angeles to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused the Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the international private clinic of Monceau Park in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, Camus said.
There is talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too quickly to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
"I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem making the trip, as I was operated on twice as a discal hernia, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he indicated that the singer had apparently "sold without a cannule, without anything," after his Parisian operation.
The Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux worked at the time.
In 2007, she also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a bruise formed by a brain haemorrhage.
He is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by the justice system on several occasions for malpractice, as well as for tax fraud and scam.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" sued "regularly" before the Order's Council, and is "away from being recommended."
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal."
The operation "could not cause haemorrhase and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
Either way, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, entered a parenthesis.
"No doubt, resuming the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, seems very risky to me," Camus said.
The UDF association sets its tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of Francois Bayrou, reacted this Friday to the attempt of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Offer) on the acronym of the former giscardia party, intimidating him to withdraw it from all support, on pain of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, as he considers that Francois Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after having reached out to the left.
On the other hand, the Defence Minister, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of his management, he received the help of Congressman Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current NC) who claims ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it with the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of Francois Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to issue an order to the Minister and the deputy urging them to renounce the acronym and transfer the property rights of the brand, on the basis of a court case.
In recent days, you have made many statements insinuating that you were going to propose to your political movement to recover the UDF acronym, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including Francois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue with the use of the name of the movement, the "Nouveau centre," and the slogan "l'UDF d'aujourd'hui" in their militant material and on the home page of their site, the signatories of the letter say.
As you know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to withdraw "immediately mention of the name of the UDF of all support, as well as (its) website."
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer ownership of (the) brand to the legitimate beneficiaries."
Failure to do so will appeal to justice to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they state that the UDF "has been a real political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "eliged" leaving in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP."
Therefore, the New Center has, according to them, no right to use the UDF acronym.
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to accede to the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office in charge of defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the mark," he was no longer "a member of the UDF for three years," but of the UMP.
It is scandalous and fraudulently used for the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to perform it on its own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make its own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you are not entitled."
Liliane Bettencourt case: Francois-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to put the artist Francois-Marie Banier to trial to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogenarian to plunder her part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of the show's stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose conviction consists of a maximum penalty of three years in prison and 375,000 euros in fine.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga about one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter dispute the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetic empire.
But the No.15 Correctional Court also ordered 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
L'Oréal's heir and main shareholder always refused to undergo such examinations, even more so under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Doctors appointed this Friday will have to submit a report by 10 March 2010 to record whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from states of weakness and for what period.
I think he'll accept.
"I'm going to talk to her," Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said as he left the hearing.
For his part, Francois Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court's decision.
It is excellent news (...) The expert will show that he (Banier) manipulated this elder lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has initiated criminal proceedings against Francois-Marie Banier, a photographer and a multi-faceted artist, accusing him of having taken advantage for years of her mother's weakness to obtain one billion euros in donations, through cheques, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For his part, Liliane Bettencourt always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, whom he considers a long-standing friend.
On Friday, while the court was examining the provenance of the action brought by Ms Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' pleas were sometimes a large family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters her client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said she distrusted Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between once and twice a day for fifteen years.
Since her wedding, I never could talk to Francoise again."
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor &apos; s Office considered, once again, that the applicant was not in a position to appear, all the more so since a guardianship judge refused, in recent days, to give rise to her request to open a judicial guardianship procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to be brought to justice, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No other person will be able to appear in his place," said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that it would rule after the trial on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the big French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees recalls the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is that the collaborators adhere to "values" determined from above as before it was about imposing products thought by factory technicians on consumers.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave its place to the strategies of conquering the markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are not related to the factors of preference of the customers is repeated regularly.
An employee demobilization may end in a deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R &amp; D and, even more, of business intelligence.
Indeed, the BI (Business Intelligence) "requires that all parties involved (...) have proactive conduct and a prospective vision"; it needs a commitment on the part of employees that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian management.
For this reason, we are calling for a managerial revolution, which would consist of putting the collaborators at the centre of the company's concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls have relative utility
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire conducted by Orange among its employees, incite the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I was able to verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many laps, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did. B989
- Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great engineering schools, they interpret psychology in a mechanistic way.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the ancient behavioral theory that American "neurosciences" recently revived, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media spread widely behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of the executives' commitment, a recent Ipsos investigation published on Le Figaro.fr reaffirms managers in a mechanistic management position, unfit to the world today.
Identifying and measuring mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises implies adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating into every reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to realize part of its dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from the Motifunctional Analysis adopt this conception of employees' motivations.
Studies showed that they judge their company based on a default doxa that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of mobilization factors, company managers can control, foresee and anticipate their "social performance" and relocate human resources management "in the place."
In this way, they create a favorable terrain for the organized development of strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: For 'fair war' Obama gets praise from right
On Friday, the American right, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of "fair war" against America's enemies, hailed Obama's speech on Thursday.
Conservatives, who had discredited the Obama award on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 election.
"I loved what he said," Ms. Palin, a senior figure on the right wing of the Republican party, told USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the issue of war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memoir.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
Terrorists must be stopped, he said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself, on Thursday in Oslo, to justifying the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
"I think the speech was really good," rejoiced the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
"At times, the speech seemed very historic to me," Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway."
The former elected representative, who some consider to be a possible candidate for the Republican inauguration for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear "a left-wing president" when he reminded members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not give a peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W's speeches. Bush and current chronicler in the Washington Post, Obama delivered "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world," as he "always does," he "talked as an American president" by reminding Europeans "who live in a security bubble that they didn't create and that don't do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the not-greated right-wings, a Bush-era hawk, former ambassador to the UN John Bolton called the speech "monotonous, pretentious and lacking inspiration" on the National Review Online website.
On the left of the president, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
"When we cover war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents," he warned.
The center-left press, however, praised the president.
Los Angeles, while still believing Obama received the Nobel prematurely, called his speech "superproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," the Californian newspaper said enthusiastically.
Obama "pronounced the speech that was necessary," the New York Times said, judging it "at once grim and edifying."
Carriage transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure Christmas supply
After three marathon negotiating sessions, the unions in the road sector and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employers' organization that remained until the end, arrived on Friday afternoon at an agreement that ends the strike slogan and the threat to Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, the secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau, "welcomed" to the agreement, after several negotiating sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, negotiators said goodbye to Friday's dawn in hopes of quickly signing the text of agreement late in the morning.
Even though three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew slamming.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "it was feared to disturb the end-of-year holidays," Bussereau said.
The text provides for a 4 per cent increase for lower wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9 per cent for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low wages.
"It's not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage," Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
If so, we will give the order to our militants that there be no more cuts or blockades in the supply centers.
But there can always be some dissenting rebellious, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this is "a good agreement," although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition."
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense that respects wage earners, Maxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement."
For Richard Jaubert (CGT), it is "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs of 3% and the holding of general assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will make it possible to address the issue of extraordinary pay and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a drop of 100 million euros in the employer's burdens" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 rectification finance bill, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms."
The TLF signing allows the agreement to apply, first of all, to companies attached to this organisation and, secondly, to the entire profession, in the event that the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done "as soon as possible," Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers' organisations could only delay the process.
The FNTR reported that it was a "naive business," as the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the CO2 tax."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to contradict those who want to eat turkey at the next Christmas Eve dinner, the Unostra lamented.
For the OTRE, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months."
RER A: Conflicts over the weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
Conflicts at RER A, France's largest urban public transport line, are set to continue over the weekend, because at Friday's meeting, the second day of strike between unions and RATP management, there was no agreement and unions were dissatisfied with their premium request.
For this important holiday shopping weekend, on Saturday and Sunday only trains will run between 10am and 8 p.m., at the rate of one train of every two on the central stretch (between La Défense and Nation) and one train of every four on the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Préfecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which expect 200,000 customers every day, were glad that "the RATP strives to provide service to the big stores."
RER A crosses the Parisian city from West to East.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, approximately one in two trains circulated at rush hours, and almost no train in valley hours, as planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder on the platforms thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Isle of France.
In this way, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than normal, especially due to the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had got up "an hour and a half earlier to get to schedule."
Saint-Lazare station was not sars, SNCF said, which had provided for the supervision of police and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from the Saint-Lazare station to join the meters.
New general assemblies of striking workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, will be analyzed from a meeting with the management on Friday afternoon.
The director of the RERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That's not what drivers want claiming a premium they're owed, according to Thierry Garon (Sud).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT said outraged, noting that management "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved."
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a more extensive analysis of the conditions of exercise of the profession," the RATP said.
Which also led the unions to say the company "didn't care about weekend users."
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the management, which until then refused to talk during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters."
The conflict could spill over to RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Independants submitted a notice.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line that has a million passengers per day.
RER drivers, all in the second grade of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for hours with alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurdish party, a decision with serious consequences
Turkey's Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately provoked demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The party of the Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that harmed the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," the president of the Court, Hasim Kili, told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a seven-vote majority was needed to obtain dissolution, Kilia said, adding that 37 of the party leaders, including its president Ahmet T.rk and deputy Aysel Tugluk, are separated from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by T.rk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's property by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
Its leaders warned ahead of the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament before being MPs without a partisan label.
The decision follows a procedure launched by the prosecutor of the Supreme Court, Abdurrahman Yalinkaya, in 2007, which accuses the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many more countries.
Many observers believe the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party claims that it has no "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to describe it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court's verdict comes as the government extends a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders said that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in Southeast Anatomical, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK chief Abdullah Ecalan degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great city of the Southeast populated mostly by Kurds.
The Order Forces threw tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov bombs or slingshot stones.
In Istanbul, approximately 100 people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, T.rk stated that the decision of the justice system was going to "deefuse discouragement."
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (kurda, NDLR) by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, made up of a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle we are opposed to the closure of parties.
Nothing is resolved, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic opening launched by the government, political analyst Ahmet Insel said.
"We can, of course, expect a reaction from the PKK," he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack in which seven soldiers died three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Snowfall can start suddenly
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is not something that wants to make life impossible for citizens, says the director of road maintenance in winter of the FES
But with that its employees can learn to test and master the entire vehicle technology.
Meteorologists may announce it for the first time over the weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to deal with snow and ice.
In this case, the EES acts in accordance with a thorough plan.
As soon as it snowsprofusely in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A-sides with large salt vehicles come out, Brauburger explains.
For example, main arteries and avenues such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstrasse are included.
But also the accesses for the fire department, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sections with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstrasse.
The FES service starts around 3 a.m.
Approximately 1,040 kilometres should be covered, as required, within a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That's why the FES starts around three o'clock in the morning, "with this the tracks are free until the traffic of the rush hours begins."
The hard part is when it starts to snow around 7:30.
"Then we have a problem," says the director of road maintenance in winter, "because then no one is ready to clear space for salt vehicles."
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it is up to the secondary and private roads, to which the Rat-Beil-Stra'e also belongs.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That's where the inconvenience is generated, Brauburger knows well.
At around five o'clock in the morning, the infantry of the FES is set in motion, mainly the dangerous points and cruises are cleared.
Usually the FES could not take over all bike lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 a.m. does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, Brauburger says.
As these quickly slippery, the salt-emitting vehicle gets underway as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of an emergency, the police can also call them.
The cradle of the dinosaur
The Tawa found looked the same as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal two meters long and 1.50 meters high that ran on the two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp and curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of years later, this wouldn't have been something special.
But the Tawa found was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday's journal Science.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at the time was in a dry area of the supercontinent Pangea on the equator.
Tawa opened a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, the propagation and characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation in 2006 at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
"Sometimes, we've found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, this is unprecedented for Triassic sediments," says Randall Irmis, a team member of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation they collected the remains of five specimens.
A finding confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it's an exceptional finding: "The dinosaur fossils of the Triassic are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not fully share such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn says for example.
According to the current current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the older fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts discuss, for example, when saurians were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: carnivorous theropods among those of Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptor and also birds, quadruped sauropods known as "long neck" and their relatives, and the Ornithischia herbivores (sail with bird pelvis), to which, for example, the species Triceratops and Ste- Igosaurus.
According to analysis by Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa finds is a primitive theropod.
This one shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, Nesbitt says.
For example, in Tawa's skull, researchers found signs of air bags, such as those also possessed by the descendants of theropods, birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In Tawa's case, the bones of the spine were evidently filled with air in part.
Tawa is the theropod with older, primitive air bags, Randall Irmis says.
Because the related line of the subsequent giant sauropods also had air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common predecessors of both groups would already produce this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far known lived in South America, the researchers deduce that the saurians first emerged there.
Therefore, the three genealogical lineages were initially separated and spread from South America to every corner of the Earth, which at the time still formed a unique Earth mass, the Pangea supercontinent.
However, the facts say the team found along with Tawa to find the remains of two other not closely-minded theropods.
All three cannot descend from a uniquely related predecessor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are opponents, too.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of the dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils continue to be preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare collateral line from reptiles to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and pterosaurs and many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs spread all over the world and many new species developed, while kinship became extinct at the Triassic boundary to the Jurassic.
Successful stories weren't eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
It may have been given a massive extinction that dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to beat the opponents in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact is the boom of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triassic and since then carried a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the international signatories.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California, participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction from the occupied casino at Frankfurt's Goethe University hit the world.
278 professors and professors at Goethe University, although also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with students in protest at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Moller-Estler, president of the university, evicted last week the building occupied by students and teachers on educational strike, because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police commando."
The eviction represented an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served "the delegitimization and criminalization of protest" and diverted attention from the content.
The board has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the judicial complaint.
Most occupants have caused no material damage, it is said.
legitimized protest
Young people from the Verdi union and the German Federation of Trade Unions also stand in solidarity with students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for the future itself, says Verdi's national youth secretary, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kahne-Hermann (CDU), Minister of Sciences of Hessen, however, defended the performance of the rector of the university and the police.
We are grateful to the university rector.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he said in a broadcast on Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the Wiesbaden province parliament.
"We are understanding of the protest, but we are not sympathetic to the vandalism," said Peter Beuth, a provincial parliament delegate for the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (left) said.
Instead of thoroughly studying the arguments and demands of the students, they are evicted.
The Left has tabled a motion, requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenogre, one of Moscow's ten districts, was a heavily guarded site in the Soviet Union for secret weapons investigation.
Today, the 216,000-strong community, located 37 kilometres from central Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley."
Here are important research and micro and nanoelectronics research and production centres.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenogre have contacted Riedberg's headquarters in Frankfurt, the university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were given and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign a "procurement of close collaboration" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Selen Mayor Anatoly Smirnov led the Russian delegation; Frankfurt signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ representatives and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises from the natural science research centre will travel to a seminar in Selenode.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses business relationships.
The FIZ company will have the possibility to set foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is home to major Russian research companies and institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscovita Institute of Electronic Technology, the large Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika consortia.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for weapons research.
Selenogre (literally translated as "Green City") was named after the landscape of wooded mountains, where research facilities were set up.
Stuttgart brakes
The Stuttgart 21 Dimension is not high enough at all.
For supporters of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe."
The law is. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, rather than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate to the capital of the Banden-Werttemberga region a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which end up in the middle of the city, were then considered 19th-century engineering fossils, which acted as brakes on modern rail traffic, as it used to take a huge amount of time to hook the locomotives from behind to the front.
Roll around, stop dry to continue the journey; but that's how it must be done.
And that's why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passage station, which is about halfway through the journey of the trans-European operating lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan of "Heart of Europe."
The S21 will really be initiated, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer more compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost unpayable to implement the reduction.
Rail terminals of course do not have any more input and exit problems, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver's cart at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE-built stretch to Ulm will be launched.
Federal and communal politicians have arranged it that way.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the Republic's major individual infrastructure projects are borne by the taxpayer and not the State.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to a certain extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably of the designer's computer-generated graphics.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first work to strengthen freight transport, as rail transport is considerably greener than that made by trucks on the roads.
However, the new sections under construction are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other rail projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe it is more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing from other crosses and narrow passages on the net.
A total of sixty larger projects are on the Ministry of Transport's list.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometers of long rails across the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the slow-step layout has been built.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The section of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for the international transport of goods: through the heart of Europe.
The government is considering the sentence on the airport.
The federal government leaves pending in the Autonomous Parliament of Wiesbaden, if it is to file an appeal against the ruling on the night flight ban of the Hesse administrative court.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have commissioned experts to investigate the VGH ruling of more than 400 pages, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
The administrative court in Kassel had substantiated in writing on this date that in the case of the construction of the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt airport, the Land would again have to regulate the ban on night flights.
Admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as provided for by the federal government, would not be reconciled with the mandatory legal protection of the noise population due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until 4 January, whether it will file an appeal against this sentence.
The opposition criticized the postponement and pressed government representatives to resign from the appeal to the nation's Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schsfer-Gmbel, called on the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections. Otherwise this could be taken as a lack of speech.
"It's pretty difficult, if you let you keep your word," Greens boss Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the FDP slogan "We keep our word."
Minister Posch rejected the recrimination of Schsfer-Gmbel, which the federal government would be trying through misrepresentations of the law and tricks, yet to obtain its night flights.
Extensive legal inquiry would take quite a while.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "first quick impression."
"We need a legally blameless decision," said Stefan Moller (FDP).
As the opposition represents, it would never have been his group's claims about the night air traffic ban.
U.S. banks return the aid borrowed.
The big US banks shaken by the crisis are stripped of their state ties.
The "Bank of America" returned the aid provided by the Tarp bank bailout fund of a total of 45 billion (approximately 30 billion euros) to it.
And the Citi group also plans to return state aid, according to a report by U.S. CNBC.
With this, the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation on the payment of the bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The "Bank of America" had raised about 19 billion liquid money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had plenty of means, among others, for the sale of items.
Banking director Kenneth Lewis thanked American taxpayers on Wednesday night, especially: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The bank house had miscalculated the investment bank's takeover effort at the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also intends to raise money in the capital market in order to free itself from its obligations to the state.
CNBC reported from a source of known circles, that the US bank could announce as early as Thursday the increase in its capital by $20 billion.
A representative for the Citi group declined to comment.
In June they had already returned their assists Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick election
In the end it was all faster than thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF (German television channel) administrative board pressed editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can present a successor.
Yesterday night the guild intended to vote on the candidate.
The favourite was Peter Frey, director of the main studio at the ZDF in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this from the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But surely it also influenced the failure to damage ZDF director Markus Schochter anymore, if this proposal would not be approved either in the administrative council.
Frey, Schchter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The result of the vote was not yet finalised at the close of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schochter failed in the administrative council with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender's contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Schchter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the Union majority on the administrative council as early as the election had indicated they would not support Brender in his post.
Opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by Hesse's government president, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another term of the prestigious editor-in-chief with the argument, which under Brender's guidance, ZDF news outlets would have lost audience rates.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which political influence over the ZDF was flogged.
In the end, 35 public law specialists had even meddled in the debate, who described Koch's action as unconstitutional.
But it didn't help.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanesque philology.
He then worked on the "S.Dwestfunk" and in the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau."
In 1983 it was changed for the ZDF, in principle to the "heute-journal" information.
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal drafteman of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and driver of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of the ZDF foreign policy director; since then director of the ZDF studio in the capital.
The Greens' political party announced a constitutional lawsuit following Brender's dismissal, which was still elected Wednesday as a journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazin."
Koch's opponent on the administrative board, the president of the Rhineland-Palatinate government, explained last week that the federal states should change the state agreement of the ZDF in such a way that the director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A retreat of pro-government politicians from the ZDF control guilds was ruled out by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, recommended to the administrative board with a smart move: he strongly criticised the guild for Brender's dismissal.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence, both Schochter was able to appoint him to the position of editor-in-chief without losing his face, and the administrative council was able to vote on him, without falling under the suspicion of giving the post to a henchman.
Frey's party calculations are awarded to the left-wing Liberals anyway.
University careers clear
Partial success for students: after one year of strikes related to education, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the Lands finally gave in. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of bachelor's and master's degrees.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of exams: basically each module of the race must end with a single exam.
In addition, it is intended to examine the workload of students, and the aim is to ensure a "real and justifiable measure."
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam results among universities inside and outside Germany.
The Lands are committed to more flexiblely crafting the structural rules as a whole for Bachelor and Master careers.
Regulations of the Land states that diverge from this, must no longer exist.
Less exams
Since the start of student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the rectors of universities have continually talked about improving the realization and successful conclusion of a career (studyability).
For the first time, there was talk of specific content.
The so-called accreditation board agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module ends with a single exam," says a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
The "significant reduction in the burden of examination" is intended to avoid development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect studyability, as explained by the director of the accreditation board, Mr. - Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future "studiability" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and contents should be thoroughly examined in terms of unnecessary restrictions on students' choice.
the courses.
Students would have "the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and promote their own initiative."
These rules would be valid for new races, but also in the examination of existing racing.
These should be "recredited" again every five years. But this would mean, it would take until 2015 to review all races.
Those responsible for this would be 10 accreditation agencies across the country, which are under the supervision of the accreditation board, which is installed by the Lands.
Ministers of education and culture urged the Lands in October to influence agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with the ministries to take such measures.
Until now only Rhine-Platinate has claimed to provide additional means for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement tutoring and student counseling programs, as well as strengthen exam offices and abroad.
The Land and the universities intend to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
In early 2010, the government wants to bring a novel of university law to parliament.
According to her, a single test should be enough for the completion of a career model.
The configuration of the career should be made more flexible, in addition to ensuring the recognition of evaluations in other universities and facilitating accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of next year it is intended to examine all racing about their "studyability."
On Thursday, the government and opposition again discussed the conditions of study in the federal state.
Apart from the praise, there was also criticism about the decisions.
The board of directors at the federal level of the Juso (young socialist) university groups was responsible, that the configuration of education policy should no longer be carried out "after closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
By the time after the education strikes, students as the main involved should now be able to give their opinion as well.
The president of the board of university rectors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: "We need the experience of the students," she said Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with which HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW), the Bonn agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union requires a legal right for every student with the Bachelor title to access a later Masters career.
In addition, the Land states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in the future sufficient master's degree places for Master with the best possible study conditions. This was reported by a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federated states have to tag a lot more teachers.
But about greater access to the master's degree, education ministers did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Moller
"Entering and leaving Germany is done practically without control," says the first line of a poem by the lyric Werner S.llner in unbalanced language fragments, in which he themed experiences of arriving in Germany lived by a dissident, who gained his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner S.llner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader in a children's book publishing house, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
In 1993 he gave the memorable lessons or poetry talks in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum at Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He said he spoke a lot last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and disfigured mirror of their Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, S.llner read a statement in which he admitted the participation as IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow German-Roma writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
In conjunction with some of those present in 1989, S.llner had received the German Language Prize.
Recruitment attempts had begun slowly, in early 1971.
"Therefore I am someone who did not defend himself enough in the face of the Securitate's attempts to provoke fear," concluded S.llner.
The lyric Werner S.llner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Moller and his literary polemic unparalleled with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene is shaken and especially the community of German authors from Romania for a case that shows the abysses and evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner S.llner is, as far as is known, he is not only the author, but also a victim.
In his Securitate IM file Walter had played a role, said literary scientist Michael Markel after the confession of S.llner, and stressed the positive influence for him of the Walters.
"He had excused or defended him on every difficult point for him," Markel said.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
The statement of Sollner in this form and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of an ex-dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for spies of the Securitate-Spitzel gewesen, wrote Herta Moller already in July in the weekly "Zit," after having read his own 914-page file.
Those involved will surely have speculated and known in some cases, what names were hidden behind the pseudons of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the review of Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the deal with the control files by the Securitate is still quite diffuse.
Systematic clarification has been boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the files of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then has been given rather by dragging on.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of files.
An interview, after the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Moller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large. In this interview a former head of the Securitate de Temesvar spoke contemptuously of the decorated.
"She has psychosis," she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to show itself without turns in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the S.llner case, as so many times when there are silent guilt.
Why right now? Who was hurt? The calm reaction of the listeners to the confession of S.llner leaves to hope that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the desire for knowledge and not so much by the award of guilt and out of shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Moller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in literature, is more than just a footnote.
Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When Stuttgart's new VfB soccer team coach, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team's supplier, boarded a Class C-C-C taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, gave the impression that an elegantly dressed outside service member was coming out of a very nice Christmas celebration, in which the sports goods maker had handed out samples.
The man in the bald property had hired a driver because he still didn't know the city.
Otherwise, he could also have driven the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and the 55-year-old man was not drunk with joy either.
It had been a nice evening, but tomorrow the job would start again.
Or it would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we reached the eighth of the final," namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 triumph against Unirea Urziceni, from Romania, but we cannot be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against the descent."
The "much more important task" awaited them the next Sunday, he said.
Then it will be necessary to repeat in Mainz the success of the royal classes" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have clearly been evident again, after the fast three goals of Marica (5), Tr.sch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Draw
The Champions League's eighth finals (one-way matches on 16/17 and 23/24 February/trounteen sides 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on December 18 in Nyon.
So the joy was limited by the fulminating entrance of Babbel's successor.
Not only in the supposed saviour, which in a short time had inspired the bewildered Stuttgart's bewilderment of self-confidence, he was willing to give up and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them they had to concentrate on their strengths, I tried to be more thrown, explained the soul repairer Gross his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with the therapist Babbel had no longer had an effect.
He deployed a certain magic, accepted Babbel's supporter, Jens Lehmann, when a new impulse emerges in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a pause of several weeks due to an injury immediately advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the phenomenon" perceived with the proverbial fresh wind" and the way of working the new boss: He is a man who intervenes in depth, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this is what I had obviously missed when Babbel was.
VfB Stuttgart has not passed the test yet, warns sports manager Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all constancy.
Like Gross, the players and the manager also refrained from overstating the triumph against a defense weakened by lack of relay and totally overtaken from Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 the sad awakening had arrived, Khedira thought.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while a goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still a long way off.
We haven't gotten over the problem yet.
That Heldt didn't feel like celebrating on his 40th birthday, even after the first win at his side for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were updated again in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been awarded by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions others make, and not Jens, faced Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had reproached weakness in the management of the board of directors, which had decided to change coaching because of the pressure of teenage fans.
Also that his day off after games had been eliminated, Lehmann described it as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt replied, and announced consequences for the laggard.
They're probably no longer friends forever, the two four.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without previous efforts with the replacement coaching team, the spectacle of great game and battle strength would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had an important participation in success," Heldt and Lehmann said in unison; and the man in the plastic suitcase also agreed.
Fight of the heavyweight world championship
A fiery duel in Bern: Time and again challenger Kevin Johnsonn was provoking world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after 12 tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judges' trial was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC trade version won American Kevin Johnson on Friday night in Bern on Friday night in the Bern by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knock-out that everyone had hoped for couldn't be done.
Klitschko extended his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to give up due to his injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his 24th fight.
Before about 17,000 spectators at the Arena de Berna, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight especially with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimetres lower, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was dodging the world champion's blows over and over again, so Klitschko could not decisively take his dangerous right-handed target.
Overall, the Johnson passive did too little for a challenger, and he only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his punches only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve rounds complete with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a "horrible zombie," who can't do anything."
When he made the weigh, the champion allowed himself to provoke himself on Friday to remove Johnson from the sunglasses of his nose so he could see his eyes."
Fourth triumph after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a nearly four-year break, he beat Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time, and had regained "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to deliver without a fight.
That year he beat Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba in his title defenses and Chris Arreola of the United States in September.
In this fight I only got hit, and I'm in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to bring together all four major titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he dethroned Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall in November.
In the summer before, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for Sept.
The company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London is reportedly planning.
The Kunduz case
Front-opposition attack: The head of the Greens group, J.rgen Trittin, called Defense Minister Gutenberg a liar because of false information on the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the leftists demand an explanation from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - After the latest revelations about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has reproached the Minister of Defense, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), for misleading himself with knowledge of the cause.
On Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast, broadcast on the television channel ARD, the head of the Greens group, J.rgen Trittin, said that the minister had not knowingly told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it's usually said: he told lies.
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and that Mr. "Gutenberg," Trittin said.
On Friday, it had been reported that this attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also of intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the United States airstrike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the report of the NATO investigation, killed or injured up to 142 people.
The Greens, the SPD and the left on Saturday urged federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak out immediately before the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs. Merkel has to clarify whether an intentional assassination strategy is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy, and whether the chancellor's office, the army and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, they demanded J.rgen Trittin and her colleague from the Greens Renate K.nast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The foreign ministry exerted no influence on concrete actions by the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also been raised about the Ministry's presentation on the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL information, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially, they had been told that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had hidden sensitive details from the minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials it transplaces meant that they had even pointed to the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a report from a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert reportedly asked in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung."
So far he has received no response, it was said.
The ministry did not speak on Saturday regarding the reproaches made to it, and pointed out that this would be clarified in the committee of inquiry of the Federal Parliament, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Honey worlds
In a waking state, some people see images and hear voices that others don't see or hear.
Not only in the case of the mentally ill and drug addicts, the boundaries between imagination and reality fade.
As long as it happens during the sleep, everything is in order.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can give ourselves unfettered to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, anyone who experiences sleep-like states during the vigil, or sees and hears things that others don't see or hear, is considered most of the time in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addicted, or at least as a maniac.
But such images and voices don't just arise in the mentally ill or drugged.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint painting or write novels, sometimes cause the boundaries between sleep, madness and reality to be blurred.
Side-advised alert states can appear in the most diverse ways, at best we call them visions, and at worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, the visions of the mystique Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castañeda, the states of Shamanic possession, and psychosis and hallucinations can be referred to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neuronal substances of communication in the brain has been derailed - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - and interaction between various parts of the same is disturbed.
During a schizophrenic psychosis very often complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts appear.
Gravity no longer has power over him.
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of sleep in a state of vigil, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness with the dream states," for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the nonsense, crazy formations, and mirages of it."
It's the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book figure.
Its body is two-dimensional and scandalously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over him, he's floating near the roof of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, demon figures with wings, with red grins like blood, deformed, gnashing teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him in heavy, flaming boots, throwing him at the walls, he feels the pains all over his body.
Strident and evil voices resonate from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that insult him and offend him.
Henning T. rips two stereo cables, tie them to form a hanging knot, and fixes them on a hook on the ceiling.
He gets up in a horn and knots around his neck.
Jump.
The rope is loose.
What a lesson you, they scream the voices in a choir that bursts the eardrums, go to the clinic and make them heal you."
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause that caused it was LSD.
Your diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, and it is maniac-depressive, taking medication, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
About one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the interior, and fall into a state of overexcitement that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, relationship disorders, or persecutory mania.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish how important it is from what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician at the psychiatry clinic general at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the centre of events, everything has a meaning directed at it.
At the same time he enters a passive role, as in a dream, he feels overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
That's why schizophrenic people often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, to wake up, impossible.
Having experienced a once-in-a-lifetime hallucination
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality perceived in psychosis remains in principle as it is."
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the distance from experience takes place in reality.
For researchers, it's still unknown why our brain makes goats.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can lead anyone to lose contact with reality on a temporary basis.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic arrangement for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determining factors.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neural maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains unknown how this alteration of the neural system occurs, which also does not manifest at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role - stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when there is already a prior disposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain's transmitting system.
When the brain warms up
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive medications to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lebeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf (The Unreal World in Our Head), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, along with psychic disorders such as personality boundary disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and cranioencephalic trauma .
surprisingly and in certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers from hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of memories that are normally repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain where sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or unprevented; when our brain warms, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, evil of love or other exceptional brain states.
In j?ngeren Studien gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, mindestens einmal im Leben eine Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. He was 16 years old, lived in a small town of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and went to a high school.
A regular girl.
If it wasn't for those images and the voices.
Sometimes, during recess, it happens that a clumsy boy with long dark hair addresses the word.
When she answers him, the other students look at her underwhelming; no one, apart from her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a bit of a strange dreamer, but Sarah K. He knows he's not dreaming.
She's awake and go and hear that kid, just as she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You may even feel your presence, at least a few moments.
He's a nice feeling, he likes the kid.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When you are in class you can sometimes not follow the lesson because the teacher stuck to his eyes and ears is presenting a new partner, while for the rest he explains mathematical equations in a visible and audible way.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
As he waits in the dark room for the sleep to arrive, which often arrives late and scarce, he does not know how to distinguish whether he is awake or dreaming, if the images he sees, the shows or the girl with bleeding cuts in his arms and legs, appear in front of his eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, yell at the figures.
Her parents and friends haven't told anything, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. He's 20 years old today.
She passed last year and lives with her boyfriend.
Half a year ago, hallucinations have disappeared.
Since she came into contact online with psychologist Kasten, she knows she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art for desperation.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a stimuli restriction, it is very likely that after a while he will start having hallucinations.
I think the brain is unoccupied and it takes care of looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., an only daughter, was scared of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at 13, he learned that the man he calls Dad since he has used the reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noise, those affected by Sarah K. They find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. Every experience," Kasten says, "It takes place in the brain, the reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are just as images that the brain produces, so they seem so real."
Kasten also classifies nighttime fantasies as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenic, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
Limit situation between sleep and hallucination
In this world too consciously focused, imaginary experiences usually pathologize, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses Hospital in Dusseldorf.
Psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
Thirheal hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that can no longer differentiate from being awake.
Thirhement conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiaculopathy, who experience motor paralysis while fully conscious. die bei vollem Bewusstsein eine motorische L.hmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of oneself or the world due to a total and permanent motor incapacity, it replaces a very dangerous real situation with a world of its own and imaginary that is decoupled from reality.
A form of borderline situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change of world, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an unbearable situation itself that our own capacity for creation allows us not to sink into the nowhere to loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen, of Zurich, also describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as a soul-rescuing action.
He was 49 when his conscience embarked on several-day trips after a heart transplant operation with a heart transplant included, while his body was doomed to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen immersed himself in a world created by it and visited strange places of other times: he was lying in bed, an older man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot watched for his health.
It was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorbike kidnapped him in his home country, surfed on his hospital bed in the Alps with firn snow and met a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, thus describing his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds the Schmidt-Degenhard psychiatrist.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of external reality is, even when we are awake.
Every change in the state of consciousness, psychologist Kasten sums up, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.

Burda
The children will take over the publisher at 27 years of age
New editor Kallen has come up with a tentative solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also become in the hands of the family.
Hamburg - Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two sons become heirs at 27 and are determined to enter the company, Burda, 69, told SPIEGEL.
Details have been arranged as a precaution.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if you are trained to do so.
You can't put 7,500 workers in front of your children, if you're not enough to do so.
That would end the children and also the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will retire from January chair of the board and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, 52, has been a member of the management of Burda since 1999.
At first he was responsible for technology.
Later, he took care of the treasury and thus came the responsibility for the company's assets. After the departure of J.rgen Todenhafer, he also took over direct marketing, foreign exchange, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is on the top of the publisher.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old. His son Felix, who was now 42, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment also serves to "save the differences of 10, 15 years," according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also become in the hands of the family.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said family businesses are also not safe from the decline: "This has always affected families who let themselves be infected by the desire to search for capital, who have misjudged and thought they could rise as well as the greatest player.
That's never been my strategy.
"I've never had "delusions of greatness," Burda says.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play with the "Time" in the world league either; those businesses have become too big.
Comprehensive beauty
Everything you - in terms of beauty and well-being - can be desired, within reach of your hand.
This is what seems to have been proposed El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and pampering of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai - which is responsible for laser hairlosing-; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the tearie stands out, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while contemplating the unbeatable views of the capital, or renting the relaxation area for two hours to ride your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a Jacuzzi session, massages and having a cup of champagne are some of the possibilities offered by Spaxy.
A total of 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and newest facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to combat cellulite or vibratory platforms.
The gym also has these machines, as well as virtual 'trainers' who are guiding the steps of customers, offering them a totally personalized treatment.
Everything starts by entering your personal key on a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
So, several videos show us how to perform our exercise table correctly.
Its director says that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdresser's shop, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where rituals of hair recovery, brightness or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 in the morning to 22:00 in the evening.
Varied neckline
Christmas is approaching and it is never too much to review the stars' looks to adapt them to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
There's a few suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It's not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the Barcelona City Council, has created the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will reach agreements on mobility, managing, coordinating, submitting grants, etc.
On the other hand it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, it is intended to promote what will be the transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
They are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
This is intended to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include energy-related activities and in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has assets a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the motor sector
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, glimpses "a horizon of tranquillity" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector in the country.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has put in place throughout the exercise to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a landscape of abandonment, of closing some of our main production plants," said the president of the government.
"Thanks to this plan and at the disposal of the brands to be followed in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquillity for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed both for the development of new models and to modernize existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government demand support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with the Autonomous Communities and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan has reduced by 6% the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Show will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and fans of the engine world.
This initiative will be developed from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only will you be able to find classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find items of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, you can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of classic motorshouting that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will include, among others, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, sale of cars; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and restoration of cars; or Cochera Classic, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Tests of skill on the outside
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be completed with parallel activities: holding rallies, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests will also be carried out with classic cars and motorcycles on a circuit on the outside of the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sportsmanship
Mazda wants to show that sportsmanship is not at odds with respect for the environment.
For this reason, it has just incorporated into the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system - called the i-Stop - a device that at least for the moment is only available with the 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 stands out for the good note achieved throughout it.
Finishes, completion of the vehicle, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting at the driving post, we see that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and grip.
Also, the touch of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Continuing with the set formed by the instrument box and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with a large number of buttons and flashy controls and colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this Japanese compact has more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Added to all this is a large trunk with regular shapes.
The engine's stop and automatic start system, at least for the time being, is only available with the two-litre and 150-horse-horse gasoline engine and with the manual change of six gears.
This engine is a real delight. It stands out for its finesse, for its reduced rumors, for the performance and for achieving content consumption.
Although the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometers a year should not rule out this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high running comfort, and for its content consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, that is the one that incorporates a greater number of serial elements.
The standard equipment stands out especially the lane-changing wizard (RVM) that removes the dead angle, the traction and stability controls, the speed control, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, independent air conditioner, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and audio bluetooth and 17-inch alloy wheels.
In addition, in addition, its equipment was not enough, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptive headlights and BOSE sound system with disc charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It stands out especially for the quality of the materials used, their behavior and the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make many kilometers a year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the 150-horse horsepower 2.0 gasoline engine.
The only inconvenience of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and the 23,270 euros of the proven version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us every day great doses of satisfaction.
'Premiere' luxury
- L. A. covers the red carpet of sensuality by the hand of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever wrapped in models as stylish as 'sexy' at the 'Nine' premiere. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without even seeing certain types of attachments or browse the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the US when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing him on the street is harder, the truth is, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
Given the success the company has released two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's as limited as its American counterpart, but comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price of about 12 euros per month includes roaming across Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is to have to give up the data when crossing the border or desperately looking for a cafeteria with WiFi (or a Fon connection) so they can check the mail.
The idea of a fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and long ago it would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small print.
The European Commission's repeated ear pulls to achieve affordable roaming charges across Europe have barely had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That an appliance like FonPeek (it is still curious that it bears the name Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets this type of fare means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other internet queries.
No contracts and no bagpipes.
It is a connected device and is paid for it when buying it, not month by month.
And that's what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, a buy option with lifelong access like Peek already has in the U.S.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I look at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it's a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's fetish color
Yellow is undoubtedly the American first lady's preferred tone.
If he already went to Barack Obama's inauguration as president of the United States in a dress and a coat of this color, he has chosen the same to accompany him in undoubtedly the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has carried a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color - greenish yellow with bright reflections - both times the outfit was composed of three pieces - dressing, jacket and coat of the same fabric - and adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the wake of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat vestaurio.
But the fabric in which the two costumes are made makes them very different.
If for the takeover of it I was dealing with a fat lace, in Oslo it is a velvet with print.
The accessories have also varied: green shoes of half heel the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: a pickup on this occasion, mane loosens the previous one.
Seventy-five per cent of working mothers have had problems with their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fashion and career of women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt: 75 per cent of working mothers have been limited in opportunities in the workplace due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences in the beginning of cohabitation as a couple and the number of children, depending on whether or not they work and the type of work they carry out.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have an unstable job, start cohabitation as a couple before, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women in stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay coexistence and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years of age with fixed work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting cohabitation, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time than their life trajectory to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a lot of influence on motherhood although less on the schedule of pairing," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that differentiates the age of women when they marry and having the first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the higher the age at which they marry and the first child.
The difference is also maintained between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with elementary and higher education have been mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 on average respectively.
"Another division is also established between women according to their level of education.
While those who have elementary education marry and have their first child before getting a stable job, those with middle or higher levels invest this sequence and give priority to obtaining stable work as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child," Delgado details.
Diane Kruger is worth it too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will become an image of different brand products, singing the universal motto of 'Because I'm worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noel', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other famous signings of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millionaire').
In the male section, the cosmetic brand also features luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Anatomy of Grey') and Matthew Fox (Evanngeline's companion in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - gathered at the annual awards ceremony, which was held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chosen Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicent's poker
Manuel Vicent gives in 'Póquer de aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty X-rays of writers who have gone through their literary life (and, in cases, also the other).
It does not do so in the predictable and fearsome genres (biographical semblance, life and work), but looking for something similar to the ignition nucleus of the creative character.
The trip has its excitements and Vicent does not save scares or illuminations.
In addition to exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to read and rereading.
I leave you some snapshots here.
About Albert Camus: "In its pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the same one that I felt without giving it its name: pleasure against the bitter fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in his blood, not in the intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling, meaningless poetic humor, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
Above Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh she embraced the excitement of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the peaks of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be scaled by the north wall, from which the best mountaineers are thrown away over and over again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said he was heir to a county landowner and others he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the insane cry thrown from a bridge by that Munich character to take his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century in his literary form and did so on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day he got down on his knees and prayed: 'Dear God, I beg you to stop writing as a woman.'
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were recorded these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after life fed up pleased death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "In the baggage he also brought his depressions.
The husband accepted it normally that she told him that Edward VII spied on her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
There has never been the case of such a patient man and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness.
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but to go to Baroja for Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do but abduct the fame of that man to serve as his own pedestal?"
Cowardly assault
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed by her and our dog, a mestizo specimen, rescued from the kennel and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, were given two kicks that left the dog badly injured.
Our indignation is capital because we did not find the fun in a free aggression against a small and helpless animal, which by the way was tied.
To this must be added the suffocation caused to a lady who was walking quietly and who, when she rebuked these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energetic man who attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred at five o'clock on a Tuesday afternoon in a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we filed a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt will serve very much and not to generate susceptibilities, just clarify that the coward killers were Spanish.
Outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what's happening among young people to consider it fun to mistreat a helpless animal free of charge that gives us affection, company and friendship.
We don't know where good education and respect for animals and people have stayed.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the wearing of the helmet
The Michelin tyre manufacturer, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of the helmet, mainly among younger motorists, both entities reported today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, since it is the only element of protection capable of avoiding head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing increasingly safe products" and said it also contributes to this goal through other pedagogical and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet on the motorcycle, under the motto 'To be not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since being a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop increasingly safe products.
The sale of light commercials rises
Nearly two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units that registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% over 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of the manufacturers Anfac and that of sellers Ganvam.
The good data, not osmwesome, should be quarantined since the reference with which the comparison is made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease from the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound in the last month, enrolments accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous financial year.
Since January 95,853 units have been sold in all the vehicles that make up the tailor's drawer of light commercials: derivatives of cars, pick-ups, vans, light vans and light trucks/chasis.
Also, the clouds that most affect their demand have not disappeared, because although they are also acquired by private individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of the cases through external financing.
So to the restrictions of the closed tap of bank credits, we must add other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the economic poor situation.
In the face of this scenario and unlike passenger cars, aid for the purchase of 2000E has been of little use.
In addition to individuals, the self-employed and SMEs that are going to acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions of not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, can be used for them, but the number of operations has been testimonial.
Yesterday, from Ganvam they recalled again the need to devote special attention from the Administration to these vehicles and also to the industrialists (trucks and buses).
The sellers' association forecasts a 2010 similar to the end year, for which it estimates a drop in sales (of cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is already mandatory
As with the ABS brake-blocking and will go through the ESP stability control, emergency braking support systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all cars and light commercial vehicles of new registration, while for the rest a period of deficiency is set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians, although, because of their way of working, it can also help to avoid many collisions by range.
The emergency brake assistant what it does is increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects through the tram of the driver.
But this one doesn't always keep that pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by car component manufacturer Bosch, a third of drivers involved in an accident had not stepped on the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum to the braking system, reducing the distance used by the car to stop.
According to an EU study itself, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four casualties with damage to people would be avoided - when so-called intelligent emergency braking systems are popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps him by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays plan for Opel until January
While the workers of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - the 8th probably - according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that he will need more time to finalize the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, intends is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document to be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
Instead, GM says a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the option of Dutch sports car maker Skyper, which is backed by Russian group Converg, becomes strong.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some assets from Saab to the Chinese Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year is maintained if it is not sold.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop their last, and expensive jewelry, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as their base and managed to thin no less than 80 kilos, which has left the scale at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to dispense, in the first place, with the automatic roof that has been supplied by one of canvas with manual drive, saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors such as those of the GT3, 'fall' another 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, they earned 7 kilos more; mounting sports bacquets another 12 and with light tires of 19 inches, five.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system contributed another six kilograms and changing the door pulls to one of the fabric, the remaining kilo.
Although also offered with the double-clutch PDK change, the test was conducted on a unit with the six-speed manual box, mainly on California secondary roads, on mountain stretches with truly reversed layouts
Their behaviour can only be described as unblemished.
Weight reduction does not mean that the car does not step on the asphalt with aplomb.
Quite the contrary: we hadn't tried such a small and light model for a long time that, at the same time, it transmitted so much safety in the curved pass, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles in a short gear for as long as necessary, until we order him to sprint, to slow down, to recover and squeeze his engine again...
Whatever we ask. Thanks to your address, as communicative as it is accurate, what we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Sound of the engine at will
The sound of his V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already premiered previously in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether from standing or in recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not tough or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was quite grounded, but the car digested the potholes well.
The electronic aids barely made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, well in the morning.
Ultimately, an ultralight car, one of the funniest to drive that one can on the market and that is more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be put on sale in February 2010, priced at 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
An intimate Karl Lagerfeld, image of the line Coco Cocoon and 'starlette' occasional of the parades of the 'maison', the singer prodigates her face with as much contumacy as her Chanel bags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's a 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant victory by 82-91 on its visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra court, despite the numerous casualties that Dusko Ivanovic's team had, and in this way it is in the lead of his group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, which with eight triples scored was the best of his team (29 efficiency).
The Vitorian team was able to replace the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with great doses of involvement and collective work although it had to suffer until the end to take the victory.
In addition, the great success from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored had a lot to do with the final triumph.
The match began face-to-face for the Azulgranas, who put themselves ahead from the start on the scoreboard.
That the first four baskets of the Vitorians went from the perimeter already foreshadowed that they had jumped on the Israeli court with the hot wrists..
English and Teletovic were the main architects of 18-20 at the end of the first partial.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alava team opted for Barac's inner game and Eliyahu's work, which was greeted with dicks and applause on the return to which he was home, to continue extending his advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although Splitter's 'less six' valuation already foretelled that this was not going to be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the game, despite being on track to rest, was not decided much less and the Maccabeos wanted to remind the Vitorians that on their court no one wins, and with 'Elias' hand' squeezing they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the 'yellows' turning around the bright (50-49).
More drawbacks
Ivanovic's, injured but not dead, needed to spin a couple of successful moves to catch air, and in that came Mirza Teletovic's machine gun, which with three triples almost consecutive and the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring income (54-67), which managed to make up the venues at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alaveses went out to leave their skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they were not going to let anyone take away what they had deserved for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, their team's best, did not re-sign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by faults, Ivanovic's did not rush, they defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the match already owned it and the victory escaped from Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost dramatically in Greece to Olympiacos and ceded the lead of Group B of the Euroleague, in a match marked by the casualties of the drawers, especially in the inner game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the pavilion of Peace and Friendship and neither was the entity of the rival, perhaps of the most powerful in Europe and with a great budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from Omar Cook base and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the inner game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, when an action, conato de fight, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, meant the disqualification of both players.
The Greek ensemble began to function showing its superiority within both areas, where the injury drop of the English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal faults were hurting the drawers.
Among the indoor players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
An impossible date
The third period was very offensive with Olympiacos, which despite the 19 losses, was superior and even equalized the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which shook the lead of the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last descent of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all the inconveniences Unicaja for Cook's management and triples, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because Olympiacos when it tightened and given its superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to go back the basket average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja went out, handing the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new Trovit app, the search engine with the largest number of classified real estate, employment and engine ads in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculates users' salaries from more than 140. 000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, based on a form available on Facebook, where they must introduce their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application is in operation, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid," Trovit's head of product, Albert Ribera, explained in a statement.
According to Trovit's data from his search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the lowest paid.
A British computer programmer charges 45,226 gross euros per year and one French, 31,059, compared to 24,000 a Spanish one receives.
Similarly, a driver charges 34,247 euros net per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid work in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by the dependent, with 14,725 euros; and that of operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are that of driver, half-time jobs and that of social workers.
Brazil sets a date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set the deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed President must leave the diplomatic legation by 27 January 2010, when he would officially complete his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, in charge of business at the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he has to seek another destiny."
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya said he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
This week, however, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by rejecting Zelaya's status as a political asylum seeker intended to impose on him by the "de facto" government presided over by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you so much.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring when asset inflation has been the dominant tonic in the markets, uncertainty again reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising as it is its natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by an uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt with direct asset purchase and indirectly giving liquidity-free bar at rates close to zero for financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have almost ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are beginning to throw some sand in the gears as the ECB did with its auction next week.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain the economic recovery without such heterodox measures and are witnessing a reversal of risk premiums.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spread spreads have rebounded, although they remain far removed from the paranormal levels they reached earlier this year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the wanted haven by investors, causing an extension of the spreads of eurozone countries compared to Germany.
Spain had barely been affected by this episode of instability but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened a further downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not bad to silence the moral risk advocates who were once again trying to raise awareness of those responsible for global economic policy for having curbed the destructive effects of credit restrictions on job destruction, when what should be done is decree a new Thanksgiving.
However, Dubai paints a tribal struggle between the Emirs to recompose power in the Emirates and Greece's we have seen before.
A government that hides public deficits, elections and a new government pulling the blanket.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Duro Barroso.
There is no point in Ecofin saving Hungary from a breach of its external payments earlier this year and that it will allow a euro member country to fail to meet its commitments.
What makes sense is that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to make its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt spreads expand just as European corporate bonds we must not worry.
If European spreads diminish and ours continue to expand, then it would be Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review their scenario upwards by 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not augur much from life expectancy to their warning.
Again, it looks like it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the moment "prudence, driver friend."
Related sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommission of the Congress of Deputies in which Spain's energy strategy is being debated these days in the next two decades.
After his speech, followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some brushstrokes of what he had raised in the subcommission behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros until 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 2030, provided that nuclear power plants are kept open today.
If not, the necessary investments will not be 60 billion, but as much as 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be used to increase capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and in international interconnections
From 2020, the issue changes and the power will have to be increased.
His bet focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 MW new are needed, but with other "support energies."
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act just passed by the government is in line with what his company has been demanding, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "point" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are long-term, should begin to be made as they take time to mature and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus' 'handling' at ten airports
Ferrovial's subsidiary for airport services on land, Swissport, will play the role of preferred partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports where it has a presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most prominent.
The agreement, of which the economic terms have not been transcended, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Innovation Center for Smart Infrastructures
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the work of the centre will be to investigate energy efficiency in motorways and airports.
Acciona contests its first motorway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
He is bidding for his first concession highway in Australia, a market where he already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at A$1.7 billion (about 1.047 million euros).
French Bouygues and German Hochtief are her rivals.
A five-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast has become the closest option for Acciona to nod in the country as a builder and motorway dealer.
The City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to advance the project, in a business plan guarded by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to take over the work and exploit the toll.
Pending the submission of their bids next May, the planned investment amounts to A$1.7 billion (1,047 million euros) and in the last phase three consortia with the presence of European construction companies compete.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in liza, and his companions are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest builders, while the second, based in Italy, is one of Europe's largest specialists in underground works.
Against the Acciona team plays the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the screening is the so-called LBRJV, where the Australian capital Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the also local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specializing in civil work Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major works and privatisations, but carries a clear difficulty of entry if not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and that continues to be a pending subject for the Spanish giants of the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millionaire assets
It is committed to a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, that of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies in charge of lifting and managing the Adelaide desaladora, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention now is to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and operation fields of infrastructure.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (northern), is called to join the western Toowong Highway with the ring road in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometres of tunnel. This is the biggest performance to reduce congestion in Brisbane's traffic.
The calendar set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December next year.
Although this payment step would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will contribute A$500 million (308 million euros) to its funding.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear significant fruit to Hochtief, which yesterday announced the achievement of a contract with the Government valued at 154 million.
The ACS involved will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This action will offer rapid internet access to 400,000 people and give the German job for 18 months.
The company has also passed on the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were yet to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale at 129 million.
Already in the UK, specifically in Manchester, it will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC awards tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a motorway from Slovenia in the amount of 64.5 million euros.
The firm gets this contract days after the works of extension of the Bosruck Tunnel (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in the construction of tunnels.
Work is scheduled to begin in early 2010 and its implementation period will be extended for 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore is awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services over the next two years to Ms. Rushmore for an estimated three million euros a year, the rail operator reported.
The contract includes the possibility of two 12-month extensions each. Mrs. Rushmore has been chosen from the 16 agencies that ran for the contest called by Renfe, four of which were finalists, including TBWA that was responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on it will be Mrs. Rushmore is in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
Fine of 63 million to France Télécom for curbing competition
The competition regulator in France has fined France Télécom 63 million euros for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony with the signing of exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programmes to consumers outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state company accumulates more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for hindering its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the authority that ensures competition considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore a repeatist.
App store
On the other hand, the mobile subsidiary of the French company has followed the wake of other operators and has opened an app store on the Internet, with the aim of increasing revenue that does not come from voice transmission.
In principle, Orange's app store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for it to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions has reported 476,4 million to Madrid and Bara since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for the clubs since he was born in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476,4 million since then, making them the third and fifth club that has earned the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League doesn't just provide glory. It is also one of the main sources of revenue for the big clubs.
So much so, that the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/93 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona have come out well off this deal.
The white club has been the third on the continent to pocket the most money for participating, and the only one, along with AC Milan, which has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992, is fifth in the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, more money billed for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both to Bara.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has made the most money through the Champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by UEFA's complicated money-sharing procedure.
For this exercise, the body headed by Michel Platini plans to enter 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money UEFA will dedicate 413,1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous round of classification (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million only for being there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each party they dispute.
There is also bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for tying (400,000 for each team). The eighth finalists will receive three million each; the eight quarterfinalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will pocket 4 million each.
The champion will earn 9 million, compared to 5.2 million of the finalist.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Bara, on the other hand, pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also the variable payments, to which 337,8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the main, and has four assigned places.
The previous year's champion is left with 40 per cent of the money allocated, 30 per cent for the second, 20 per cent for the third and 10 per cent for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year's edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The group Nueva Rumasa yesterday unveiled the details of the offer to buy shares with which it aims to acquire a ceiling of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not force you to launch a public takeover offer (opa) for all titles.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share to be disbursed in 10 years and which would be remunerated with an interest in that postponement of 1% per year
Yesterday Sos' shares closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 councillors.
The Jerez group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, despite the fact that Ruiz Mateos' company stated that it had contacted the regulator.
If realized, the disbursement would reach 611,7 million when Sos' capitalization is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his direction.
In an attempt to stay out of possible offers of purchase and the judicial swings of their former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, he announced the election of María Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food company.
This is a newly created post that will depend directly on the group's president.
And it is not without controversy, as the company remains embroiled in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar companies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos unveils new diversions of funds
Regarding credit to the Salazars, yesterday former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared yesterday and stated that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their fate.
CNMV authorizes the exclusion opa of Paternina presented by Inversora Mer
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorized the exclusion opa presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation on the understanding that its terms comply with the current rules and consider "sufficient" the content of the explanatory brochure presented following the amendments introduced on 2 December.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Stock Exchanges of Madrid and Bilbao.
He also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been frozen, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the end of the offer, of which he specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current regulations.
New tools to persecute cars
In these days of storms and accidents, not only do car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a sinister are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No sinister is the same, and the calculation of parts costs and manpower time can be a long and complicated task.
Calculating the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including pieces and handwork, can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools it would be a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of the experts use this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for valuation of claims and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided to them by manufacturers, and then developing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the valuations are made with its products.
The other firms competing in the field of the sector's valuation and information-making tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Work on the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them supplies them with the information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the point that more versions, variants and motorizations have been released over the past five years than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car goes on the market, these companies get to work.
It is a very arduous task, because each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle must be catalogued and its price introduced.
In addition, from each model a "smart" graphic image is made where different parts of tourism can be "painted."
If it's a sales model, the job can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it's a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars that are marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models there is information about Porsche, but not from Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park circulating, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the development of the databases, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually experts in mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million per year in the production of these databases.
2.5 million data are included each month, and customers receive updates every two days.
The preparation of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer varied products.
The most frequent use is on repair and maintenance, but depending on which countries there are also tools for managing scrapping parts or calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of those used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex it is easy to get an idea of the type of support they can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard disaster valuation solution, intended for experts.
Includes cars, motorbikes and light or heavy commercial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is paid according to use, for each valuation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which carries out thousands of experts, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass is concentrated in the moons of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows to bid for vehicles declared total sinister.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analyses or know deviations by ormodels.
You can study, for example, how many models of a certain brand have passed through the workshop due to breakdowns or how many have suffered serious casualties over a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It markets, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a service provider and solutions for the valuation of damage, breakdowns or maintenance of the car
The Gt Appraisance Guide is its historical reference product in the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has grown at a rate of 20% per year in the last three years, and in 2008 they billed 10.8 million euros.
Early last year they began their internationalization process, with the installation of an office in Paris.
For its part, Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and in 1979 it was established in Spain.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country the company will enter 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange, and its shares are now listed for a total value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and has been listed in the benchmark Standard & Poor's index.
Internet upstairs of crashed cars
Last October the Solera group bought Autoonline, an internet platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or sinister special vehicles.
The operation involved a disbursement of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The aim of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This valuation and sale service is aimed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, scrapyards and professional sellers who must register before starting to carry out operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered vendors and 4,000 experts.
3,000 advertisements are managed per day and about 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose frame number has been discharged cannot be re-routed, but certain parts that are not damaged can be used as a spare.
Cars with historical value can be discharged even if they have been discharged after a few farater efforts.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex guarantees that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, look for the replacement, create budget and generate budget.
The ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who are often more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 cars, 109 SUVs, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it requires a computer with internet connection.
Once the model to be repaired using its frame number has been identified, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the workforce, surcharges or discounts, and then can print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an assessment tool like AudaPlus, but rather a catalogue of references.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented one does not include estimated labour times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
Audatex is currently working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
