Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
Ukraine's parliament today rejected a proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the release of the former prime minister, but MPs rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly signing an agreement with Russia disadvantageous to Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The sentence is not yet final, the appeal court has the obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that this was a political vendetta by the regime, and even in the West doubts have been raised about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Penal Code convicting the former prime minister was supported by 147 MPs in the vote.
For its adoption, 226 votes were required.
Libya's victory
The history of Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war.
It remains to be defined who is the winner
As is customary in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it is a question of whether they are moderates or radicals.
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, Sharia, which we already know to some extent.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because thieves will have their hands cut off.
Women can already forget about emancipation and apostates await their execution and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, society, composed of warring tribes, will be united by the Koran.
In Libya, an order will be established that we cannot even imagine and that we certainly cannot imagine.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and probably did not suit the Libyans mentioned above.
The truth is that it is surprising that the Islamic fighters gratefully accepted the help of the infidel dogs.
The only justification was that, in their view, NATO attacks were not led by an American general, but great be Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When they look for victors in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a shootout that Islamists and our politicians use to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally with no guarantee of profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we did not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the locals do not have a problem to expel the "crusaders"
But, without occupation, will the oil companies be able to get hold of Libyan black gold only with good words?
Quite possibly not, but it may be that the West can finally boast of protecting human rights.
As long as the followers of Sharia do not cross us.
A new era of crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe are on the hunt for the investor finder
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
Individual states have released their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the quarter-on-quarter period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors no longer look only to Italy, but also to Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by an expected 0.5%, France's by 0.4%
Both countries have published the data for the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the expected 0.1%), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew year-on-year by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the quarter-on-quarter period, the gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to the ČSÚ the trend towards a gradual slowdown in the growth of economic development is formed.
The results are even worse than analysts' forecasts.
Main events:
Year-on-year, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but has stagnated quarterly.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy has fallen year-on-year by 5.2%.
The interest on its ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
Interest on Italian and Spanish bonds has risen to critical limits.
The problematic situation is also beginning to affect Austria, Holland, France, Belgium, etc.
Yields on Czech ten-year bonds remain at 4%, although the situation in the area is worsening.
In Germany, voices are being raised that the ECB should ultimately lend.
The Czechs qualify for the European Championship.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the qualification with a premium 200 million.
The football team fulfills the most difficult task of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and the brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jiráček, the victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended fantastically from the attacks of the home team, so they will not miss the appointment of the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed in detail the development of the match in a detailed report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the home team towards the end, and also the excellent play of Čech and the heroic Jiráček, won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its passage to the European Championship.
Because of the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two losers of the match were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who missed two great chances.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech eleven will not miss the appointment of the European Cup, so the coffers of national football will receive an approximate reward of 200 million crowns.
Already from the first minutes there was a good offensive game.
Both teams insisted only on maintaining the lines and played nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from the home players in the first half, kicks to the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense knew how to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they want to express their support for their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began praying Tuesday at noon outside the facility and then chanted death slogans to the U.S. and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around the uranium-based nuclear technology center in the Iranian city of Isfahan on Tuesday.
They intend to show that they are willing to defend their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, according to all indications, is striving to obtain nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon outside the Isfahan nuclear facility and then hurled death slogans against the U.S. and Israel.
In the event of an attack, whose objective would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear program, it would reach, according to Israeli sources, not only the Isfahan plant, but also the Natanz facilities, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner sausages
More than a third of children aged between 9 and 13 years have problems of overweight, where overweight affects 9% of the school population and obesity 5%.
Obese children mostly come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, according to current research.
It is again demonstrated what is the importance of the environment where it grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obese children eat, for example, sausages at least twice as often as children from normal-weight families.
For dinner, more than 19% of obese people had eaten chips the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence."
In families of overweight children there is no habit of practicing sports, which is applicable to most families today, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of the last school year and involved almost 900 basic education children from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the "Obesity is not a coincidence" program, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and the Unilever company.
So far, more than 12 thousand children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th grade.
An adequate diet and plenty of exercise as a family are determining factors, which significantly reduce the number of overweight and even obese children.
"Only half of the children surveyed have answered that they have five meals a day according to the regime: breakfast, lunch, lunch, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," reads one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast but with cold meat for dinner
Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, the details are also important, which also count, such as having a fixed time for breakfast with the family.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of schoolchildren's families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to discover that in 10% of households nothing is breakfast.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that in families of obese children, unhealthy French fries are consumed much more frequently.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet soft drinks daily (70%).
As a general rule, more than 40% of the children surveyed play sports, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Prepare your diet
The next phase of the study made it possible for the chosen kids (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15, from the point of view of healthy eating, are far from ideal."
Among her favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"The popularity of sweet soft drinks is especially alarming," warns the final report of the study.
As the main meal, the pasta takes the cake and is closely followed by poultry.
Practically, children always reject the legume and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Switching to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
"In the control group of the participants in the study, who filled out the questionnaire after finishing the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence", there was in many cases an important change in favor of the principles of a healthy diet," says the results of the study.
It is striking, for example, what is related to sweet drinks, where many children would begin to prefer normal and running water.
Children would also choose poultry and fish for the main meal more frequently in the questionnaire and restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In the introductory article, How Stylists Learn, I already complained a bit that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Lectures by three professionals in the field, how to dress problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of entertainment.
And it will be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer room for a pin.
We have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) on how to dress the woman who does not have perfect symmetry.
And so is the vast majority.
Someone is short-necked, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves and someone is overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given certain tricks on how to make the body stand out for women of the type of Jennifer Lopez, with huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not dress it in a too challenging way.
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so much that the skirt or pants do not fit, it is worth having at least an extra piece of fabric sewn to measure.
They certainly won't regret it, because the clothes you feel perfectly are priceless.
With a custom skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing at the waist, etc.
Stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with pleats, ornaments, embroidery or draping.
There are certainly many kinds of diverse information and bodies, so I'm glad I have the whole week to put all this information in order in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid that with the assigned task, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, to whom he must design two costumes: one for the day and one for the night.
You have to take into account the current appearance, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
I have had to "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who lately will have gained a hundred kilos (please take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gómez.
The dresses have to be cut out of magazines or searched on the internet and printed, and then graphically elaborated.
The moodboard, which is what the complete result is called, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of the styling.
The stylist, therefore, does not only dress physically, but also deals, for example, with the product pages in magazines (of specific topics, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about all this.
But all this is already for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three specialist guests animated Saturday's conference with information on all types of bodies.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, the so-called trench coat (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed in the classic with jeans and t-shirt, but also serves to dress the naked body with heels and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just roll up your sleeves and raise your neck to get a totally different image.
"Play with it," he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To start working, you need to know all the rules first."
"Then you can break them," Jakub said.
Finally it is clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the reserve than they intend to photograph.
Thus, for a fashion story that has ten pages (therefore, ten outfits), you have to have prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And also that the photos the clothes work in combination with other garments, all of them different from those used in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that image and style alone are, in many cases, half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, at the moment, there is still no clear trend to use the services of stylists.
Even famous people also find it useless (my skills are enough, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, we must bear in mind that it is very likely that they indicate a size very different from their real (smaller).
Then it remains only to guglear and find out if the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has gained weight / slimmed, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not enough to orient himself in fashion, but that he has to understand the outfit.
During your work, you should especially communicate with the people you dress, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he does not miss it, he defends their opinions.
"When a director hires you to sort out the costumes and complete it with nice clothes, you can't take and throw away everything there was and say, 'Wow what a horror.'"
"Find at least a couple of things that you can ponder and recommend so that someone can wear them," says Mario.
He himself also showed us that everything must fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the job board.
This is fixed around the waist and all the necessary tools are there.
They are objects such as scissors, like scissors, removers, or safety pins. There is also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo shoot of products such as bags or hats), special clips for attaching garments in front, if this is larger (pins and other types of hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a sewing set.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to coat the soles of our shoes.
Even during photo shoots in the studio, on a flat surface, you could damage the sole and even more the outside.
And we did nothing but clothe and coat.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the scissors so as not to damage them by accident.
So you had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy by praising my work without reservation.
The truth is that I am not very good at those skills.
This is only a small part of everything we have heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've already realized that dedicating myself to styling on a professional level is not a rosy path, but I don't care exactly what people say.
Need for Speed: The Run competes all over America.
Review
A trip, initially carefree, is complicated by a series of oversights unbecoming of a routine trip during the morning shift.
To some extent expectations were met, but that is useless if, in fact, nothing extraordinary was intended.
The new installment, to which The Run is added to the title, aroused great expectations even before its premiere.
It promised that it would give new airs to the old racing saga Need for Speed and, as a result of what was shown, it appears as a game that should not end up being an action genre again.
We are also curious to know what the inserted scenes would look like, where the main character gets out of the car and walks on his own foot.
As often happens in NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be considered acceptable, but in the total calculation points are lost because of absurd failures, which have already been appearing in the series for years.
In reality, they cannot even be called errors, but rather the incomprehensible reluctance of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to participate in an illegal race throughout America.
You sit behind the wheel on the West Coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place along a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
That way, one doesn't even remotely get the feeling that the game always offers the same thing.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the graphic is equivalent to that of previous installments of the series.
Therefore, it is nothing to write home about.
But the walk through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow-capped mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, careers are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you have to be careful not to be buried by an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, you try to overtake a required number of rivals (normal in a classic race), then you try to gain time (classic timed duel) and then a duel awaits you against a single opponent.
In the midst of all this, sometimes the police appear, which only makes things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game than you would expect (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of previous episodes.
That means that today it is no longer a big deal, but it cannot be said that it is bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a race conceived with enough action suits this style of driving, although we can find something better among the games of the competition.
So far, so good.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correctness of driving models, collisions are no longer the case.
Games of this type can not be expected to recreate deformations and complicated collisions, but in fact before a hit against any object, you can not predict how your car will react, so not everything is in order.
It is typical that, when making a very tight overtaking or driving the car with normal traffic, there are only slight frictions, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up doing uncontrolled pirouettes.
Or it even ends up totally destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no big problems arise, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are programmed in such a way that, when you suffer an accident or leave the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each race there are only five resets available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it is nothing more than a help in case something does not go well, but it is not very reliable.
Sometimes, even the reset does not help, it only helps to learn the given stage by heart.
A big disadvantage of the game is that the same events are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find "civilian" vehicles somewhere always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes rage especially in situations, when you see that two cars that go to the meeting in opposite directions, your opponent overtakes without problems, but when you arrive, you must turn or brake.
It is the same when you arrive, because it is programmed because the "surprise" will always happen right under your nose.
Adversaries also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will reach places where, regardless of the moment, you will always be overtaken by the same opponent in the same place.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming from the front, so at first you can make porridge of the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that you will surely be disappointed immediately.
And it's a shame, because although the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and actionable, so it is often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn't matter, if the merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the classification in the race so that there is no room for boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during races.
You have to be attentive to the gas pumps on the side of the road, because right there you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases what you have will suffice.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight highways and exotic supercars for technical driving, for example on curvy mountain roads.
In addition to the main narrative thread, a parallel challenge thread also appears, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know from the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
When reaching the upper level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog function is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and makes other community functions available.
One of the hardest elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you reach the metro tunnel (pass), where you start running in the dark on the tracks (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km / h (pass) and, suddenly, from behind you the subway convoy arrives and takes you ahead without further ado.
In the newsroom we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one thought even a little or if the authors really take us for a bunch of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects are in most cases pleasant, sometimes even superb.
Well, what a pity that, in the most tense moments, the image quality is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This especially affects accidents where many participants are involved, when the continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for its music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble claiming that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not finished.
Fun is guaranteed, but be prepared because mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the force of airport reflectors.

The Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
Czechs have a reputation as negativists and Eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't expect an all-out war to be mounted."
"It will last five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a bit, calms down and the new players get used to their new roles," began Czech Ambassador to the EU Milena Vicenová with conviction in her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
How can we not take seriously his motto "clearly and openly about Europe", which he said already in the first part of his lecture, when he managed to describe each organ of the EU and its relations with such precision and clarity, because it would be the envy of many lecturers of the Faculty of Law of the U. Carolina.
Vicenová also praised the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first thing comes the criticism, that if it is bland, a gray official, capable of assuming any role, but I have to say that he left everyone baffled, because he assumes his roles perfectly."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them and who has a very clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new post of representative of Foreign and Security Policy is explained by the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call?" It is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of political union vis-à-vis states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban Olomouc cheese
Vicenová has also dealt with the agenda, which the European Council will follow, follow and will follow in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has many commitments at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good fuss", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, the EU's seven-year budget, caused by the current economic situation, which is much more complicated, must be approved.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will be prioritized, which countries will receive the most support, and which will receive the least? That is something that will be on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe clearly".
"The truth is that I don't like ugly abbreviations, foreign words or jargons that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels cucumbers are not really invented, curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that nobody is going to ban us from Olomouc cheese?"
It also aims to make more of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of speeds awaits us
According to the ambassador, Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics and people perceive the negative aspects rather than the positives.
In addition, he regretted the low participation of Czechs in the European institutions.
The fault lies with a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the lack of support from the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me that when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches me, a Frenchman next to me says: 'What, have you already stayed, those of the Visegrad Group?', and you can see that he is not amused. "
In the future, according to Vicenová, the EU has new tough budgetary policy regulations for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, more than the new one of "the European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"It was said for the first time that only the countries that want to cooperate and those that do not, that they stay out."
"These procedures will be more and more and will strengthen the Europe of the two speeds," Vicenová is expected.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the application of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the whole of the EU should be discussed among member states, not only among members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone were looking for a term that defined IBM's strategy with great precision, the closest would be "long-term."
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and, nevertheless, a hundred years have passed since its founding.
The basis of this long-term character was laid by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the motto that many of the world's problems can be solved if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his hallmark, around which the life of the future giant will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully built company culture.
"For us, IBM implies long-term thinking, a continuous movement in the direction of the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years for that reason, because it stayed true to its core principles, but without fear of changes all around.
That has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We look forward to further thriving in our second century," said Samuel J. Palmisano, current company director during its anniversary.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 30s, was concerned with the care of his employees as the entrepreneur of Baťa in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first American workers who enjoyed paid vacations, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system that rewarded the best inventors and salespeople.
The same long-term sophistication is maintained by IBM in the customer relationship.
From the beginning the company knew how to discover talents (being one of the first companies in the world to end any type of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM's current plan, whereby Palmisano will be replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working for thirty years at IBM, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategy.
During the last years IBM has participated in the so-called virtual meetings, online brainstorming, from which countless future strategies and innovations arise.
It is not surprising that there are too many ideas, since almost half a million people work in the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of an institution rather than a technology company," says Rosabeth Moss Kanter, an economist professor at Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company trying to solve business problems for technology users," says George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the business and directly creating a business.
IBM - or the "Big Green" - as it is known in the US familiarly because of its logo, has become in the last hundred years one of the largest companies in the world.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (it develops both equipment and programs, infrastructures and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the largest number of patents of any American technology company and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among his inventions are the ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, barcodes and floppy disks.
IBM will invoice 220 billion dollars this year. This year it has become the second technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations just satisfy customers' tastes and timing (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
"If your business is based on moving forward, you can't emotionally anchor yourself in the past," Samuel J. Palmisano acknowledged.
That's why IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and likewise, if they don't work, it abandons them).
And this differentiates it from the competition, Microsoft, which basically stays and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the future
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which approximately one-fifth are programs and a fifth are equipment.
However, even in 1990 equipment accounted for more than half of the suppliers' share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold underperforming assets worth a total of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first manifested itself.
IBM acts according to the premises of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investments.
It seems that so far the IBM company has been able to weather the crisis.
The value of IBM shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospherically to 120%, the net profit of the company has not stopped increasing.
IBM's currency is to change everything except its value.
One can therefore expect that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will hold on.
IBM History: From the Cheese Slicer to Spaceflight
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The IBM name was adopted as early as 1924 - originally it was a brand used in branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation that gave rise to IBM's birth stems from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He owned inventions such as the famous "clock", which allows you to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its supervisory board.
Flint hired the head of a competing company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The new leader eclipsed IBM's founder (Watson's ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are built).
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began producing and selling everything from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During Watson's first four years at the helm, turnover doubled by $9 million and the company's vast expansion across continents began.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, almost forty years in the boss's chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 60s IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights into space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "fish", which established the computer standard of that time, came to market under the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, in turn, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer a complete advice and services of high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid for these last three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, "a smarter planet".
Its aim is to make more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned or circumstances have improved, for example in terms of transport and city management.
For the commerce sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smart Commerce" platform that allows retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 it opened a branch in Czechoslovakia at the time, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Here today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Also here is a world-famous research team working with speech recognition.
Rychtářová on her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay that donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina was still hopeful that Josef would wake up from his pink sleep and return home.
However, he will no longer wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can come home, but I don't like my partner anymore," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová welcomed Bartošové into her home during the summer, she could not have imagined how their marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after Říčany and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly stated that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned herself, seemingly accepting her husband's relationship, and even saying goodbye to him forever.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If one day Rychtář broke up with Bartošová, his wife would not wait for him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children, and if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will kick him out."
"But here I would live not as my dear old donkey who made a mistake, but as a man to whom I have certain ties," Rychtářová said, adding that she had already disengaged from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef so far doesn't care that his wife has closed the back door to him.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I will be with Iveta and there is no change possible."
"My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect that."
"The company is still in force, I do the house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping."
"Darina and I talk normally, the only thing is that we don't share a bed," Rychtář said.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he would not object.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't care me, where she is going or if she has a boyfriend.
I already know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility," concludes Josef.
Women's worst vices: Do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to cite some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourselves in the following lines, where certain feminine vices are cited that manage to make the blood of men boil?
Shopping
Do you reproach your better half for being dependent on shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one rag a week?
Do you like to shop often at sales?
So in your case you can say that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But let's see, what woman could resist the temptation to simply walk through clothing stores, look for tight clothes and then try them all on in the fitting room (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can practically become hell.
Just remember how many times you have already told your partner that he better wait for you in front of the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
"Isn't I too fat?"
"I would need to lose at least five pounds – should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like me?"
Don't these phrases ring a bell?
Don't you?
So she's one of those women obsessed with her looks.
It's not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing their partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleanliness first
It's like an infinite merry-go-round.
Cleaning the windows, vacuuming, scrubbing the floor, dusting, scrubbing the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you reproach your partner for stepping on the clean floor with a dirty foot, your children for soiling a freshly cleaned sink and a shelf with glass doors that you worked so hard to clean?
In case you suffer from this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should surely not occupy themselves as paramount in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Making nasty comments
"Used underpants are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to wear those used socks tomorrow too"
"The wet rag is not left on the ground!"
If you make those comments to your partner more times a day, know that this will get him out of his boxes.
Naturally. You don't want to say anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make as many comments.
Slander and gossip
Some women also like slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us sometimes misses a small and harmless gossip.
With the hand on the heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossiping women who do not control themselves, who love to gossip and do it often, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female work team.
Jágr and Voráček helped beat Philadelphia with their assists
Hockey forward Jaromír Jágr took part in the NHL game on Monday with two assists that brought victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on the court in Carolina and puts Czech players back at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star's move, and went a step further and was declared best player of the match.
He was awarded two assists in the match and also Jágr's teammate, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jágr told reporters overseas that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"I had already told him before the game that he would make a hat-trick."
"I sensed it."
"Sometimes they look like ambushes," Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the Flyers' first shot.
A while later also the second intervention of the team had a Czech trace.
Voráček took the puck behind the Hurricanes' goal and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was sent off, but from the beginning of the second half the Flyers already dominated.
Specifically by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr he scored the third goal, after his shot slipped through the fourth of Wayne Simmonds' goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player on the pitch, but he's certainly in the top three," Jágr told his centre-back.
"It would never have occurred to me that at the end of my career I was going to play with an athlete like him."
"I am very satisfied with it."
"I want to play for him."
All these years in the NHL, my teammates played for me, and that now produces results," adds Jágr.
Carolina still turned the match into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu's goal and then Dwyer's penalty, again getting within a goal of distance.
Matt Read allowed no more complications, although they ended up outnumbering two to one.
"Pronger had a good performance on our field."
"He cleared the disc, I picked up speed and Read went to the farthest part."
"I tried to hit the record and I'm happy because I got it," Voráček described the last goal of the game as he lived it.
With its victory, Philadelphia has moved into the lead of the Eastern Conference.
Montreal's Czech defender Jaroslav Špaček did not play until the end of the game against Buffalo, in the second third he retired with an upper body injury.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of experience on defense, but also by a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec did not know how to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach lamented the large number of injuries in the back row, and play the game with only five defenders.
"That's bad."
"We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were newcomers."
"Anyway, but nothing can be done against that, we have to deal with it," Jacques Martin said.
"So much rotating the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify the game even more, get the puck out of our field."
"And so we leave gaps," explained one of the defenders, P.K. Subban.
Goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg appearances in a 5–2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals were scored by five players that ended a string of losses that had already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies of that time sold in most cases trips only to the socialist bloc, since travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea) Bulgaria and Romania (both on the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when travel to Yugoslavia could be traveled, however, afterwards the Yugoslav regime leaned westwards and the travel of Czech tourists was then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even in socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West at that time, but one had to queue up with a sleeping bag and spend the whole night, or have "good acquaintances" in the agency.
Still, not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" that was the condition for travel to the West was not granted to "politically unreliable people," who thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, with no guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The way of travelling of the Czechs has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 it was the only time spent holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria for us, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware, that the current favorite destination, Croatia, until 1989 could not travel freely, because it was part of the Yugoslavia of that time.
At the beginning of the 90s, visa-free travel to neighbouring Western European states was imposed, which led to a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not look fed up with excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris groups of Czechs slept in parks in tents, since our income at that time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or pension.
A typical characteristic of the Czechs of that time was to take with them the food (preserves, sausages, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech koruna, so that our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living was rising, and so were average wages, which around 1997 led to an increase in demand for travel.
With the increase in travel demand, agencies began regularly preparing for travel using charter connections from 1997 onwards, which dramatically lowered travel prices compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of discounts for passenger volume.
At the end of the 90s of the last century, Czechs were already traveling visa-free to almost all developed countries except the USA, which further simplified our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened already in 2000, when the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country was organized, thanks to a huge demand, and it was to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists depart every year to distant and hot countries. This winter it will already fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, symbolizing our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. eliminated visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008 Czechs, for the first time in their history, spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, more than CZK 15,000 per head were spent on trips abroad, including expenses on the place of stay.
Ordinary General Assembly called to elect the president, which could end up deadlocked again.
For almost five months Czech football has been without a president and it is likely that Ivan Hašek's successor as President of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not be known even after the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, it will not be possible to vote even to choose between the three candidates.
Those interested in presiding over Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned from his post in June, but not before summoning his colleagues in order to find a strong person who would know how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the conclusion of the Hašek era, a controversy broke out between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on 16 September when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní dům), located in the Prague neighborhood of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not only in terms of the method of election.
No consensus was reached as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or also delegates with full powers.
From that moment and because of this single point, there was a partial agreement, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer be shed even by the Executive Committee which, in its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, basically did not resolve anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve center remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid deadlock?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, which, from the direction of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round the candidate with the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will present his candidacy will win.
The Moravian Region is willing to reach a compromise so that the candidate with the highest total percentage of votes in both federations can win.
The Bohemian part, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two-thirds.
"This would, however, detract from the meaning of the previous two rounds and completely negate the concept of the bicameral system," is how Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomaš Paclík also agrees with this, although it is assumed that the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates are more suitable for Pelta.
"I would like it to be voted to the maximum according to the statutes."
"Lest any nonsense be invented about representatives like at the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time as a candidate and who directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, in Nymburk the new president will be decided and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will be tempered by today's match of our national team at the European Championship.
"Football will once again be the protagonist, and thus cooperation will be more comfortable," says the representative of Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope an agreement will be reached, but, unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated."
"It's not about the conflict between bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"Anyway, I hope common sense will prevail," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to take place in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others the vice presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not left this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualifying match will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, finally, could be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which, according to what they say, will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the divided parties into the country's most powerful sports organization so that an agreement can be reached.
The stakes are high: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sports Federation (ČSTV) which will try to give a new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclík will fight for the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the Pilsen footballers, Tomaš Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate who satisfied all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), he would not present himself as a candidate for such an important position.
"If there was a suitable person, I would be fighting for her and I would not run for election."
"But to this day it has not been possible to find such a person," Paclík told the Czech News Agency (ČTK).
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the supposed winner of the elections, which opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, if he wins, he would remain in the position of president only until 2013, when it would be the turn of the ordinary general assembly.
In that position he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
"I've already talked to some people I might consider."
"It was crazy for me to hear some say that at the moment they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
"I would like to change that vision," he adds.
What supposedly bothers Paclík most at the moment is Pelta's relationship with Pilsen Regional Football Association President Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting of delegates at the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"Should he win, the status would be maintained and nothing in football will change."
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will get even less out of it," Paclík said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta's name was associated with a wiretap during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta got away with it.
"I don't know what prestige to football Pelta's victory could bring."
"And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us," said Paclík, who also takes with some caution his earlier statement that he would "sell the Pilsen Club if Pelta becomes president."
In the event of winning Thursday's election, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Of the same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would follow."
"He is very capable."
"I could imagine him, for example, as head of the representation."
"But not as a manager of an association."
"I also don't stick my nose in where I don't feel capable," added Paclík, who in September drew a lot of attention for supporting the suspension of the Referees' Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
He draws on his management skills in private companies, since last summer he has also been the Director of Pilsen, which with his support celebrated the victory in the first division in May.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to its safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations," Paclík said without hiding his antipathies towards Sparta president Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it put pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to sport than lottery taxes.
"It's one of the key issues the new president should be working on."
"If they were to raise taxes on gambling, as advertised by political parties, I would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where all this money goes," he says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FAČR should be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"Not ideal."
"But I don't see the point of hypocritically ceding my shares in the Pilsen Club to someone else and then going back there after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised the FAČR new statutes that would break the deadlock in the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would ensure that the FAČR had new statutes that would serve definitively to settle, in the future, disputes regarding electoral regulations.
The Jablonec representative is optimistic about Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Even before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate at the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could do well to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on football management.
"People at all levels have been involved in football for a long time and look forward to meeting the new president on Thursday."
"They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the association," thinks the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked at Sparta and on the association's executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly the statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta warned.
Exactly the readaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a lure to win over the delegates.
"If I am elected president, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am willing to respond in case this fails."
"It's a matter of principle, without which we cannot exist," says Pelta.
Also, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
Already in the past he had warned that he saw himself collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his training in law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It had been a long time since he attacked Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, left no puppet with a head.
"He's been in the football world for over a year, and he's already achieved some success."
"Their attacks were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt his true character," he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced as early as September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the higher ones.
The latter should be a showcase for the promotion of football.
"I would also try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of last year's corruption scandal."
"Immediately afterwards I would get involved in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," the 46-year-old told ČTK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as president of football would not entail any personal modification of the squad.
"I would have to know the tasks of each employee first," he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, understandable nervousness reigns.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are predicted before the next general assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement will be how to vote in the third round, we will certainly get through it.
"Football needs credibility, which will recover only if it finally has a leader," still two days before the most decisive day in his managerial career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership, FAČR would start working hard.
If the fourth General Assembly elects the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl as the new president of the Czech Football Association, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that, if elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement systematic change and make executive committee members accountable for each area of football individually.
It also pledges to resolve the Bohemians' case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, raise more money for football and continue the work started by former president Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I would like to devote myself entirely to football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the national team, through professional football or the training of young high-performance footballers."
"By this I don't mean I would do it all alone," Rajchl said in an interview with ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the competencies of the executive committee in such a way that each member can dedicate themselves to a specific area."
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of momentum."
"A lot of people probably won't like this, because it will mean starting to work really hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he is said to have considered not running again.
"Everyone knows, I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will prevent and hinder me at every step," he explained the reasons for his indecision.
"A lot of people have told me that I shouldn't give up, because then others would give up too."
"It's about having faith not to abandon like this, without further ado," he said.
He is also said to be motivated to continue the work he has already started with Hašek.
"During those two years, a lot of the work was finished that I don't want to be lost now."
"There are processes that had been started and that will have their effect in a couple of years and I would not like someone to stop them," he announced worried that, if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could return to the way it was before the Hašek era.
"I believe in order, and it's something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him is above all those people who would take care of football so that it would only be a privilege for a select few."
"I can be reproached for a lot of things, but not the fact that I'm for someone."
"I try to be objective."
"I want to play football for everyone, because only then will everyone feel good and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
"Although some people try to claim otherwise, I have in mind to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about splitting the second division into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first division."
"There would be no situation where we have only three teams from Moravia, which is a problem for young Moravian players," Rajchl said.
Although Tomaš Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, joined the presidential election, Rajchl does not stop believing in his chances of being elected.
"I still feel I have strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice-president and which knows that behind me there are clear successes," said Rajchl, whose successes include saving tens of millions of crowns from disadvantageous contracts, TV contract negotiations and negotiations over the lottery law.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his share of blame for the federation not being united.
And while he proclaims that Pelta is "disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football," he sees the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year."
"If elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Hašek has already started and would not significantly change the staffing of the committees."
"I don't want to use that to my advantage," Rajchl assesses his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to blue
by Julia Stanek
Pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Visitors to Europe can experience its blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where the best well-being lies in the water.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something she couldn't miss in her luggage, a swimsuit.
Lying on her back on the water, she looked at the artistic dome overhead, swam to the marble angel sharks, which awaited her at the edge of the pool and marveled at the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, he took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor pools in Munich, the historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete constructions" in Taunus.
He made his "trip through the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe" through 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathroom culture enthusiast.
He wants nothing to do with sport, Meder says, only water is different.
It only bothers him that bathers have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine stench, while running enthusiasts can breathe in the fascinating smell of fir forests or hear the cheerful chirps of birds in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools always have to be so ugly," says the Vienna-dweller.
"I started collecting nice pools."
The surface of the water duplicates the architecture.
The splashing in the pool and the ethereal oils of the sauna. The wellness factor in pools is so great because all the senses are catered for, according to Meder.
And if the builder makes an effort, indoor pools can be a real treat for the eyes: "Instead of soil, in bathrooms you have a water surface."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything bends optically: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting facts about architecture and art history in the historical oases of well-being, but, mainly, it makes you want to jump blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the outstanding specimens in her research in Hungary.
Next to the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, there are the waters with nitrates in a unique karst cavity (cavity baths in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as thermal baths, whose pools are alkaline waters and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city sets its eyes on Zurich's indoor pool, you can watch the snow-covered Arlberb from the outdoor swimming pool of a swim in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can watch the practice on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary design awaits customers in Längenfeld: Ötztal's water cathedral looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open fountains steam rises in winter, while in the background the mountains of Ötztal rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, was not invaded by the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the Árpád baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, the diesel plague is so strong that people believe they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from medicinal waters containing baking soda and alkali and whose legum sticks to the skin when entering the pool, an enjoyment of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in one place in her search for pretty bathing spots, when she wanted to visit outdoor pools and sunbathing in the Czech Luhatschowitz bath, she found blocked ground.
The 1902 bath of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw weeds growing among the tiles.
The decay counteracted in a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction behind them; not only can you discover neo-Romanesque elements from the time of its construction in 1844, but also an Arab hall in Alhambra style, added in 1900.
Since its painstaking modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace has been the favorite bath of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not only because it is a native of the Black Forest.
"There's a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit," says Meder.
In such a palace the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not have much importance.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank analyzes the commodity business
By Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its business in agricultural commodities?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg
For citizens, the matter is clear, according to a study, 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents are calling for Deutsche Bank and other lenders to pull out of the business because it intensifies the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges drive up prices, and banks bear responsibility for the global problem of hunger.
The consumer ombudsman's campaign is specifically aimed at Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, bets on commodities were intended to protect traders from price swings.
Leading experts agree that players have decoupled from supply and demand, and profit from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently than U.S. competitors: He vowed to review the claims and said no business "deserves to compromise Deutsche Bank's good reputation."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to Deutsche Bank's board, along with a recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank's management will report the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Bets on rising food prices show especially dramatically how ruthless banks are currently harming public welfare."
Ackermann ranks as the biggest bank lobbyist, especially in bonds.
"Deutsche Bank should cancel all investments in its portfolio where it puts money for food price bets at stake," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann deals with the issue of hungry people or the fame of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to give a perfect picture a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different from what was not planned in the board of directors.
With the abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation it can perfect its image.
And he needs to hardly care about possible losses, that's what his successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would cancel out investment in commodities
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on Nov. 7 and 8.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were wagered.
Many of the bank's customers showed personal consequences upon discovering that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel out all investments from which money comes out of agricultural speculation.
43 percent would advise such a bank against their acquaintances, 49 percent would request, after reflection, to cancel their account and move to another institute.
The 21st house in Vienna
The pavilion moved
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the Austrian Universal Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, stood empty and crumbled.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
Modern postgerra architecture is passionate, clear forms, glass halls, brave curves and new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the Universal Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is a suitable and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then won the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light, floating steel and glass construction.
The construction is considered to this day a contemporary landmark of architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next Universal Exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flattened building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building was erected after the universal exhibition at the Schweizer Garten next to Vienna's South Station, was refurbished in 1962 and inside a 20th century museum was inaugurated, it was called the "20th house".
The building was adequate but lacked the right spaces and technology for a museum; No wall to hang art, no good atmosphere.
Despite this it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is decaying more and more.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz renovated the pavilion, now calls it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the belvedere museum, to which the house belongs, was inaugurated with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, achieved a new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, figure skater in her youth, later at Sotheby, the Guggenheim museum and founding director of the museum of modern art in Salzburg, carried out the reforms at the insistence of politicians and protectors of monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookshop and also an office building built.
Tight control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because he sensitively reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, he expanded it and was awarded the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his move to Vienna in his change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current renovations there are big problems, the building was "an energy eater," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the windows of the glass façade was changed, insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was installed, and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were employed for the new use, a lowered light panel between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the building almost new, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in antique mahogany tones and protected against oxidation.
And the movie theater is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the monuments office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked by the monument protection office," says Krischanitz, warning of rough soil in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and renovations, the building remains flexible and light.
The pavilion "that came from Brussels" has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical "chance appearance in the history of the city."
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and that is why he wanted to "awaken the right consciousness".
In this case house 21 is not in the wrong place, an urban stroke of luck has happened. The all-new and planned "Central Station district", with housing and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another stroke of luck will happen: House 21 could receive a reinforcement from another construction by Krischanitz, since the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the temporary Berlin art room and, as you hear, negotiates with the city about a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans winter crisis package amounting to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would prevent train breakdowns in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against train breakdowns and delays caused by winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, of the investments planned until 2005 totaling around 300 million euros.
For this, a better availability of vehicles and the railway network must be achieved even with extreme weather.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees to 16,000 positions to remove snow from the tracks and platforms.
The goal is to clear the platforms of snow and ice for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, chairman of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train breakdowns and delays also this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in passenger transport, since, among other things, it lacked reservations due to adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for authorization from the federal railroad office.
In addition there is a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered a broken axle at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions in fines in the U.S.
After the tumult over President Josef Ackerman, a new problem of the USA appears, Deutsche Bank must pay there a millionaire fine.
As if the problems were not enough for Deutche Bank, its past in the US acquires the giant of the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in an agreement, to end the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five large credit unions during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial markets regulator NCUA reproaches many large banks for inducing credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; have minimized the risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and drag banks into the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court," a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York said.
The bank admits no fault with the deal.
This also applies to Citigroup, which obligated a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and provides bankruptcy support to protect clients' investments.
The NCUA is trying to repay the losses of millions incurred.
The agreements currently closed are its first type.
The regulator had also held other big banks accountable and in the summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the matter of doubtful mortgage securities, these are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing loans.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, it led to the downfall of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, a complicated wind is currently blowing for US banks.
Investors and the inspectorate have initiated countless prosecutions to receive compensation or sanction misdemeanours.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the most lawsuits.
He reproaches the 18 big international banks for the fact that the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank also has a demand from the FHFA, it is about businesses worth 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to be held accountable for "substantial losses," without naming an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes $10 billion to IBM
Finance guru Buffett invests heavily in IT company IBM.
Since March it has acquired shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer companies or Information Technology since the forecasts of the long-term development of companies are negative.
But he has read IBM's business report and changed his mind about investing in the sector.
He must have understood long before that IBM mainly offers services and procures computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, a Warren Buffett investment is regarded as an honor.
Therefore, the IT primitive should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett currently disclosed on economics broadcaster CNBC that he has acquired $10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway investment has thus risen to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM knew nothing of the commitment until now.
He praised the management that dealt with ordinary benefits in the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job," Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM established for some time lucrative IT services such as the operation of computer centers.
The 100-year-old IT pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful business equipment.
Buffett avoided tech companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose businesses he understood.
By contrast, Buffett seized the occasion on a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
His Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 subsidiaries of its own, as well as part of a whole series of large consortiums such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the '60s and, with wise investments, expanded it into one of the world's most valuable companies.
However, their lifestyle is humble.
That is why it is an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and unerring sense for making money has earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha."
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM's stock rose one percent.
"The Blue Giant," as IBM is known, has a stock market value of more than $220 billion and is among the world's most valuable technology companies along with Apple and Microsoft.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn't want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat materializes
Following the discovery of "the Zwickau cell", the Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
One newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is revived.
The murders of eight tricky and Greek small businessmen between 2001 and 2006 have a far-right background.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin, there has been a reaction with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost that was thought to have been dead long ago returns, since the attacks in the form of fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there had been no more episodes of violence with extreme right-wing undertones against Turks.
However, it has never been questioned that xenophobia exists in Germany.
The far-right network discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were by no means foreseeable.
"Is bloody ideology reigniting again?" headlines the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk."
The newspaper "Sabah" highlights on the contrary that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office of Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the far-right swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, remembering the victims of racist violence with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate over the weekend.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn act of the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged with cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information reached some Turkish media as a slap in the face: "The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary," reads the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the chain of murders.
The German broadcast "Hürriyet" also does not insist on tracing this mental connection.
"It starts to smell bad," reads the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He emphasizes that those killed were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
On the internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the behavior of the police and their subsequent success in searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are astonished that the German authorities have not searched much earlier for suspects in the far-right circle.
Some are at least rhetorical about the drastic means: "From now on here you lose, immigrants have nothing left but self-defense and weapons."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"Germany's internal peace depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network," writes "Selen."
Which means that, if Germany's internal peace is in danger, the attacks on Mölln and Solingen will become clear in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been engraved in German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks sharpen the group feeling on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press was then mainly criticized the deficiency of German policy after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the attack in the form of a fire in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the Turks in Germany contribute to taxes.
It becomes clear how a person's value is calculated based on the amount of their taxes.
The current information of the Turkish media once again shows how deep is, since then, the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a reappraisal of far-right terrorism in Germany, frank words are needed this time.
The bank of the Zurich Lake scandal
The riskiest bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now it is run by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought about it.
After his spectacular departure from the summit of the federal bank, in July it was known that in 2013 he would start a new and almost equally spectacular job: Chairman of the board of the great Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber rejoices publicly, praises Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and drops kind remarks about his future colleagues.
"USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I look forward to collaborating with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it became clear that everything would be totally different.
A USB financial operator in London bypassed all of the bank's security systems and defrauded €1.7 billion.
Oswald Grübel, CEO of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to attend.
The chairman of the USB board of directors has since considered himself equally touched, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was learned that Weber will have to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over as chairman of the board of directors in May, not in early 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, an economics professor and adviser and has had a period of adaptation surely necessary.
Suddenly, he becomes responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just proven again that it deserves the title "the largest scandal bank in Europe" for some time.
On the one hand, USB is huge, until recently it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it has slipped from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, saves the once proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid, but also crafty, Swiss asset manager was combined with ambitious goals, he also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, at $1.6 trillion, USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank in the league of the great banks of the world.
This is impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later banking professor in Zurich for many years explains: "To my students, I have always described USB as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong with the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was regarded as a brilliant and very intelligent banker, surprisingly resigned.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund embarked on losses with subprime securities and had to write down billions.
To carry this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, naturally that some looked on with contempt until shortly before: an Asian and opaque state fund in Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board of directors, in 2006 in the second highest paid board of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its misguided investments, UBS found itself in the financial crisis before bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic securities from UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, by which it became co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was affected, it was stated how dramatic this was for a small country, if it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the sum of UBS's balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times greater than Switzerland's economic performance (see graph).
"We can't bail UBS back," said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax conflict with America and was willing to hand over the data of wealthy clients, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of 780 billion dollars, reimbursement of unjustified profits of these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, UBS more or less confessed to having helped in the tax fraud.
At the same time, he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for wealthy clients: the halo of discretion.
After the scandal, the secrecy of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of customer funds.
In this way, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in investment banking through erroneous speculation and in the administration of assets through aid to tax fraud.
And just when it was a little calmer again, just when it was thought that UBS was getting it again, this unfortunate story of the operator happens, an individual trader defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it was revealed, apparently, this still does not work well with risk management in investment banking.
"The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute at the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also confident: "UBS's problem is that it does not master risk controls."
So the idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers have long presented themselves, to be the guardians of the greatest assets in the world: no risk too great, on the other hand, the security of money wants to break on the other side of the Alpine republic.
Swiss bank security deposits were the symbol of unwavering reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
UBS's Zurich headquarters doesn't fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it's just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on Zurich's Bahnhofstraße, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rents are some of the highest in Europe.
Here you will find jewelry stores such as Tiffany's among traditional Swiss businesses such as the Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have been home to this for years: from the national bank, through the Credit Suisse palace, to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
You enter the reception room of the UBS through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front are large leather armchairs, next to the logo of the bench there is a large sign to indicate "security".
UBS knows what the client is looking for here: Security.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point displaced the idea of the big Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the chairman of a small Swiss private bank puts it.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, also with the businesses of both big banks.
UBS has become too big, he believes, mainly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
There the Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And they have long become accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the jungle of high risk as the big Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"That Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("The UBS Crash" in English).
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do you come up with it?
You talk to the Swiss bankers, that's how they see the problem in the dimension of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges that, due to the merger, was too big for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to complement the two different precursor banks of UBS: a rich but dormant bank with the center of asset management in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a large financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to make his way from learning in the bank to the top."
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: The blunder came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Bring Goldman Sachs down from the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They topped the "League Tables," the rankings that then documented the success of banks.
UBS wanted to be at the top.
Some steps went well for him.
In forex trading and stock trading he was at the top.
However, the commissioned company advisors highlighted a weakness: In the business of international interest, in the language of "fixed income" banking, there is a huge compensation for large banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Eager for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of their hedge funds created in American high-risk investments.
It became a powerful machine to securitize American mortgage loans and then sell them, keeping certain risks on its own account.
And also, like other banks, it sought the descent for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the U.S. housing market was on fire, UBS bought there," said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order proved more complicated than they expected.
Positions at UBS became projectable seats and are insecure to this day.
Currently, who runs a large bank, has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, to which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea, to put an end to investment banking, concentrate on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking must decline a lot, it is now clear.
The following Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the bank's new president, will present his future strategy to the world.
In reality, only the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was thought of as a transitional solution, as the bank surprisingly split from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he prevailed: He must permanently run UBS's business, the Zurich bank said Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its status in the mid-nineties.
It abolishes 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is probably asking himself today.
So far he only says that he will first look for a house with his wife in Zurich.
The following year.
The fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US stock market
The looming recession in Europe has scared U.S. investors at the start of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remain without effect.
Slowed industrial production on the continent stifles hopes of stabilizing a debt crisis at source.
General relief over changes of government in Rome and Athens may not be imposed.
The euro fell against the dollar.
In the past week, the Italian and Greek glass has looked half full, not half empty, but now the problems are coming to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First and foremost, financial assets are on the sales list.
The Dow Jones index of standard stocks closed down 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.
In the session, the market barometer ranges between 12,027 and 12,170 points.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq index lost 0.8 percent and exited the market with 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax index said goodbye down 1.2 percent to 5,985 points.
The industry of the 17 euro countries has clearly reduced its production and is at the end of its boom.
Companies produced two percent less in September than the previous month, as reported by Eurostat's statistical office.
Which created skepticism among U.S. investors: "We are not an island, but dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be freed so quickly from a recession, plus there are more signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this caution, it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
That is why, in their view, it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, it jettisons a decade of old principles and enters the American tech sector.
Its investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supports the share price of the traditional consortium and makes it trade against the trend in the market at the beginning only a higher percentage.
The stock closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
After some indications, Buffett paid $170 on average for each unit and kept 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of American's equity shares clearly strengthened at 2.6 percent of the market.
The house sells almost all of its remaining holdings to China Construction Bank and pockets $6.6 billion.
The institute mainly wants to strengthen its capital share with the net profit of the business and thereby comply with regulatory requirements.
Planemaker Boeing increased profits, limiting losses at Dow.
The stock rose 1.5 percent after the consortium took the biggest order ever.

On the New York Stock Exchange approximately 710 billion shares changed ownership.
719 values increased, 2281 decreased and 79 remained unchanged.
The Nasdaq closed with selling volumes of $1.38 billion, 630 stocks higher, 1,913 lower and 82 unchanged.
Smart jackdaws spread in cities
In many places, rooks are considered "problem birds": these intelligent animals are not expelled from cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the rooks have belonged for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors accumulate for the filth and the noise of the animals.
Although no means against the "problem birds" have appeared so far.
The rooks no longer leave the cities, experts say at the first symposium on rooks in Leer, East Frisia.
There specialists from all over the national territory discuss possible solutions.
They look for alternatives in cities
Environmentalists attribute the problems of the cities to the migration of certain protected rooks from the countryside; Chemical applications in agriculture visibly destroy traditional living spaces.
Hunting, growing construction and the fall of trees that host them make life difficult for birds.
The rooks are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project to mass kill the rooks of the district jumped to the negative headlines of the press.
Critics have called the hunting of animals by bird traps and murder with sticks especially brutal.
"Expelling them and chasing them away in a normal way doesn't achieve anything," said Werner Klöver, urban planner and landscape architect at Leer.
Shooting nests with water or throwing trees are often unintended consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals are diverted, large colonies are divided and distributed elsewhere."
Driving them away is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We must live with them, we don't catch them anymore."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of scaring animals away from sensitive residential areas and baits is possible so that they resettle elsewhere.
"Information panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can hold a beak in the face with aplomb."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the Ascheberger jackdaw teaching circuit, where signs inform about the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on criticism of bird noise: "It's all forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the rooks not only take advantage of the resources to access schist morsels, but they make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists from the University of Cambridge checked in four rooks how far the intelligence of birds goes.
In one experiment, birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform in order to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they recognized with determination the size and shape that the stone had to have to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, the cunning jackdaws had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
Birds could not reach their prey with their beaks.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the bucket in the tube handle.
Three of the four jackdaws got it on the first attempt.

In the seventh minute and with a long-distance shot, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the post. Attacker Kazim Kazim was also unable to send the ball into the goal.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly took control.
After the break, Croatia didn't let them score any goals.
Along with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute. made room for Dortmund's Ivan Perisic, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the Bundesliga legionnaires in practice.

Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund's intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate Story of World War I, "begins with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make your soul fall at your feet.
Here are some acting tips: Gently rip this page off and make it your bookmark.
He will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund's novelistic narrative, and this dramatis personae will function as his GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which he aptly describes as "a work of anti-history."
It contains some notable names, important treatises or famous battles; There are virtually no ambassadors, fancy journalists, or discussions about tactics or material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as "a book about how it happened." It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods."
"The Beauty and Pain of Battle" combines the wartime experiences of about 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and clerks.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their limbs, go mad, or die.
Their lives flicker here like votive candles lit in a church; Some new ones are added to the mixture while others are turned off.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that World War I was only the disastrous trench warfare on the Western Front.
"The beauty and pain of battle" expertly moves through other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book have hives fall on them; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; Tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
War floods the lives of these people like a natural catastrophe, a Hurricane Katrina that reeks of cordite.
When artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or flee?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what is happening, or even why this war has to be fought.
"Lack of facts," Mr. Englund observes, "has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"The Beauty and Pain of Battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor in the High Seas Fleet.
Their stories have been obtained mostly from memoirs, letters, and other previously published material.
The explanations of their lives may be frightening or moving, but they are most vivid in Mr. Englund's accumulation of small moments, lost details.
Many of these are about deprivation and making do with what's out there.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl he says: "Substitutes, everywhere substitutes."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, faux rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He goes on to talk about substitute food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from rice cooked and pressed into mutton fat (and topped with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and peelings of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles."
There are, he notes, "837 permitted meat substitutes in sausage production, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse toward savagery and says about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are designed to do and not to sit in armchairs with a cigar and a whiskey, the evening newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that this varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that starched and studded breastplate."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will know or care.
"Once one resigns oneself to the thought of sacrificing, one would like to think that it could happen in front of the public," he writes.
Instead, it is horribly akin to "a condemned man being secretly strangled."
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new kinds of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the youth-century bestiary: The eloquent, ideologically convinced mass murderer in ready-made clothes who executes his carnage while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways; There is both ignoble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund speaks of soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way of evading service at the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen the gonococcal pus trade, which soldiers buy and smear with their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, which often results in lifelong blindness."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's agile but not extravagant prose is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes he reflects the way in which the war has "unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to ask why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as Paul Fussell's The Great War and Modern Memoir, or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's No Novelty on the Front, rather than comprehensive stories.
Mr. Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a work of nonfiction.
I won't reveal it.
But it is as if he had come from his book, torn that page of dramatis personae from between your fingers, and burned it with a match.
After a previous misstep, a planned assault to the minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be emptier.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others that they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was centered, underscoring how the operation was fraught with challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks, such as pepper spray spraying on protesters, violating department rules and creating a storm of public sympathy for the "squatters", could not be repeated.
And so the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had prepared themselves by seeing how the occupations had developed in other cities.
A major catastrophe drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye looking towards Zuccotti.
Officers ramped up so-called disorder training — counterterrorism measures that involved quickly mobilizing large numbers of police officers — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to enter the park came at the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as "an exercise."
"The few cops I know who were called for this, they weren't told it was to enter Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, officers wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from several police units, including special forces from across the municipal district — dozens of mobile agents who routinely flooded neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr Kelly said many people, such as those commuting to work, had been commuting to and from the park during the day, making 1am a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do it when there were the fewest people in the park," he said.
Emergency Services Unit trucks with spotlights and loudspeakers gathered at the intersection of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge before exiting.
Lights and pre-recorded messages rumbling from loudspeakers appeared to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs officers went to the park with their light blue windbreaks, many protesters just picked up their things and left.
No tents were touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering at the perimeter to enter if arrests needed to be made at the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the police department's chief spokesman, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said they tried to prevent them from seeing police go into action in the park, and that they had been dealt with sharply by officers.
Mr Browne said mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture footage.
As police moved west through the dense tangle of protesters' personal effects, including luggage and paper and plastic garbage bags crammed with clothes, crews from the Cleanup Department followed, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged outside, images appearing online a short time later.
A central group of protesters took up positions near the camp's kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police entered to methodically arrest them.
About 10 people at the camp's epicenter locked each other by the arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service officers were called in to cut the locks.
No arrests were made at the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearance operation was complete about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said some 142 people were arrested at the park.
Most of the arrests were for "disturbing public order and resisting authority," he said.
The highest-ranking agent on the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the head of the department, the top uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's chief of detectives, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, "was not directing operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block to the south.
From those positions, police were seen widening the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the northern perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen removing air from the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an officer and a protester were hospitalized.
Support workers union to sue city over layoffs
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, alleging the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon at the disposal of the union, from the 37th municipal district, in its effort to overturn the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the city's lowest-paid lost their jobs Oct. 7, in a move union leaders have described as political revenge for their refusal last spring to allow the city access to a health care fund run by task forces to close its gap. budgetary.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Hall hearing last month, Education Councilman Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were a part of the budget approved in June.
A Council member countered by telling him that nothing in the budget specified that the school's support staff members would be fired.
Officials from City District 37 said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that he would be sued. A press conference will be held Wednesday to announce the official filing of the lawsuit, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants, and has eight workers fired as plaintiffs, all of them black or Latina women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim of unfair treatment, saying poor schools lost more attendees because they had been chronically underfunded.
While there were no layoffs in Staten Island and a few layoffs at schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school attendees lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Considering the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget shortfall."
PS. District 36's budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each enrollment per poor student in schools.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by language in a memo authorizing the firing of parent coordinators.
The memo used the word "surplus" to describe the action, even though "surplus" most often describes the act of moving a teacher from a school payroll to a job board, whose salaries are paid by the head office.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired," the draft complaint says, "and not just in surplus."
Mission completed, Congress ready to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for veteran dictator Muammar Qaddafi to be captured and killed, and U.S. involvement came to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (D-Mass.), along with Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent from Connecticut), applauding Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their "bravery."
"This resolution is to honor the brave people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It's an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the Libya debate has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties were fighting each other and the White House over drafting a series of resolutions to approve or reject the U.S. military's role in NATO's mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and was never voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the chamber also rejected a measure that would have cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative purgatory — with Congress upset enough to criticize Obama's handling of the mission, but not so angry as to actually mow the grass under his feet.
Then the indecision of Congress was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee resolution "commends the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resilience to liberate themselves" and "commends the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide lawmakers as the June bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Sen. Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee's top Republican.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly all congressional Republicans and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually achieves an assembly-wide vote in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other lawmakers have so far been unsuccessful in getting their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of trying.
Goodlatte's is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicates — the same bill is proposed in both the House and Senate — and others with slight variations from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment in the House alone, and another handful that will "control federal spending."
Some of those bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors — especially novice Republicans looking to refine their resumes — a chance to boast that they were the "authors" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, which passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a nonbinding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms members of Congress can serve, while Rep. Jose E. Serrano (D-N.Y.) wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) has proposed a series of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one banning flag burning.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the overturning of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
As enthusiastic as members have been in proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to the 1990s, when members regularly tabled more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren't much more successful then than they are now.
The last amendment that was added - on the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was in fact proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Beaten but not defeated," Giffords speaks in first TV interview since shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot her at point-blank range at a constituent rally in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) appeared on national television Monday night, sang along to the Broadway tune "The Sun Will Rise Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In his appearance on ABC News' "20/20," with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The program documented his difficult path back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and that passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned by surprise to the House to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling deal.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — and described his recovery as "difficult."
When asked by Sawyer how he feels, Giffords, 41, replied, "Pretty good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long "20/20" special program that aired on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special looked at Giffords' recovery since the Jan. 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, her head shaved and a long scar running across her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers upright, while her husband encourages her.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
A nod.
A pursed of the lips.
And then, his first word: "What."
Within days, Giffords uttered another word — "toast," a request for change to his breakfast menu.
Videos released by ABC show music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing along with therapists the songs "Girls Just want to Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who does two hours of therapy every day, said he doesn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
"A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point in his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
"You've just been beaten.
And you're going to get out of this, and you're going to recover and you're going to come back stronger than ever."
Troops make you feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
At that moment, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines stormed their posts around him.
The etiquette crowd stood up and applauded.
"The men and women were regarded as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A senior military officer at the gala, also known as then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
"They were shown as some sort of orphaned child," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really. It was pity.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has gripped the military and an often distant, sometimes adoring American public.
He lavishes the troops with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, service members say.
The public increasingly acts as if they feel sorry for those in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brig. Gen. Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put us in the role of helpless souls."
The issue is a very sensitive topic for military leaders, who don't want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by returning troops in the final years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about pity are held quietly and privately among war veterans.
After his two sons returned from Marine Corps, retired Col. Mark Cancian warned them that people other than the military would view their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of dread because they confronted the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be an "angry, violent veteran below the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt like some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to hang on under the pressure of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions," Cancian recalled telling her children.
Military unease arises, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in World War II," said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, praise from politicians and the public focuses heavily on the depth of a service member's suffering.
Troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
Military faces mounting pressure to end rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for their alleged passivity in the face of rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a comrade.
It was October 2008, and he was on his way back to his barracks at Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"A red flag sounded," Lyman says.
However, the Texas native put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached her from behind, knocking her down and raping her, she alleges.
This week, Nov. 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel eagerly await a court decision in a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether their lawsuit against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce widespread rape among the military, in violation of soldiers' constitutional rights.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C., attorney, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the military failed to investigate, prosecute, or deliver adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going for the Army staff, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a top-down structure," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The high command."
Burke also says that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 more survivors, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, you will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Defense Department, led by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy — in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not liable for damages suffered by active-duty personnel.
"The alleged damages are part of the plaintiffs' military service," the documents say.
The Defense Department declined to comment for this article.
Things have changed since the 50s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars are rarely clear on the front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in reaching out to local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 female soldiers have died and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It's time for the military to modernize, too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her fight, and three other lawsuits are underway in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
Meanwhile, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a lawsuit against the military that focuses on "personality disorder" diagnoses assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them from service — a common occurrence, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network.  a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles benefit claims for people who say they were sexually assaulted on duty.
Nine separate bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a number of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Defense Department's Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
However, the assaults are notably underreported, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, it figures at approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, released in March, also examines prosecution rates: In 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military went to trial — half that of the civilian justice system.
Plaintiffs in Burke's case describe his attacks as just the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, he reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell the details of her rape 11 separate times to a crowd of police, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and her assailant's blood — from a cut on her arm — was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which she was asked about having sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons testified as witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to go to work – I found myself screaming from the living room."
"They put me in the psychiatry unit, and when I came out, I remember telling my command officer, 'That wasn't your judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010 she was discharged from service on less-than-honorable terms, which prevents her from receiving any benefits.
As for whether the case brought by Lyman and his fellow lawsuits continues, it's a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it doesn't have the same incentive and deterrence that liability poses.
He adds: "The odds are strongly against them... But it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't go their way, Burke, the plaintiffs' attorney, will put his hundreds of other plaintiffs in the queue for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until reform occurs," he says.
"Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another guy airing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to carrying out a massacre in Norway in July that left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time preceding his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just log in to Facebook.
"We realized it wasn't that hard to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British think tank DEMOS.
Facebook's stash of personal information is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographics with scientific accuracy — the way marketers have been using for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then targeted ads to them, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes toward violence and optimism about their own future.
Arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries — all without leaving the office.
"It's a totally new way of doing research," Bartlett says.
Some of the results aren't entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male, and angry about immigration.
However, in a kind of twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen."
DEMOS' work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in likes, wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating a research boom, driving the number of scholarly papers with the site's name in the title up to nearly 800% in the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn't approach with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you were trying to survey people in the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to go through the game, and they'd never allow you access," Bartlett says.
"Facebook removes all of that – you go to them directly."
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address social-health issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and colleagues found that college students who talked about their drunken exploits on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student post too many status updates with their binges.
"You can't treat a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle's Children's Research Institute, the Washington Post said.
"We have found a way to identify at-risk children who would otherwise go undiagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "poking" its own population for data.
The site's Data Team has produced statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of voter turnout midway through the 2010 legislative term, and a National Happiness index (mainly using the information that can be accessed – digital freedom advocates have long argued that the site should make its vast amount of data available to others for the research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – the sacrifice of being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know about?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is an open bar for everyone.
"I don't think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the Knowledge Lab in London, of a 2006 study he conducted with students' public Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it's impossible to know that some of the information in a user's profile and wall messages are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
That's why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a paper clip and pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There's no substitute for going into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about the social – and a lot of social research still happens offline."
"Cold and inhumane: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to masterminding the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance at the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Knights Templar of Norway," he told a packed room of 500 people.
"I oppose the court because it received the mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the facts but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because he "didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views."
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, barred him from media access for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is being held under lock and key.
Everyone attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhumane," one Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was awkward, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked reporters and survivors in the eye as he entered and exited the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion of being part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge determined he is not mentally ill, and said there is no evidence he acted with accomplices.
Some may be comforted that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that doesn't automatically soften the pain and confusion an entire nation still feels.
"I'd like it to look like a monster, but it doesn't look like it," said a relative of one victim.
"It would be much easier if it looked like it."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' Lost Interview Shown in Theater This Week
Following Steve Jobs' death on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford – distinguishing the tech genius as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing, in a newly rediscovered Jobs interview that has been dusted off in a preview of a series of special screenings in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about business processes and product workflows.
He was certainly a self-recognized designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a junkie of flowcharts – a man who believed many executives suffered "a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [But] there's an enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds about the dawn of the personal computer, and sat down for more than an hour with Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At the time, barely 10 years had passed since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensely at his new computer company NeXT, hoping for popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringely interview was used in Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during his transportation.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This archival material, slightly reissued, is the basis of Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, 68 minutes, which arrives in Landmark theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
To someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to lay out his tech philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers — 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also times when Jobs' perfectionism surfaces, where he seems impatient because of Cringely's questions, pushing him to go faster toward the most important issues or arguments.
Filmed before the Pixar era, the iPod or the iPhone, there's something strangely prescient about The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
It's one thing to read posthumous evaluations of Jobs' career, but there's something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here, the anxious dreamer on the brink of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, he went and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences from The Lost Interview:
On how he learned to run a business:
"Over the years in the business, I always asked, 'Why do you do things?' and the answers you are invariably given are, 'Oh, that's just the way it's done.'
No one knows why he does what he does, in business nobody thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs takes into detail his efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Baffled by the way costs were recorded – often starting with a "standard cost" that was done with a good eye, and then adjusted with a "variable" – he developed an automated factory that ensured they could determine business costs in detail.
On the joke to the Pope:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak – a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make free long-distance calls.
Extensively has been written about the device, but Jobs' euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a payphone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were wrapping things around the world a half-dozen times and you were screaming through the pay phone and coming back a minute later to the pay phone next door," Jobs says with a chuckle.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
The two of us, we didn't know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing – it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs goes on to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak to the pope, while doing his best Henry Kissinger impersonation.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two burst into laughter just before the pope himself was awakened to answer the phone.
On falling in love with technology (and selling over the phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs landed a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a noticeable influence on me, it was the only company I had ever seen at that age and it shaped my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a little cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I would get a ride to HP as a teenager and waste time with that machine and write programs for it.
On improvising innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly.
Early in his career, as he set about selling a handful of motherboards, he was asked by a customer if he could assemble the entire equipment.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to figure out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments... They were yelling at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got fed up and went outside and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
On large companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple's renaissance, Jobs prophetically foresaw how many industry leaders would stumble on his vision, and lose control of their market share.
"Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers and printers, so what?"
You have a monopoly on market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is these kinds of people who end up running companies and the people in charge of the products are expelled from the forum for decision making.
The product genius that led to that monopoly position rots because of people who don't have the notion of good products vs. bad products – the knowledge of the necessary craft.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took defeat from victory.
On innovation as artistic expression:
"There's a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... As the big idea evolves, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make – some things you can't make electrons do, glass does, robots make them, factories do.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end it all comes down to taste – it comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best that a team of humans has ever done, and then trying to adapt those things to what you're doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed about stealing great ideas.
What partly made the Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren't for computer science, I might be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dine with health care law rivals as court accepts case
On the day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to examine the politically contentious question of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama's health care law, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were feted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will present the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to thoroughly study the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging total health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists across the country.
The justices agreed to admit the lawsuit and, in fact, a historic 5 1/2 hour argument is expected in March, and the result will likely further muddy the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear in court and argue that the law should be scrapped will likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. attorney general during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a longtime group dedicated to upholding conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that defied the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel, hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of the health care law.
The special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It's nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it's not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of lower federal magistrates.
If they weren't, they could be said to fall under Canon Code 4C, which says, "A judge may attend fundraisers of law-related and other organizations, although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or feature on the program of such an event."
However, Scalia and Thomas' absolute proximity to two of the law firms in the case, as well as a firm with enormous financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in government.
"This stunning ethical gap and disregard for the code runs counter to the demands of several justices that the court abides by the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, the president of Common Cause.
"The judges were feted at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."
Their appearance and assistance at fundraising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in critics who say they too easily mix the court's activity with the agenda pushed by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is Justice Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan served as attorney general for the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were filed in trial court.
Her critics have pressed for Kagan to refrain from hearing the case, saying she was too involved in upholding the law to now be impartial.
Kagan has given no indication that he will do so.
Boeing receives record $18 billion order
Emirates is ordering 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle aircraft, with an option for 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a deal valued at more than a billion dollars.
It rarely makes the news when a company gets an order for 50 units of its product.
But it's a big deal when the company is planemaker Boeing Co. and the asking price for the 50 planes amounts to a record $18 billion.
It's as big as the place where Boeing received the order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 planes worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest-ever order for commercial airplanes worth in dollars — 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle jets.
The successful order came from Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes, bringing the total selling price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts spectacular fuel economy and passenger services.
The sale price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing," said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
"The quality of these particular customers is very strong."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
So, not only do they have the money to pay for planes, but an increase in fuel prices – usually harmful to airlines, because it's one of the biggest costs – isn't that damaging, because the country is making money from rising oil prices.
That's important because they're less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural protection," he said.
The Emirates' order solidifies Boeing's leadership in the widebody market and helps keep rival Airbus SAS's attempt to encroach on its dominance with the A350 passenger jet at bay.
Boeing's victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it would delay the debut of the larger A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5 percent to $67.94.
Mexico's President's Sister Apparently Defeated in Michoacan Vote
Luisa Maria Calderon says drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the race for governor.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost her candidacy for governor of Michoacan during the violent state's election, and she claimed Monday that drug traffickers helped tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents.
Preliminary results gave Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, the lead in the Western state race for governor.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," Luisa María Calderón said in a radio interview a day after Sunday's vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our poll workers... They took over the ballot boxes, set up barricades... and ordered people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a comeback, and victory in Michoacan is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have narrowly edged out Calderon, who had led the polls before the election.
Calderon, a candidate from his brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the governor's office, came in third, a major defeat for the divided and unfortunate left ahead of the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also declined to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital of Morelia state, denied ties to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacan to launch a targeted military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was assassinated a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates abandoned local candidacies out of fear.
But for the PRI, as unpleasant as Michoacan's elections may seem, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo, saying, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, looking ahead to next year."
ADB urges Asia to help rescue eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would impede growth in Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world's two fastest-growing economies had to "do everything possible" to accelerate the economic bloc's recovery either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries watching Europe's difficulties in an "even-handed" manner and said financial assistance from Asia along with European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is helpful," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune."
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means."
Europe's monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
Europe's ongoing sovereign debt crisis has raised fears it could push the global economy into recession and prompted calls for major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said bilateral assistance – such as buying the bonds of the EU's rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility – offered greater bargaining power for Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India's commerce minister, said "India is going to do everything it can" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from falling exports and drying up foreign capital inflows.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help wealthy Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for India's one billion two hundred thousand people, of whom up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will realize that Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that will not go down well," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep Greece's many well-paid public sector workers in jobs at poorly managed, loss-making companies like railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens "major knock-on effects" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank's forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces "downside risks" due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious warnings from the Pentagon about possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta heated up Congress on Monday, warning that looming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and set off a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in reductions over the next decade, but now fears a further reduction of $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department," Panetta said in a letter to Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey Graham, R-Calif.
He said Congress' failure to agree on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "sequester," would result in 23 percent global reductions and a halt to many new projects.
"Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate manner, would render most of our naval and construction projects unworkable — three-quarters of a ship or a building cannot be purchased — and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to remove many of our civilian staff involuntarily and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would almost certainly have to discharge civilians in order to meet the target."
"These changes would break faith with those who maintain our military and seriously damage goodwill."
The cuts would eventually catch up with combat troops, Panetta said.
"While wartime funding in the Overseas Contingency Operations accounts is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be adversely affected by severe disruptions to base budgets," Panetta warned.
"Hiring of staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervision of the war-supporting contract."
"Payroll staff would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to suppliers in wartime, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of the automatic cuts on the Defense Department.
"The consequence of a hijacking of the Department of Defense would lead to a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We stand firmly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they released Panetta's letter.
"This is not an outcome you can live with, and it's certainly not one we should impose on ourselves."
"Kidnapping is a threat to U.S. national security interests, and it must not be allowed to happen."
Whether Panetta's letter and recent warnings from senators will increase pressure for a budget compromise or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about potential cuts, even though he arrived at a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budget experience in Congress and the White House and knowing he faced tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense secretary painted a grim picture of what might lie ahead — an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to accomplish the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is not able to keep up with potential adversaries."
"Indeed, it invites aggression..."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta sets out new details of how reductions "create significant operational risks: delayed response time to crises, conflicts, and disasters; severely limits our ability to be previously deployed and engaged around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could tackle the axe, including those already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
That list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter jet, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new littoral combat ship and the new land-based combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Halting development and further testing of the F35 could generate some $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but supporters say it's the vital next step in improving and tackling potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and pervasive deception and lying are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy trading sexual harassment allegations with several women; Each side accuses the other of lying.
Administrators at Pennsylvania State University have been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was "caught" with an open microphone claiming to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself with his denials quickly refuted by irrefutable proof.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations related to covering up an extramarital affair.
And, again, no one who lived it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about cheating in school and university exams are widespread.
There have been cases in which teachers have given the answers of the exams to the students in order to be better seen in their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
On any given day, studies show that you can be lied to anywhere 10 to 200 times.
That's for sure, many of those lies are white lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Detecting lies, or "locating lies," is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, for example, Charade, where the goal is to exclaim: "I have you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities that carried out in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars do look into each other's eyes.
They don't always stutter, babble, blush, or fidget.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can get to the truth by learning about statement structure, microfacial expressions, question formation, and timing.
I spent several years probing scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that deception detection is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, or managing negotiations.
Good liars have the ability to read others well, making them feel at ease, managing their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more "self-oriented lies," while women tell more "other-oriented" lies -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less frequently to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they usually tell tend to be "huge").
We also know that if you are perceived as an evildoer, others will feel less guilty for lying to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the subject's habitual behavior.
This is called "creating a baseline."
It helps provide benchmarks to measure changes later.
Observe the subject's posture, laughter and vocal characteristic.
You better know if someone normally taps your foot all the time so you don't make unfair accusations when you see your feet tapping in the middle of the meeting.
Next, look for groups of deceptive behavior, verbal and nonverbal.
Consider these behavioral groups as red flags, not proof of deception.
Cheaters may freeze their upper body as they try to remember their story, point their feet toward the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or exhibit a "post-interview vent" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all the hard questions are over.
Interrogators often falsely make it appear that the interview is over just to seek that post-interview relief.
Also pay attention to the vocabulary of the subject.
Scott Peterson screwed up to the bottom and used the past tense while claiming his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide search for her.
People who cheat can also use distancing language: "I didn't have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone may use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... as far as I know... to my knowledge."
This makes the response a perception rather than a fact and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to uncover deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone's chances of avoiding being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan diverted after the threat of US delay in its approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- infuriating unions while appeasing environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project back on track.
TransCanada said late Monday it will move the planned pipeline out of Nebraska's ecologically sensitive Sandhills area, and is confident the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at a news conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada CEO Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that eventually the pipeline will be approved, albeit with a different route.
This follows the State Department's announcement last week that they would delay the decision for a federal permit for the project until potential new routes are studied to bypass the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground water supply.
"This is a real path forward," Rep. Lee Terry, R-Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may set aside any decision until 2013, after next year's election, though officials denied that politics was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department's request, and expressed his full support for them.
The 1,700-kilometer pipeline would stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would bring 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by task forces, which have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala Aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's current environmental impact study found that the project posed only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department's inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether TransCanada's hired lobbyist, Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign adviser in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to run the original studio was an inappropriate choice because it was tied to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle Sued for Allegedly Causing Child to Vomit in Fear
A New York family claims disco diva Patti LaBelle behaved like a madwoman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, terrifying her young daughter to the point that she vomited in fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tirade scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much so that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "increased her fear of strangers," her family says in Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when stagehand Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were getting ready to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was taking the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stood near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone came up from behind and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes' and went to get her," he said.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't have left your daughter near the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
"I said, 'I have no interest in what you say or think.'
He became enraged and started using bad words - the word C and the word J out loud...
He had a bottle of water and started throwing the water from the bottle on me."
He said Genevieve became hysterical.
"I told this woman, 'Look what you've done to my daughter,'" the girl's mother said.
LaBelle pounced on the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be restrained by her surroundings and retreated to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so hard that she vomited, he added.
The family later sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but got no response.
The attorney and representatives for LaBelle did not return calls for comment.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money it can to a support association for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct," Davis said.
"Such behaviour is completely unacceptable, especially when targeting an 18-month-old kindergarten teacher in her arms."
Climate adversity slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez's administration, unemployment and informality have increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment has fallen and the economy contracted.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, self-styled change, which generated great expectations regarding the advances in the economy, but given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, no growth is observed, instead there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millionaire losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of effects by frost, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damages in 582 thousand 835 cultivated hectares, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent had partial damage, the main crops damaged were those of vegetables, corn and chickpeas.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated growth, since while from January to March 55 thousand 053 Sinaloans were unemployed,  with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Economically Active Population, for the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 percent, a rate that in number of people throws more than 74 thousand unemployed Sinaloans, an increase over the first semester of 18 thousand 969 individuals.
Reduced liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out from public policy.
"What we are seeing is a growth in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the effects of a resource constraint due to the legislation that was approved in Congress to combat money laundering, and for people who grab dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work them.  invest them and use them in something," he said.
Stopped migration
López Cervantes pointed out that in the increase in unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties to enter, and second because entering they also have many difficulties to find work, those people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which causes unemployment to rise."  Said.
Informality
The analysis of the Sinaloan labor market is aggravated when considering the high level of informality that predominates among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population in the state works without being contributing as a worker before any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state's labor lags are low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7,375 pesos.
FDI contraction
In addition to the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 there is the largest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Economy from January to June of state FDI totaled 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a fall of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars registered during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Secretariat of Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17 thousand 280 million pesos in the year, occurred mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the state government requested in July to the state congress the approval of a credit for 3 billion pesos, which would be destined to investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to reactivate the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2 thousand 600 million pesos,  And until November they have not observed the benefits of borrowing in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of Mario López Valdés' government shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of wills of the different sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we must work intensely to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, we failed to align the effort of all and especially the good progress already synchronized of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better, "  Expressed.
Economic slowness
Loredo Lopez said events like the frosts at the beginning of the year halted the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frost, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations we had, "  Mentioned.
Redefining vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers' Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, he said that it is necessary to direct the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that we have been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated," he said.
Work to be done
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that better channels the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the government has been striving to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there is some progress but it is important that a long-term program is developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its conduct of public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is being more inclusive, what I can say is that there is work done and I think the Government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
He is convicted of 8 kgs of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a 100-day fine for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General's Office reported that the drug dealer sentenced is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime of against health, in its variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of post 80, in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving in a white pick-up truck, where he carried a black bag in the box of the vehicle and in the passenger seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured was placed at the disposal of the Second District Judge and the sentenced person continues to be held at the Center for the Execution of the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
Must contribute for works
The social works contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or of having serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although so far the work programs have advanced, they are at risk because the State Government has not complied with the contributions that correspond to it, which add up to a resource of more than 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He pointed out that in total the investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State corresponds to 25 percent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have contributed resources for the works, so the possible delay in the conclusion of these becomes effective.
"There are almost 12 million that they have to contribute and although the year is about to end they have not given us a fifth, when since July they should have given us a part," he said, "we have started the works in order not to delay us and they are very advanced, but we need the money. "
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to request a loan to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not contribute on that occasion.
"It already happened to us in the previous six-year term because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued walking, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the State left pending," he explained.
Although there is a commitment from the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to hasten the efforts so that the percentages that correspond to them arrive as soon as possible.
"There are almost 12 million that they have to contribute and although the year is about to end they have not given us even a fifth."
Cut validates "analog blackout" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that the world has undergone in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies filed by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog blackout" from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes necessary to invalidate it did not meet.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when issuing the decree that details the actions to be taken to complete the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft ruling, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero herself voted in favor of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree, and by admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it arranged for the digital transition.
The plenary session of ministers also decided to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the minister president said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to prepare.
"Nor do I consider that doing so would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the federal executive, who has by constitutional mandate, the rectory of the State.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has undergone in recent years, and translates into a better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing change, he argued, would be postponing the benefits of digitalization, which implies a decision of public interest, which does not have only a technical dimension, "since it covers economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic stewardship of the State, encompassing a group of attributions that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and have done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the impugned decree, invades in any way the sphere of competence of Congress, since it is providing in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws issued by the Legislature, he said.
Possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán analyzed
According to the data released by the PREP the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,074 total records.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where according to data provided by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial election is only 27 percent.  The votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,074 total records have not yet been counted.
In this regard, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just last November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local regulations with the federal reform in electoral matters.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Law of Electoral Justice, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal deadline so that they could enter into force in the present electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted their publication within the deadlines provided for in the Law of the Official State Newspaper.  on the grounds that he had some objections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Branch and described as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state president to the constitutional reforms, since he does not have the right to "sanction or veto them."
Interviewed about the possibility of "voting by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial recount of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may occur in the event that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of scrutiny and computation in the file of the box or it is not in the possession of the president of the same; or, when there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the votes received in all the polling stations of the election may be carried out when there is an indication that the difference between the presumed winning candidate of the election in question and the candidate who has obtained the second place in the ballot is equal to or less than one percentage point; as long as at the beginning of the session there is the express request of the representative of the party and / or coalition that nominated the second of the candidates indicated.
The total count of the vote may also be carried out if, at the end of the ordinary count, it is established that the difference between the presumed winning candidate and the one placed second is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate came in second.  case in which the electoral packages that have been subject to partial recount will be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that in this situation is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total records.

Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented to the media eleven people who were arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and with the coup de grace, in an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country on the brink of economic disaster.
Italy's prime minister-designate Mario Monti will meet Italy's president on Wednesday to unveil the new government that will face a crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic disaster and endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano to confirm he can form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the outcome of his talks with political parties in his bid to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he would be able to form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "framework is now well drawn," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, far less than normal, as Italy battles a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a harsh austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain battered confidence in Italy.
Underscoring pressure on Monti to hurry, market instability pushed the yield on Italian 10-year BTP bonds above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to bail out.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of Italian employers' association Confindustria, told reporters after meeting Monti: "We said we would be very supportive of this government."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were boosted considerably by the backing of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support for the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because until now many of its members have opposed the technocrat-majority government Monti is forming.
Parliamentary support
Monti's new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in their efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
Italy's association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a Monti failure would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as youth and women's organisations, on Monday.
It will end its round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite late last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would step down, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty over whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescuing Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the eurozone's current financial defenses.
Monti has said his government should last until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before bringing forward the elections.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist it should be made up only of technicians, an indication of their qualms about a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources said mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The friction of the Spaniards is superior to that of the Ticos
Of the 22 players called up from Spain, ten exceed 50 international games.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 summoned reached 50 matches.
A major contrast to Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 summoned by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the world and European champions, number one in FIFA's monthly ranking, have a wide record of class A interselections games, the Tricolor only has defender Michael Umaña as the only one who has all 50 international matches.
This figure was reached the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), at the Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs in the Premier League of England, maintain an intense activity a year in league and domestic cup championships, and high-level clashes in European cups such as Champions League.
To this is added the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated qualifiers of the European Championship and the World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the other hand, have limited international contact in an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish National Team is the goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who the previous Saturday against England (0-1 loss in London) equaled the record of goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and impose a new record for Spain of 127 international caps.
Xavi Hernandez, Barcelona's midfielder, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by UEFA along with the other centenarians of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the battering ram of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Almost close to the centennial figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fabregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and close to Michael Umaña, are the left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five surpassed 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is nowhere near 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet debuted.
Spain's all-time top scorer is David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who registers the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country in its tour celebrating two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament, of Pearl Jam, said that the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday, at the National Stadium.
It has been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band assures that for them it will also be to make the dream of playing in the country come true.
This was stated by bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is in the South American wing of its tour celebrating two decades of work and on Sunday 20 will make its only stop in Central America.
That day they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with the Los Angeles band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which is in La Nación on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican fans, it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is only our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I have been to Costa Rica only once and on vacation; It's such a beautiful country and I think we're going to be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to take our music there.
I ask him because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity the days before.
What do they say to their most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying by our side through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to his concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the last 21 years happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and hopefully that got us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends always went surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; That's how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Watching the tour, they have been delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, then we don't have any restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; We will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why is this?
I think it's partially because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we may have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and so I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of experience.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they've accomplished?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don't think any of us imagined we'd be in a great rock band and having done it for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love to create music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world that we always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean to you to have been a fundamental part of the rise of grunge?
It's always been an honor to be a part of that group of great bands.
We are good friends with the folks at Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is something uncommon.
Every once in a while, a band emerges from a city, but it's much stranger when five or ten bands leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're fortunate to be friends with all of them still and we're honored to be a part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It's also very strange that a band like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, on its own, is much longer than many bands last.
Firstly, I think we are all fortunate to still be alive and, secondly, we all care about each other.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also opened that give each one freedom to experiment.
We trust each other with each other's music and it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been easy; However, thanks to their success, they have been able to do whatever they want.
How do they find a balance?
As we have grown, it has become easier to find a balance.
We make sure you're not too touring because it's easy to fall into that game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for the music, that reminds you to respect the music and what brought it, without being infatuated with being famous and being a rock star, something none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote really good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and never released a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were a lot of frustrations because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still very close friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think about the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work,  laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was an amazing human being and we miss him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that comes to mind.
As a bass player, what are your influences?
There are so many.
Among the first ones that come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bass players I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep grunge relevant despite no longer being a fad?
I think all of us always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the bands that came out at the same time, and, if there's relevance now, I think it's a wonderful thing because it's music worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
Why this change?
It's interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that maybe seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed touched them, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs definitely represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his 1990-2000 administration, suffers from several ailments, including tongue cancer for which he has undergone surgery four times and which is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Canal N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said that he does not want it because he knows he is innocent.
He was operated four times for cancer of the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilos to which other pathologies have been added such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreas cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been imprisoned since September 2007 in the police's National Directorate of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment for the deaths of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his rule.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and made up of several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderon, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political and commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans residing in Mexico, according to the agenda released by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "conducive to the exchange of information on all political issues between the two nations," according to the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultation to its ambassador in the European country.
Since November, Mexico has chaired the G20, a group made up of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world, and has an agreement in force with the South American country since January of this year to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to expedite the realization of tax exchange agreements in order to get out of the "gray list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), formed by countries that did not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004 that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustachioed plumber goes through three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never before had he done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month in stores around the world, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable system, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the use of glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," said the head of specialized press of Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for that support", since until now successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman has maintained that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Alvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to give a "second round" to the game levels, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also means the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo winks at the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of success of the previous deliveries, consisting of the plumber with the mustache will have to travel platforms mined with dangers in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom endorses Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he processed the extradition of former president Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the conspiracy to launder US $ 70 million.
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to judge him there.
In a press conference, Colom said that his decision is due to the independence of the judiciary and executive, taking into account that a sentencing court had already ordered the extradition.
He asserted that during his mandate "he did not put his hands" in judicial resolutions and processed all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquin, for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking, will be extradited.
What Colom did is an executive procedure after all judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to prosecute the former president between 2000 and 2004.
According to resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for the embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process that preceded the extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 at-risk youth
The entity was born to avoid the fall into the marginality of children without training
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter of a century.
To this is added the hundred long jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock of an event held in the old Fabra i Coats factory complex attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of dograddiction or in a situation of falling into marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of heads of entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the middle of electoral time, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Along with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the event was attended by the former socialist Minister of Education, Ernest Maragall, and the former deputy mayor and current ecosocialist councilor Ricard Gomà.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the great hall of Fabra i Coats.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is also difficult, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis."
The president gave Trinijove as an example for knowing how to fight against bad circumstances and for giving hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Evicted a squatted farm where macro parties were held
The invaders had taken over 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm at noon yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare lived by the neighbors of 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left yesterday noon voluntarily the building they occupied illegally, and where they organized macro parties that despaired the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was over, the deadbolt on the door was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on there will be access control," said the administrator.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building -the rest are inhabited-, took all the electrical installation and part of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the massive parties, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building there is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has dropped by 80%.
The owner of the nightclub points out that the invaders of the farm made unfair competition, since they sold the drinks at three euros, while in the disco they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment venue had had to respond to neighborhood complaints about noise, while, as she pointed out, the inconvenience is not caused by the customers of the disco, but by the inhabitants of the squatted house and, above all, the attendees of the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks.  according to angry neighbors in the area.
The head of the nightclub explained that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago she "forgave" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana also confirmed that during the last weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the city council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "to immediately evict the property to end the problems of coexistence and civility that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area."
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the last few months the squatters had been entering all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some there have even been robberies.
In this sense, he added that, "it is necessary to end impunity and be forceful against the incivility that has been generated on the farm."
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. the police went to 35 rue de Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbour who had observed that four people were entering the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree on the timing of the call beyond controversies over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, at the height of the now extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some promotional posters of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with New York's Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park returned to the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented in the north-south axis but above (mountain) -down (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park results in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of Yogi Bear.
In these were until, in September, the city council convened a mega-competition composed of 16 competitions for as many access doors to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of park, without a doubt.
Either that or someone intends to put doors to the field.
The question comes alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it means of reflection on the city, is the topic of conversation among all Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurring theme to fall back on when two members of this ancient caste of chosen ones recognize each other in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it is necessary" to discuss "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It is worth starting from the basis that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", says the architect for whom the title of "Collserola gates" contains a "lexical trap": we must not think of them "as the accesses to a park, but the delimitation of areas where you have to act".
Mòdol, like Roldán and Bayonne with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from how "uncertain it is today to project public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and that had in the area of the Forum "its swan song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on where it can be built.
"To limit something is to fix the next step", that is, its overpassing.
"We have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM) ] can give rise to real disasters."
Closer to the question, Mòdol believes that, simplifying, the Vallès slope of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, not", for a purely topographical matter.
Mòdol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "should not fall on deaf ears", although he appreciates the opportunity that the city council offers his guild to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe-conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubts" whether it is this technical profile that should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("a success", he says) that have had to be created: "Architects should be just a tool".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because in the bases of the contest there is a lack of a global vision of Collserola: "16 transversal competitions have been called," he says, "in the mountain-sea direction, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole."
This means, at least where appropriate, that it has chosen to participate in all 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors may clash in program and definition with that of the architect next door.
In his opinion, yes, the city council should guarantee that the strip immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of facilities that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and will go free
After 72 days of arraigo, the legal representative of the Casino Red granted the pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that was followed for alleged blackmail
After spending 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal representative of the Casino Red granted him a pardon before the Second Criminal District Court, which continues a process for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded the payment of an economic fee so that the Monterrey City Council would allow the clandestine operation of the bookmaker.
Following the public complaint, the State Attorney General's Office opened criminal proceedings against the brother of the PAN mayor and on September 2 he was detained and detained for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agent of the Public Ministry 3 in Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when a second arraigo order was issued after the Public Prosecutor dismissed the crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta prison for allegedly blackmailing the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos; However, he only spent a few hours in the medium-security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, an arrest warrant was issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigations, sufficient evidence was verified to determine Jonás' guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the bookmaker in exchange for allowing its operation.
This Monday, the legal representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went before the judge José Luis Pecina to request forgiveness for the brother of the royal mayor; so in the next few hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the agent of the Public Ministry assigned to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and which of the partners of the bookmaker was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
Based on file 197/2011, the legal pardon is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and henceforth no claim can be filed regarding the process that was followed; In addition, no reparation of damage or punishment will be required.
After the hearing with the legal representative of the bookmaker, around 3:50 p.m. the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The secretary of the Court, Jorge Yánez, went to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonás that he has been legally pardoned and his file will be archived.
He will also notify you of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash where Interior Secretary Francisco Blake and seven others lost their lives
The Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT) reported that the results of the accident where Interior Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people lost their lives indicate that the helicopter was directly impacted on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flying.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with trees 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport personnel.
In addition, he said that in the investigations carried out in the impact zone, the appearance of pieces on the ground is not reported.
"In a search it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was structurally.
"The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to transport passengers.
The terrain has a slope of seven degrees at 30 degrees of inclination.
For the moment, the secretary assured that it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible; However, the research can last several months, it could even reach a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, general director of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff was operating at cruising speed and that this happened on a soft ascending ground.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical regulations the flight was carried out under the rules of visual flight, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the terrain.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM located adequate conditions for takeoff, as the aircraft advances towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico there were layers of cloudiness at low altitude.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to cloudy conditions the crew has sought an area of lower elevation and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of the impact.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a small area:
The information available so far allows us to assume that the impact occurred in a straight and sideways trajectory.
The pattern of dispersion of aircraft debris suggests that the helicopter was impacted on the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the crash, evidence remains undisclosed in the wreckage of any kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the field.
During the field work, pieces of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above mean sea level, the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predictably disarticulated along this route.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After a thorough search over an area wider than the cordoned-off site around the crash, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, reinforcing the presumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Social Security conducts research to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people; is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people, called the protocol 'Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence', which will allow markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Specialty Hospital of the National Medical Center Siglo XXI, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the research, the population, whether or not they are entitled to participate, is invited to attend the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out on minors, every Saturday from 8:00 am.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of Mexico Poniente) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (State of Mexico East).
Once the goal of gathering 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independencia Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and identify in Mexican children and young people risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
When World Diabetes Day was celebrated on November 14, he said that the objective is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on food.
They will also be asked about physical activity and inherited family history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturdays anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure taking, determination of glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol and insulin and genetic levels (it seeks to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López pointed out that this research is due to the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
'The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity, and of girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight, a dramatic rise was also observed," said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for the markers is based on the fact that the country's population differs from others due to its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent of American Indian, 30 percent European and five percent African heritage and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive evaluation of the children, which allows detecting if they have some degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark folds (acantosis) in the neck and forearm, which indicate the probability of suffering from metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors give it in writing to the parents, who are explained each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, sitting most of the day in front of the television and using means of transportation instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, that is, the greater consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetics that is analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of the UNAM, develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals sent by the pavement were heeded, it would not be necessary to repair about 200,000 potholes each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who said that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is adequate,  Potholes could be reduced in quantity or even eliminated completely.
In his lecture A technological opinion of potholes, dictated in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory in charge develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called maltenos, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt is that at high temperatures, close to 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but is modified during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warned the specialist in chemical engineering.
The CF researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which is composed of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the pebbles that constitute the folder, he said, is bathed with asphalt.
When vehicles travel and generate efforts, it allows the forces to diffuse very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt, they would spread even better, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt folder, he added, a last layer called rolling folder is placed, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As it is the layer that will be in contact with the tires of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the road.
Being the part of the pavement that will receive and diffuse the efforts, the rolling folder also requires having the appropriate thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken care of.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it greatly affects the performance of the asphalt binder.
When the ground gets wet, the water diffuses inside the folder and it is difficult for it to come out, this causes a softening of all the layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
In the process of forming a pothole, he said, the first to wear out is the bearing film and only then is the asphalt folder affected, but the damage does not occur instantaneously, but it is a process that should be attended to at the first signs with adequate maintenance programs.
The also member of the National System of Researchers explained that the vehicular load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement must always be in relation to the vehicular load and ensure that it is complied with, to avoid that potholes form frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and allow to repair potholes easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced Melina Ramírez Serna not to reach the crown of Señorita Colombia.
El Valle receives her 14th title of princess.
Again Valle del Cauca is left with the desire for the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the winners' podium, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredit her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico won the crown and the scepter, the department already has 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who have been close to the crown but who were proclaimed princesses including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949),  Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many ask themselves is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles obtained by queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision made by the jury to appoint her First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Martín Murillo Gómez, from the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
To the questioner, the Valle del Cauca responded:
"I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it's a way to culturalize, I definitely think that the book that marked me as a child is "The Little Prince", it is a very deep book.
Currently I read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and today I am reading the book by Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood."
An answer that little liked first for the term "culturalize" and second for not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books he cited have marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise no matter what has to happen.
And for all the people, please read a little bit, "The Little Prince" is a great book."
Among the hypotheses launched, it is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A Bogota journalist insinuated that being the favorite, the cheered and the candidate who took all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best handmade costume, and Queen Mother), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that is why she did not shine on stage."
And that showed in his first swimsuit performance at the Hilton Beach and his two parades on the coronation evening.
Although in both she looked confident, it was noted that she lacked the strength and impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico did show.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for Canal RCN's "Como en casa" program, said that the fact that Melina was named a princess "proves that the candidate who wins the most awards during the contest is not queen."
In addition, Valle was very elusive with the press, and there she was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
For some reason, two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on their social sensitivity, that before entering the Contest they are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned because of her defects in the derriere and fibrosis that was noticeable in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural beauty' with the healthiest body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
The queen trainer Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, "but her fibrosis problem in the abdomen, which the truth for me was not very noticeable, dropped points on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the Valle del Cauca were the surgical interventions that were practiced.
"The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
His body was never his forte, and here they charged him."
For this award, which for the first time delivers the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in swimsuit a cruel prediction arose that last night was fulfilled, because it was said that this was the contentment that Raymundo granted to Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina from today begins a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the possibility of representing Colombia in one of the international contests by designation of the National Contest itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, was elusive the crown.
This was the work of the caleño who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lofoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a lofoscopist of the CTI of Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the FARC's top leader, "Alfonso Cano," through the comparison of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lofoscopists who work in the CTI section, that week it was the turn of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to go for more than five days in the jungle to reach the place where the bodies that had to be identified were.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after completing the corresponding courses, he specialized in lofoscopy, which is the study of frictional skin, that is, the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to wear clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be the man who led the oldest guerrilla group in the world, so they asked him to carry the decadactylar card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the site where the body was located, he did not recognize it because of his physical appearance, as it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was beardedless, dressed like a local peasant, without glasses and much thinner.
But footprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.
His eye did not fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon that he was indeed the top leader of the FARC.
In search of the footprint
For a fingerprintist of the Sijin of Cali, the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, in the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no margin for error, which can be key in solving crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, lofoscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of those captured.
When caught, many criminals present false ID cards or do not have papers.
We fingerprint them and look them up in the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to take out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not appropriate surfaces to get a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to obtain the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also rule out or reaffirm suspects in homicide cases.
They recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a relative could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a footprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the murderer, it does place him at the scene of the crime.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that on objects "fingerprints are taken with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said the CTI expert.
He clarified that not everything is as shown on the CSI TV show.
Just as not everything that glitters is gold, not everything that is touched becomes a footprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective comparison is made.
The "indignant" defy authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded outside Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part complied with the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement defied the authorities of New York on Tuesday by trying to enter again, under the protection of a court order, the Manhattan square from where they were evicted at dawn and trying to occupy another park in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order that allows the "indignados" to return to camp in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
"Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to camp in the square again, we will settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray explained that the response of the "outraged" to the eviction of their camp personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the protesters to remain camped.
In addition, the "indignados" proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by the parish of Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police went and proceeded to arrest some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while he assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization assures that there are several hundred people who had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved in a show of support for the members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the Police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square – which is a privately owned enclosure – remains closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analyzed.
Some of the demonstrators displaced there carried and distributed copies of that judicial order at this time and even delivered them to the agents who guarded the square, which caused "some small confrontations," said Bray, who denounced that some officers beat the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting Occupy Wall Street members or enforcing "laws that were published after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with shops or other property they previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, alerting them, however, that local laws do not allow them to reinstall themselves with tents and sleeping bags.
The councilman personally defended the eviction carried out at dawn from Zuccotti Square, an operation in which around 200 arrests were made and which was decided because the demonstrators were "violating the law."
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people," since "some businesses had received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life."
"The eviction this morning was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of "disrespecting freedom of expression."
The officials of "Occupy Wall Street" also indicated that they plan to organize "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months of the protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will play the Virgin Mary in a Christmas television special
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement," lifeguard on "Baywatch," "Playboy" bunny, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (balladeer) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images from the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide distribution on the Internet of a pornographic home video in which she appears along with her then-husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently performed as a presenter on part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Jose.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is no stranger to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a "slut" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan reborn after earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of falls that began in March
Since last March the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still convalescing from the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe suffered by the Japanese country since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government put the material losses at 300,000 million dollars, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have attenuated.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September served to turn the page, definitively: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% at an annualized rate.
The one recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth rate since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is explained, in part, by the rebound in the purchase of machinery to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decline in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first setback after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real shock of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of crises to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructure, to use shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed 1%, driven by the increase in spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "safe haven securities" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro zone and the murky forecasts of the US, a privilege that weighs like a slab on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic waterline is determined by the health of big tech groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed their weak results between July and September on the yen.
While the markets continue with their siege on the peripheral countries of the EU, the government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lower its guard.
"We must be attentive to the risks that remain, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
And, indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that most member countries showed clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator anticipating turning points in the world economy highlighted that the major powers are slowing down.
Since it fell four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro zone was even below the average, which is at level 100, falling eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens feeds doubts again
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but conservatives won't sign any written pledges
With peripheral risk premia skyrocketing and uncertainty reinstated in the trading floors, Greece continues to get entangled in the labyrinth that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days agreed in his appointment may fall short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections by the scheduled date.  on February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the summit of October 26," said Papadimos when opening yesterday a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package with 24 programs to boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not dispel doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else."
The conservative leader went a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give his approval to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still scounted by the impact caused by the order of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, although there is no definitive date either.
The Greek skein still has thread for a while.
Doña Sofía: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "preponderant" place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a preponderant place worldwide in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the proposal in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" said that it lies in being an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity,  based on trust in the human being."
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V World Summit of Microcredit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with horizon 2015, and, "especially, in that which aims to reduce by half the volume of people living with incomes of less than one dollar a day,  with which the "poverty line" is fixed.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Doña Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate in the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest,  and especially for women", main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are "many achievements" and "many challenges we face".
The Microcredit Summit is proposed not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that it is hoped that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of those households will leave the poverty line in which they are immersed.
The impulse in the conception of microcredits in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the path initiated years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Doña Sofía as an "act of justice and due recognition".
He described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about its lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all of them I have been able to verify the continuous evolution," explained His Majesty, whose link with this project earned him yesterday the qualification of the "head of family" gathered in Valladolid by the "baquero of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofía concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, he explained that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, since it is a "permanent obligation."
Jiménez considered that microcredits represent "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty," and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be a victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the "excluded people to whom everyone closes the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors infected with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday 14th November in Leipzig, passed without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
Initially, the future of Europe had not been included on the agenda, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy militants who consider that the government's policy is currently too lax with the Greeks and could be in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were recorded.
The standing ovation of several minutes that were won, with their interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, clear up any possible doubt.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, are summed up in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open the way in Europe".
This could take the form of amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of euro area countries, but could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give Europe a face".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
To be sure, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly agree on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the European Central Bank's directive according to the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen Germany's weight.
Anxious to calm tempers within her party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But neither has he tried to win over his congress at the expense of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of "Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not mentioned France.
Except in passing.
Remembering that, two centuries ago, a bloody battle took place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The incidence of fraud in sick leave
Following the subsidies, the UMP and the government launch an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15th November to visit a fund responsible for family allowances and give a speech on the theme, which has been recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and assistantship.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which starts from the will to save rigorously, but still reminds of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, most want to focus on sick leave.
First, to implement budget cuts: the government plans to impose a fourth day of grace on private sector workers before they can take leave.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days of salary, that is, a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
It is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: imposing on civil servants a day of absence without pay in case of sick leave (so far, they have no lack, compared to the three days applied in the private sector).
While these issues are being debated, most are also putting the issue of fraud on the table, this time oriented towards the abuses of sick leave.
"The controls will be considerably increased and, in addition, if someone is caught committing fraud, they must reimburse the amounts," warned Xavier Bertrand speaking on RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement seem slightly disproportionate to the reality of fraud in terms of sick leave.
In fact, since 2002 this issue has been constantly monitored and a number of political offensives have been launched that have usually borne fruit.
The French do not get sick more than in the rest of Europe.
Let us first look closely at the national figures.
According to the French Social Security Institute (CNAM), more than €237 million in sick leave benefits were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, subsidies for sick leave represented, in 2008, 5% of health expenditure, amounting to 11,300 million euros.
Of this sum, 46% corresponds to maternity and work-related leave, while 54% is related to sick leave, a figure that amounts to 6,200 million euros.
Consequently, 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that undoubtedly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, in this case from Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 22% lasted between 8 and 14 days, 15% lasted between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer.
Compared to our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A lengthy study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate from work (for both health and other reasons) ranged from 10% to 11% in France, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick leave is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud is quite limited in scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM found, in 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term absences were "unjustified or too long", that is, 37,050 cases.
In the case of absences of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11% of the cases were considered to be "duly adapted or unjustified; A figure that, taking as a starting point a total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132,000.
As a result, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who took sick leave.
Undoubtedly, an insignificant figure in comparison, for example, with black work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, such a practice would represent tax revenue losses of between €9 billion and €15 billion per year, i.e. more than the total cost of sick leave subsidies and certainly considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papadémos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to straighten out its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos declared before Parliament on Monday 14 November; He also added that the hundred days granted to his Union Government would not be sufficient to achieve that goal.
"To make efforts that lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment program," said the head of government, who was delivering his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the euro zone summit on October 27 will be the "main task" of the new government, since "at stake" the country's permanence in the euro area, he added.
Consequently, Papadémos has predicted that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to around 9%" of GDP before the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, on Monday showed his support for measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said during a meeting with deputies from his New Democracy party.
He said he agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, as well as fighting waste, but against any policy that impedes economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the loan of 8,000 million euros needed without a written guarantee of the support of all parties to the planned measures, Antonio Samaras has responded that his word would be enough and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
Expert committee says euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they wish to die and make arrangements to that effect.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code so as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient considers this option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
For starters, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks tenth, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death."
Medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, although most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard is recorded in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with persons who are not competent or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
Recall that 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favor of euthanasia, since they believe that it would allow people whose death is close to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
As for people who have practiced assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that proceedings should not be initiated against them.
In relation to the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report.
In addition, among their recommendations they suggest that the Criminal Code should indicate that the withdrawal of health care, if it has been legally rejected, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The expert committee also calls for health professionals to be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses end-of-life care without fear of facing a complaint.
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in health institutions in Canada, the committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be considered euthanasia and undergo the same procedures.
Other experts express reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described as "extreme" the position of the experts who sign the report, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to the terminally ill.
"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and is over 18 can ask for help to commit suicide," said Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to prioritise personal autonomy over any other value of society.
However, he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations."
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the report's findings, which she called a "manifesto in favor of euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, especially questions the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King urges President Assad to leave power
Damascus denounces a "plot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar al-Assad's partisans demonstrated yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry building.
Yesterday the diplomatic pressure on Bashar al-Assad's Syria intensified, which, with the support of Russia, resists it and denounces that there is a "plot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbours, have spoken out in favour of President Assad leaving power.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "leave power" in Syria, where forty civilians and members of the regime's forces have already died.
"If Bashar really cares about his country, he should resign, as well as create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Syria's neighbour Jordan said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that the mediation efforts that Turkey has been carrying out since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country on which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime".
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking an increasingly harsh tone" regarding the crackdown in Syria, said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of regime forces have already lost their lives in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) has announced.
Two other civilians have died "during bombings and heavy machine gun firefights in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, the Syrian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid Al Mualem, considers for his part that the country "is moving towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, he has reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its functions, which in his opinion constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not waver," he added, guaranteeing that "plots hatched against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "mechanism for the protection of civilians" and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, has also expressed his support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime that, in his opinion, is locked in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to fine-tune the implementation of the exit plan from the crisis adopted on 2 November, which provides, in particular, for the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the hands of the opposition and the release of detained demonstrators.
The Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, has judged yesterday as "incorrect" the decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan from the crisis, although it did not express its support for the application of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time from the markets and sacrifices from the Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and launch a program that will include "sacrifices" aimed at recovering the credibility lost during the last months of Berlusconi's government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with the political parties and today he met with the trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively narrow cabinet, composed of technocrats outside parliament.
"Monti spoke of an extensive program with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a deputy from one of the many small parliamentary groups that took part in the meetings, after meeting with the appointed Council President.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr Monti presenting a limited list, no doubt of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to form a government and prepare its program, he stressed, adding that he is "sure that the markets will have patience and will understand."
His appointment by the President initially won market approval, but concerns followed, particularly following an unforeseen fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should create a team mainly made up of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include "politicians."
The new government should function until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he believes.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the vote of confidence of the Parliament before Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when he takes office, he will work taking into account the urgency and with the aim of Italy "regaining its prominence" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not reach its goal of achieving a balanced budget in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for new measures of rigor.
The Italian "head of the bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see the mates, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow cannot respect the requirements in terms of deficit."
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy," according to editorialists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to place some €200 billion in state bonds by April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran on developing a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by the UN agency.
The IAEA last week expressed "grave concern" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear center in Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact, in 1995, with the Embassy of Iran in Ukraine.
Afterward, he is believed to have cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, as reported by a member state to the Agency, worked for most of his career on such technology in the military nuclear program of his country of origin. "
Crimes and offences against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and offenses against Muslims have increased by about 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics released by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is, it has increased by 49%, compared to a 13% increase in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14% in the number of anti-religious crimes and offenses.
The total number of "hate crimes" has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing that such crimes and offences have increased again," Human Rights First said, "the increase in violence against Muslims is especially significant," the organization said in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long argued that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," said Paul Legendre, an official at Human Rights First.
"The U.S. government can and should strive to end such abuses," he adds, considering that such efforts could include improved police reporting of "hate crimes."
"Hate crime" in US federal law was inherited from the civil rights era.
The legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter on Monday modified the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which makes its service look a little more like Facebook's.
A new "activity" tab and another called "name" allow you to follow more legibly and live the activity of other "Tweets", that is, those Internet users whose messages ("tweets") are still on the Internet or who follow you.
This lets you know if they track messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they rate a message as a favorite, etc.
Twitter's new formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its non-instinctive functioning, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from another person, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable to celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users have debated the interest of this innovation with "tweets" with different opinions.
"It's useless, invasive and looks too much like Facebook," @jemb123 writes.
"The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter flow," @dannykronstrom writes.
Austria
Introduction of a budgetary "golden rule" in the Constitution
The government of the Social Democratic/Christian Democrat grand coalition that is in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a budgetary "golden rule" to reduce the public deficit and, thus, avoid a possible downgrade of Austria's sovereign rating by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when Austrian public debt reaches 74.6%, a figure much higher than the maximum limit of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced by a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay 3 billion euros more in interest every year," said Christian Democrat Vice Chancellor for Foreign Affairs Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is thus responding to a request from the Brussels Summit to the member countries of the euro zone on 26th October last: in it the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the restoration of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a law with equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt this type of "rule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states, as well as communes, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is that, by 2020/2021, public debt will be reduced under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens new foreign exchange intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we see that there is excessive volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the all-time highs produced by the intervention of the Japanese authorities on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the US currency.
But the yen has been steadily recovering since then, boosted by purchases by investors who consider it a "safe haven" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar traded again on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic 105 yen bar, reaching levels close to those that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago, since it makes Made in Japan products more expensive and reduces the value of the income obtained abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the northeastern Tohoku region, Noda said, fearing that rising yen prices will nip the weak recovery in the bud.
The third world economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and household consumption affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect Japan's "economic foundations."
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", hinting that further monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Treasury Bills by five trillion yen (47,000 million euros), bringing to 55 trillion yen (519,000 million euros) the threshold of the funds it dedicates to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
Guys grow, pockets falter
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to hurt European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as improved growth figures in France and Germany, rates in the weaker countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the stability of the euro area, European stock markets plunge a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 am, the CAC 40 lost 1.4% and stood at 3,064 points.
The Dax lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
"Given the new tensions regarding loan yields from the hardest-hit euro area states, stock markets around the world continue to deliver some of their recent gains."
"Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion," said Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, renewing market traders' concerns about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its sights fixed on Europe and exchanges will continue to take place in a narrow margin of variations, so investors will not have proof that the situation has stabilized," said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The reappearance of worries about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to the corridors, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, which met on Monday in Congress, adopted a motion that provides, in particular, for the option of a country in difficulty leaving the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far exceed 6%
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, while Spanish bonds with the same term offered 6.2%.
These tensions in relation to interest rates in the countries of the South, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the financial controllers.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which risks suffocating with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, said that implementing the decisions taken at the euro zone summit on 27th October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the crosshairs of the markets, while legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The spread between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new all-time high.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
From a statistical point of view, France has registered an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, that is, a more favorable figure than the 0.3% expected, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised downwards the figure for the second quarter, with a reduction of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries economists.
Germany, meanwhile, has recorded growth of 0.5% in the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must be worth more than dogmas
If there is one issue that cannot be dealt with taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is fitting that an election meeting should be the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it considers the overall economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will mean the doubling of electricity demand before 2050, unless a huge part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the increasing scarcity of fossil resources will have to be alleviated in order to continue producing electricity continuously, not forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear power.
That is not the case either in Belgium, which subjects its own to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, or in Switzerland, which only aims to build state-of-the-art power stations.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few examples, are moving forward with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality goes against such a discourse.
The choice of Berlin will mean an increase in the price of electricity, greater energy dependence due to the increased need for imported gas, particularly from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions due to the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noticeable.
Consideration should be given to the case of Denmark.
European champion in the wind sector, from which it obtains 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittency of the wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining industrial utility on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would detract from the realism of the wonderful declarations about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not express opposition on principle to this type of energy, polls show.
Let us remember that the energy policy of our country has lost to build an industrial sector with 125,000 director jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Broadly export-oriented, it encompasses a galaxy of SMEs specialising in international markets and which can create non-relocatable jobs.
If France were to decide to abandon nuclear energy, it would mean the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of 6,000 million euros per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would order an EPR designed to operate sixty years, when its manufacturer is expected to collapse?
To solve the nuclear power equation, we must admit that there is no miracle source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source.
Areva's development of low-CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a Safety Authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both the existing plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our highly professional teams are also obsessed with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, was produced under normal operating conditions; It did not cause consequences for people or the environment.
At Chernobyl, the accident was due to reactor design and unforgivable human failure.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented scope, which killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, just as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to this progress and cooperation between the security authorities and French and German operators and builders, the ERP presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is studied by all the electrical players who want to build a plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since it would leave them free to assume the leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy pursued by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with France's self-proclaimed status as a "country of human rights".
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the newspaper Libération of May 23) proclaiming in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters."
However, it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the tone by declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has about two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take care of all the misery in the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act towards immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande limits himself to including banalities, indicating that co-development will solve the "problem of migration".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be profitable electorally, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent paper summarizing the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among scholars on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth.  wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Limiting immigration weakens growth and hurts employment.
Fears about the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace domestic workers, particularly low-skilled workers, by pushing for lower wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are more complementary than substitutes for national workers and mainly work in sectors with no employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for personnel.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that has a lack of anaesthetists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to positively influence the salaries and employment of nationals.
Taking into account the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migratory flows means a rise in real wages in the long term of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel laureates and companies such as Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, contributing on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization calculates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenses) of 150,000 euros to public budgets on average over his lifetime.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the growth points that he lacked "with his teeth".
Such teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it only needs to think about a European democracy
Democracy is a precious commodity, but also a fragile one.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the twentieth century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some perhaps believed that, for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be enough to exercise the vote and in the most direct way possible.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little", that it was something thought out.
Universal suffrage, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not sufficient in itself and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacolot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this respect, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be reflected upon in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer moving in a good way.
We will not gain if we demand a succession of national referendums, organised according to needs and in a disorderly manner.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a stop to the void of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to strike blows, but a common, fully-fledged, calm and continuous exercise of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis of Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that bends to the orders of the markets and the rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is Europe as a whole that suffers humiliation in the international arena.
We worry about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is the whole of Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is for popular sovereignty to regain the helm of the European project.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and prepare their future through investments.
A way out of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
Having fought for a long time against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
So be it.
But to think of it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being experienced as such by the citizens, would be a new folly and would lead us to a new stalemate.
We must enter a new stage in the construction of Europe.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
Interest-driven Revolution would not be enough.
This lesson is still applicable.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
It can only be achieved by building a more politically democratic Europe, a genuine European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us become Europeans.
"Contactless" chip cards become widespread
The world show of chip cards opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, phones with SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6,000 million units, according to calculations by the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most powerful segment is contactless technology, which allows you to pay for common transport or purchases simply by bringing the card to a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than last year!
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units are expected) and represent about 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payment sector.
Around 26 million Visa bank cards already have this feature, which is accepted at 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But large stores work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard cards this year.
To get the gear up, however, it is necessary for banks to make them available to their customers.
"There are two major French establishments that are committed to systematically disseminating contactless bank cards to their customers in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile phone payment
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, essential to carry out transactions.
"They're lagging behind."
"But it should finally experience a real boom next year."
"We anticipate that between 80 and 120 million units will be sold worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But banks are taking the lead.
The bank Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a cover that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale also said yesterday that it is preparing to market an offer that allows its customers to pay contactless via their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris worries about links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqim) and the long-suspected Nigerian sect of Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers already "has the certainty."
"The way both organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that they are cooperating," he said, without elaborating.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January reportedly resumed the catwalks.
Abducted from a restaurant in Niamey by people linked to Aqim, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The study of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers particularly caught the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria that is home to Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is allegedly close to Aqim and the sect.
"This is progress, but we certainly have to wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqim and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is becoming more active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" had become increasingly evident in the evolution and discourse of Boko Haram or in its modes of operation, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices that are increasingly complex and similar to those used by Aqim.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressuring Abuja to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long regarded the group as an enlightened community unworthy of interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in Hausa, "Western education is a sin"), encourages the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It is politicized and demands strict respect for sharia, while its militants throw themselves into the fight against the impious central government.
The latter are oriented in the first place to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and attacks on police stations multiplied.
The Abuja reaction was, as is often the case, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, is killed in prison.
Since then, the sect is radicalized and abandons its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, he claimed responsibility for an attack that caused 80 deaths in Jos and, later, another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuja, in particular the protected police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, stretching from Mauritania to Somalia to Nigeria, worries all security specialists.
While Aqim has attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Chebab's Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all information".
The World According to Republican Presidential Candidates
In relation to China, Iran, and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
Can an America weakened by crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the Republican presidential candidates, voters might think so.
In recent days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making more and more thunderous statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of Republicans.
Slogans, often unfounded, are spread about China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the nomination by the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "for manipulation of their currency", a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of its sector to Asia.
It doesn't matter if that means the outbreak of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated view of foreign policy, almost drowns in an attitude that "overwhelms" emotions.
He has called for a firm, but constructive, dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
Reagan style
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt its nuclear program.
"If I get elected, I will stop Iran," he blustered.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed with his obligations to Israel.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second-highest ranked candidate, shows shameful ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he urged countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing "tries to develop nuclear capability", apparently ignoring the fact that China already has the military atom since 1964.
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with 2008 Republican nominee John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president counter that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naïve dialogue with Iran, on the hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq and on their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it weak.
But the attacks are not easy for them.
The population judges in a rather positive way the national security balance of Obama, which killed Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he is wary of military interventions that generate a sinking.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically to resurrect his leadership, Obama gives the impression of being fairer.
Nord Stream, new gateway for Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which directly links Western Europe with Russia via the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, in the inauguration of Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that communicates, directly under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have together turned the steering wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western European grid.
With this new pipeline, each year an additional 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will reach Western Europe through a first 1,224 km crossing the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second pipe should be completed by the end of 2012 that will supply a total of 55,000 million cubic meters of gas, that is, enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube along the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this enormous work presents an air of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding the passage of land through third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of the Europe of energy, given that the project has generated a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has been able, in just five years, to make triumph its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries, large consumers of gas and with increasingly limited reserves.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically," François Fillon confirmed during the inauguration of the pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large contracts in the gas sector are as political as they are economic.
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of Gazprom executives, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it against ships' anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
"It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution," says Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to take extreme measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs about 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted along its entire length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Swedish waters, but those responsible for the project gave it up when they saw that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state company to settle permanently in the sea off their coasts.
"In the event of a breakdown, we will interrupt the passage of gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But builders consider a leak unlikely, as they have predicted joints that are expected to leak every 100,000 years.
The condition of the pipeline is monitored by an underwater robot, pulled by a vessel, which carries out external inspections, as well as by a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides precise data on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without the need for any repair.
Gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
At the beginning it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
It was joined by Germany's E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as Netherlands' Gasunie and France's GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, responsible for building and operating the pipeline.
It is based in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased all the gas transmission capacity to Gazprom for a renewable period of twenty-five years.
"Gazprom will be paid for the total capacity, regardless of how much gas is actually transported," says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline has been carried out by 30% with the contribution of shareholders and 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7,400 million euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will not exceed their investment, since Gazprom alone bears the risk of expenses.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic at Lubmin, on a sandy shoreline planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas exit door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a branded notebook.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people back a taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, of hours of writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its off-white leaves, as if aged by time.
However, Moleskine notebooks with the current look were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a design notebook, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, was in charge of launching the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the stools.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to today's taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the twentieth century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become head of the brand at Modo Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Gone is the confidential production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook attracts businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which had twelve employees in its beginnings, now has about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the center of the cities, and has managed to impose his identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also launched a notebook with leopard covers, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has managed to diversify its products: bags, diaries, pens, computer cases... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19 per cent of disabled people are looking for a job.
The XV Week for the Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a resolute public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people is double the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the population as a whole.
Daunting?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, the association that organises the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made over the past fifteen years is considerable.
"Back then, the unemployment rate was not twice as high as the average.
"However, there is still a lot to do."
It is worth mentioning that the disabled unemployed continue to face numerous obstacles in accessing employment.
They tend to be older: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not completed high school and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% on average.
That is, there are many issues that make it particularly difficult to return to the world of work and that "are the crux of the problem," says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those that are not mentioned; People's mindsets are advancing, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association for the Cité noted that the directors surveyed have "a low level of knowledge about disabilities", with an "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, physically or intellectually disabled".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hiring 6% disabled workers, a goal that was set in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest available figures, dating from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
"Now we reach around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body in charge of collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The proof: the number of establishments "subject to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has created great pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects real awareness, particularly among large groups."
According to the Ministry of Labor, only 59% of companies with between 20 and 49 workers have disabled employees in their workforce, compared to 82% of companies with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A joy"
About to face the Bleus on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly match generates for them.
We will not dare to say that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the stage of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after his striker's gesture of resentment against Turkey, the Belgium coach has nothing but praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for his progress and for him to be Belgian."
"I want to move forward," the Lille striker replies.
As for the contrast between his presentations in his team and in the selection, "it is a set", he has justified.
"I'm in Lille all year round, which doesn't apply to Belgium.
"I have to situate myself."
Called up to play Romania on Friday night, considering this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to, finally, "shine".
Without forgetting the "pleasure".
He has been cheering for the Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been his fan," he says.
Undoubtedly, this will especially reinforce the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially since he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
"We just faced each other recently.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
Quite simply, Leekens has made reference to "pride".
"Pride" for playing "a gala match".
"Pride" also to verify, as a "neighbor", that France "is again a very high level team", about a year after Knysna's injury.
"Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job," he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the coach would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Bleus to... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing up," he said.
"We're building something; The players are ambitious, they are hungry.
"You'll be able to see it in the next few games." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Paulo Bento's Portugal faces with great optimism the second leg against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first leg, both teams lacked realism.
"When these 90 minutes are up, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt; the Selecçao, which he has managed since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Taking into account the first leg (0-0), on Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems clear that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, yes, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given them peace of mind.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we didn't score away from home."
But at home, in the bright Stadium of Light in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before a public that should be just as enthusiastic, even if it is evident that the match "is very even", dixit an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope the match will be very even, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of participating in Euro 2012," Carlos Queiroz's successor has relativized.
Friday's draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a draw, although they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't scored away from home," laments Bento.
"We are going to play against a team that has great technical quality and has players with great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "not leave them time to think".
A good idea, provided that, this time, it is realistic.
