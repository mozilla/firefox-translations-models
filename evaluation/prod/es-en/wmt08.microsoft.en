European inflation slipped into food
Accelerated inflation in the euro area is primarily due to the breakneck growth in food prices.
The increase in prices in the month of November has been higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro area, registering - after 2.6 percent in October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - announced the Statistical Office of the Union based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts only gave 3 percent as likely, Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut basic interest rates, on the pretext that the decline, together with rising commodity prices and reduced forced unemployment, would spiral inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "you have to negotiate" on inflation so that it does not have to intervene in this issue later.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, recorded in Germany, broke the twelve-year record; while in Spain it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation soared in the euro area as a result of soaring food and energy prices.
Forward quotations for wheat increased by 88 percent and soybean prices reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased this year by 52 percent, reaching almost $100 a barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from the current 2.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent, while by 2009 it will already fall to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain around 3 percent in the next 3 or 4 months, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to cut interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long stalemate, by early December support for the Alliance of Young Democrats increased significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, while Gallup has never before experienced such a low level – 13 percent – in the case of the Socialists.
The difference in the case of secure party voters - due to the firmer strength of opposition voters - would mean more than two-thirds support (71 percent) compared to one-fifth support for the Socialists (20 percent).
According to the poll, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach even the necessary limit to have any parliamentary seat: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among safe voters there are one percent more supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the previous low point - it has never been higher, with 41 percent of those who judged the country's economic situation especially bad, while another 46 percent believe the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the more hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As far as the next year is concerned, the majority of the population is counting on the deterioration of the situation and only a tenth expects improvement.
In December, 71 percent of those consulted, a figure higher than any previous Gallup poll, estimated that the President of the Government rather performs his functions badly than well.
13 percent of respondents trust or trust Ferenc Gyurcsány a lot, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of those consulted.
54 percent of the population does not trust the Head of Government at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced vis-à-vis the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year 35 per cent felt that it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government in power, this proportion is currently only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) believe that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the question about participation answered that they would surely participate and another 20 percent said they are likely to participate.
By way of comparison, in "a general election to be held this Sunday" only 55 percent of the population would surely participate and another 15 percent believe their participation is likely. Based on the current intentions of the voters, there is no doubt about the outcome of the referendum.
74 percent of the population would disapprove of the payment of study fees, 79 percent of medical consultations and 84 percent of hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of study fees, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupled its prices
The hypermarkets of the Budaörs gold trading triangle maintained the average price level increase of 16 percent, with the difference that VAT has not been increased this year.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the gold trading triangle of Budaörs the usual Christmas basket of the newspaper Napi, but in all hypermarkets there was a growth well above one thousand HUF.
As in December of last year prices in food supermarkets had already "skyrocketed", so there was no drastic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below nine thousand HUF, today they cannot do even for ten thousand.
Napi's basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded with a minimum of 91 HUF the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(in 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a sharp increase in turkey breast fillet, walnut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in the Auchan we have also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was equally surprising in this store that the price of Coca-Cola with a two-litre redeemable bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in the basket of Napi Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to last year's Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15 percent, while Tesco and Auchan with about 18 percent the prices listed in Napi's basket.
Comparing the values of the most expensive basket of last year with that of the cheapest basket of this year, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between the cheapest of last year and the most expensive of this year has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was HUF 1206, so that during Christmas last year prices felt the VAT increase.
It was precisely this process that destroyed trade, supermarkets were visibly unable to make a decision on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of price changes on consumption.
(If the merchant plans poorly the speed of a product's circulation, he may lose a significant profit on the margin that adjusts to the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of Napi's basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, that the most expensive was higher with HUF 1720 than the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only HUF 844.
This year there were no such extremes, since the highest price now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets the price of basic consumer items grew more than 30 percent.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some staple foods, registered in the interval of 12 months a price increase of more than 30 percent.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of eggs.)
According to Napi's basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive and last year compared to the base, it was registered, in the worst case only a 10 percent increase in prices.
According to all indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, being able to impose the drastic increase in prices even on multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the gold trading triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experiences, most consumers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, taking the preserved food by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, large queues formed in front of the checkouts at all three stores because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that in the interior of the country sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to the survey institutes because the income is below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
This year, several thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals, caused primarily by the improper application of antibiotics.
The prevailing hygiene circumstances in hospitals, overcrowded beds and overloaded staff are not conducive to infection control, says the physician-head of department at the National Epidemiology Center.
In many hospitals you save even with disinfectants.
Not long ago, a contagion with MRSA has been diagnosed in the traumatology department of the János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
A person injured in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient shortly after had to return to the hospital as a result of the contagion with MRSA and since then it has not been possible to perform a major surgical intervention due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
As of December 10 of this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection caused by multiresistant agents have been registered in the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, medical department head of the National Epidemiology Center.
This means that hospitals have certainly recorded this number of infections caused by multiresistant agents, the rest there is no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, the methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
One-third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without causing any disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g., throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once overapplied or improperly to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics transform into highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria and spread quickly in inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infections or septicaemia primarily in patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, patients with weakened organism, the elderly or underweight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the Hospital János there is nothing special about the infection of MRSA, these infections are daily in hospitals.
Infection should not be confused with epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotic resistant
"These patients are isolated, the nurses care for them in rubber gloves and masks and there are the right antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are pre-screened for MRSA in their body, but even then infection cannot be avoided in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital infections of MRSA in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances are not conducive to the prevention of formation and contagion with multiresistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
Because this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should screen hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients who carry MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not finance these medical examinations.
So most cases come to light when MRSA infections are already visible in the patient - said the doctor-head of department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes strict mandates for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological conditions.
It is necessary to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, that is, microbiological tests should be done to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less frequent in the case of outpatients or in basic care - said Karolina Böröcz.
Save with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is spread from one patient to another through healthcare workers.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, but also in this regard considerable shortages are experienced in hospitals.
MRSA is spread through droplet transmission and direct person-to-person contact, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
What's more, hospital wards are often crowded, beds are often close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated by at least 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately it can also be experienced - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals with a less favorable economic situation you save with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and that is why there is a greater probability for infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where adequate prevention measures are adhered to, fewer infections of this type are registered or the spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government Program Against MRSA
Treating the spread of infection with MRSA is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so it is being fought in all countries.
In England, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
Apparently the program is successful, according to the data provided, infections with MRSA show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multiresistant agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative breathalyzer test of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report has been made on the case of the fatal accident caused by the commander of the police of the XXII district.
It can be excluded the possibility that the since then resigned commander of the XXII district police, who on Tuesday ran over and caused the death of a passer-by - Attila Morvai, spokesman for the Attorney General's Office of the Capital, said on Friday after the expert report on the case had been prepared.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary breathalyzer test that had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic beverage before getting behind the wheel.
The then chief of the police station of the XXII district, on Tuesday with his private vehicle when turning to Kossuth Lajos Street in District XXII ran over a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the area designated for pedestrians.
(This last fact, that is, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Traffic Code are not extenuating circumstances, the driver must always yield the right of way when turning.)
The passerby lost his life after being hospitalized.
Because of what happened, the district police leader resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is being conducted by the Budapest Investigative Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the beginning collaborated with the prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
€400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice-President Marta Gajecka signed three credit cap agreements worth a total of 400 million euros in Budapest on Friday to finance education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget transport and environmental protection projects, to be carried out from the cohesion fund grant, for which the parties had previously signed a credit agreement worth EUR 100 million,  The contract they have just signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The €150 million loan agreement is also intended to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this objective of Hungary, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million the decision will be taken later, when extending the credit agreement.
The parties signed a contract for 50 million euros for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the innovations and research project of the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the construction of the 4th Metro line.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary finalizes with the EU the details of the financing of the Metro, they will return to the issue of whether or not it is necessary to modify the original contract and how to do it.
According to János Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth €8.4 billion.
The interest on the loans is adjusted to the EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charging a fee for keeping the credit available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate haven
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of all Europe is directed towards that Balkan country mentioned above.
What, where and who buys on the even cheaper EU market, which will quickly become more expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred target for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap ski apartments and beach chalets.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the beaches Albena, the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sol", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate also around Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts of Re/Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Rus.
In the same way, the capital Sofia can be attractive, the commercial and office spaces promise a rapid return on investment.
Bulgaria is on the best way to becoming one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, thus being a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria are also striving to change their lives and their way of life.
Most of the customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present, and traditionally there are many Russian customers on Black Sea beaches and ski havens.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renovate them later.
They demand good communication and access, and for them the proximity of a big city, shops and usually a local doctor is important.
The second category is the buyers of villas (Bulgaria in December was included among the top 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group is made up of real estate investors who make their purchases with the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of the capital's real estate is constantly growing, since the demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years these suffered an annual increase of 21 percent
The increase in the price of real estate considerably exceeds the growth of wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarians
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, the meetings at the expert level will be completed on Tuesday and on Wednesday after the official inauguration, negotiations at ministerial level on the post-2012 international climate regime will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap on post-emission reduction efforts, established in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
Lively discussions are currently taking place between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that for the moment it does not want to negotiate on precise figures, although it tends to agree that compared to the situation of 1990, until 2020 the emission of gases responsible for the greenhouse effect will decrease by 25 to 40 percent.
Another major theme of the conference is whether or not industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to offer material and technological aid to countries in need.
Agreement was also reached on the aid to be offered to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a board of directors composed of 16 members, probably within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) - writes the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's six percent
On behalf of Hungary, Minister for the Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to preserve its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister declared that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent compared to the 1990 level by 20 percent, regardless of whether or not the "post-2012 agreement" will be signed, and is ready to commit to reducing even 30 percent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to take on commitments commensurate with their responsibility and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to decrease by 5.2 percent, within this the then 15 EU member states committed to comply with an 8 percent decrease.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce by 6 percent the emission of gases responsible for the greenhouse effect compared to the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will comply with - according to the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali, because in two years' time the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed until after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments assumed in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international system of emission reductions, whose need was warned in its most recent report by the IPCC, the international scientific association of the UN that deals with climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would delay the reduction in emissions and could not prevent an increase of more than 2°C in the average temperature of the Earth, which scientists say would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
British army recruits on YouTube
British army units at a video distributor release footage of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) was the one that took advantage of YouTube services: special units deployed in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos about their actions against the Taliban - reported the BBC.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in the general operations corps of Kandahar, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There are already 139 recordings from air force soldiers that have been uploaded in this way to the Internet and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the Commonwealth Office and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had uploaded the videos with recruitment objectives, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defence they also serve to present to the public the true objective of the British army's presence abroad.
This type of propaganda costs virtually nothing compared to conventional television recruitment spots - defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC - instead, they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the raison d'être of the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the suspiciously edited and censored recordings, amateur videos also appear in the dealership, for example about the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers speak at most of losses, without however presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, numerous videos recorded in real operations have already been uploaded to the Internet from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army is only recently seizing this opportunity.
The Americans use a slightly different way of recruiting with the freely downloadable shooter video games called America's Army, in which in the middle of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly in place of the soldiers.
Tombola and salty cake at the ministries' Christmas party
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 with salty cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with a tombola and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - this is how power has fun.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defense, but not for Ministry workers.
At the Christmas of the Orphans the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts and for the Christmas of the Missionaries the relatives of the soldiers who are currently serving missions abroad are invited. A reception for the press will also be offered.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the festive atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a luxurious party regarding the parties of the other portfolios
The MET party will be held at the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4,320,000 HUF and of the six hundred workers of the ministry the presence of approximately three hundred and fifty is expected.
In the party of the portfolio will reign a Christmas atmosphere, artists will also act and there will be a raffle of tombola.
The ANF Christmas cost 4,700,000 HUF and was held on Wednesday at the building of the National Council for the Administration of Justice (CNAJ) with musical concerts and dinner.
The rent of the hall cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers from one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party to be held by a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Comedy Theater.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, as we are unable to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The CNAJ building not only hosted the ANF party, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the Lucia Day dance on December 7.
Their CNAJ charged nothing for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the words of greeting of the minister and after dinner there was live dance music.
Answering [origo's] question they reported: to attend the ball it was not obligatory to wear a suit or evening dress.
Health, labour and local government portfolios are preparing for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a programme and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of HUF 400,000.
On the other hand, Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth is not waiting for her colleagues for an official Christmas holiday, but for a working meeting at the end of the year.
It has the participation of one hundred and eighty guests who - as reported by the press department - will drink only coffee and salty pastries, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The Minister for Local Government, Gordon Bajnai will instead simply toast with his colleagues in the classroom of the Ministry for Local Government and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own assembly hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget will be paid the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, the MF workers celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon schedule of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year reception on January 20, at the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle in the Municipal Park and according to the ministry, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple standing reception, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary, will be invited.
These annual receptions begin with a brief greeting speech by the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not hold any Christmas parties - this is what the relevant press departments communicated to [origo].
In the press department of the environment portfolio they could not report on the budget of the Christmas celebrations of the Ministry.
What is known is that for the party to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Unions and the National Federation of Workers' Commissions will set up a strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday's strike that will last indefinitely.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - the work stoppage will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, since rail traffic will be completely stopped and until 1 p.m. the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike.
On Friday afternoon the League Unions will report on the details of their strike on Monday that they will hold jointly with the National Federation of Workers' Commissions.
Likewise, the strike commission of the LIGA and the National Union of Machinists will be constituted, which will coordinate Monday's actions.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while participating unions will strike indefinitely on Monday if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not inform about the date of the end of the strike initiated.
If the National Assembly disapproves the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call to strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
Based on the National Assembly's Monday agenda, it is also possible that the public health law will only be voted on in the very late hours of the night, or perhaps close to midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: on the railways, work will be stopped indefinitely, in the morning a part of the collective transport in Budapest and more than half of the interurban bus transport of the Volán companies may stop.
At the same time, half of the roads will be closed in many parts of the country.
Numerous unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some unions announced their strike indefinitely, others for a definite time.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railway and the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement even on minimum services, although, as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are traveling on trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 1 p.m. the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will be on strike, those of Budapest Airport from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., the LIGA Unions of the Electricity and Thermal Energy Industry will hold a four-hour strike.  the Teachers' Unions called for a strike of 2 and the Democratic Union of Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors will go on national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Trade Union of Health and Social Sector Workers (SDTSSS), which is part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal for public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new way of calculating pensions that will come into force next year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, in the case of advanced pensions, the possibility that occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) which is part of the League Unions, does not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway lateral lines and expects a different proposal.
Political Capital: The risk increased in the country by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysing Division of Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed in August this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, has increased the political risk in Hungary and the region in several respects.
The company's "risk warning" writes: In relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the aggravation of ethnic tensions between Hungary's Roma and non-Roma population, violent ethnic clashes may occur even in the short term."
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of an event of this nature - added the representative of the research institute.
They stated that all this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life handed over the public debate on the Roma problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the existing discrepancies between Gypsies and Hungarians."
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international average, "significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country."
They remind us that: since the autumn of 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary received increasing publicity and impetus and that since the summer of 2007 numerous organizations have been formed in the country that define themselves as "associations of national self-defense".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is, the State" - they add.
They affirmed: all this occurs in accordance with the method that tries to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on society's discontent with politics and political parties.
For highlighting the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but is at the same time also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, numerous neighboring states have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while ultra-nationalist political figures from certain neighboring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard functions in a similar way to, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the mass riots of the gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the UNB decided to constitute the guard, arguing that the organization's goal is "national self-defense."
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there was "Roma terror" in Bulgaria, however the state remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls Political Capital.
They added: This initiative has provoked a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that certain Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced that in order to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Hungarian Roma will also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defence - it can be read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
Political Capital research director Attila Juhász told the news agency that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, every year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change in risk, they inform the public, as happened in this case, by publishing their warning about the risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers on the calendar and it has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - which next year will be less - the working days are reorganized.
Not even in the EU or North America are the holidays unitary.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national holidays, state holidays and public holidays.
The festive days are mainly related to religious festivals and historical anniversaries.
We celebrate the New Year too: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are holidays - the latter especially so that those who spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven holidays written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and October 23, commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20 we celebrate the founding of the State, on May 1 the labor holiday, on November 1 and 2 we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, in our country are two-day festivals Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often bridged when before or after the holiday there is only one working day.
In exchange for the weekends extended like this, during the previous Saturdays you can not be absent from work or school.
It is the minister of labor who regulates in his specific decree when you have to work exactly in exchange for the day directly before or after the party.
This legal norm is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not obligatory, however, for service companies and institutions which, due to their function, work uninterruptedly even during the festive days.
This year the order of work can only be altered around the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24 life in the country practically stops, since according to experiences, most people "make bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year several of our parties will coincide with mid or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First, the agenda around the labor festival will be modified so that then, for four successive days, the workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, so that in exchange Friday, May 2 will be a holiday.
The other change is related to the holiday of October 23: on Saturday, October 18, we will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the year that comes during the end of year party can be rested, since from December 24 you will not work almost anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little deterrents to sour the lives of your colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never receive, innocent lies that happen to us without realizing it: all of them are part of our daily Folklore at work.
You have to decide if you adapt to the small discomforts or consciously avoid confusing situations that can irritate others.
Councils.
$isculpa, I forgot to let you know that you have been sought out from the marketing department" - says one of your colleagues.
That's why you didn't go on a date?
In the best case you feel it and try to repair the matter, maybe call the marketing department to tell them that you forgot to deliver the message (this is the least usual solution).
Most of the time the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding to embarrassing explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can embitter the lives of your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that isn't yours?
There is nothing more irritating than when you want to pick up a document, an office supplies or your phone and do not find them.
Do you remember that yesterday you placed the stapler on the table, but for this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your lost pen on the table of one of your colleagues?
Don't take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they will rightly get mad at you for stealing their things.
Do not take envelopes or post-it notes from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they run out ahead of time.
Do you gossip about the private lives of your colleagues?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don't pass on to everyone the information (guesses) you have about the particular lives of your colleagues!
Don't abuse your colleague's trust when he shares his innermost secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, although others also know things about him.
Are you leaving sick leave unjustifiably?
When you phone the office and say that you are sick and your head hurts unbearably, you feel bad or good, you feel that day you prefer to rest; Think about how others must do your work, your tasks that cannot be postponed, your work by term.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something may happen to you, so you should stay at home, let them know, so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to confront your absence the next day.
Humming, giggling, phone calls
Are you involved in your work, but the laughter of your colleagues abruptly takes you out of it?
Have you involuntarily overheard a phone conversation that would have been better not to listen to?
Don't disturb your colleagues with your humming, singing, loud conversations (less when you do them above their head), kicking, constant profanity, expressing your discontent out loud.
All of these can be annoying, even if they are not delving into a project right now (writing, planning, organizing).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished something on time, forgot to send an important letter or message!
Do not allude to the chaos that eventually reigns in the office, or the noise that your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can repair your fault!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers - very comfortable habit for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Do not wear a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don't be messy, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing smart, elegant and beautiful everyday clothes when your occupation demands it!
You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car moves slowly in the usual morning jam.
A strange beat plays on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I turn up the volume.
It changes the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones the bass is added and then the voice of a female choir as a real jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
National music life didn't spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now this traffic jam seems totally different when you're listening to Zagar's new album.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs of the national digital underground are gradually changing the image and although garage style rock is fashionable again, it breaks guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are novelties under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer began his career in the city of Pécs, he played in the Yonderboi group until he began his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same group.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mixture of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, he tried to succeed, when he was asked for film soundtracks (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider audience knew the group that initially performed only in small clubs when the magazine wan2 selected its first album released in 2002 among the fifty most important national albums, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trendsetter, capable of selling also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his outfit are fashionable, but no one has asked them whether or not they gladly carry this label.
The ensemble reacted as it should: it prepared a new and even better album.
The newly released album, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
Well, this title was one of the lines of the old set of Balázs Zságer.
It is good the reference about the airy, about the flight, but in addition to the airy of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millenáris György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the ensemble The Puzzle.
The album includes a real hit of the channel mr2 Petõfi that lately transmits from morning to night popular music. This station brought to the ears of listeners the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers ($ivas Underground").
Well, everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: what are you performing, to what extent is it a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of a select audience means little to me.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; Not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from sincere inspiration.
Also the attitude of the listeners works in this spirit, regardless of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially in the west of us, light music has bigger traditions.
There not only the generations of fifteen and twenty years frequent the concerts, but also the oldest.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they're from, and how many people listen to your music?
B.Zs: Naturally I feel good to see that more and more people are attending our concerts.
But we have never composed music for the market.
We don't compose music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and made his career rather to the west of us.
B.Zs: We don't go his way, even though sometimes they try to compare our music with his.
We rather work as a team, trust in the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they compare our works with the music of Yonderboi, since many of us started our career in his group and from there we embarked on another path.
hvg.hu: On the mr2 chart Petõfi Wings of Love is in first place.
Many people first heard Zagar's name in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open with this style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't intend to write great hits and sell our album with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We added it at the end of the album, trying to relax after the sonic of the album and the heavier themes.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why precisely them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of the good-voiced soloists of our own national music scene.
This is how this six-woman choir was created - that is, Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - which was later baptized as Divas de Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you write exactly like that the song or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we had all the material on the album, we thought something was still missing.
The chord attracted singing.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
Everything came practically at the first attempt and incredibly spontaneously.
I remember, I was very excited then, but naturally I also needed the Divas.
With my voice it wouldn't have worked so strongly.
hvg.hu: Both at the concert and on the album it seems as if the girls are in the background.
There are no soloists (except for Judy Jay's brief solo), they have no role of their own, they sing all together and no louder than music, so music not only accompanies their songs.
Also on stage they are located in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
Instead, we consciously didn't want to distribute solo roles.
The song is also about it, about forgetting our ego for a while, that who has come from and where it goes, let those wings, the wings of love lift us.
I would have liked others to feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you do the most work to?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition there really were none, rather when it came to mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I am playing on a concert piano or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time the groove did not want to work and then, little by little everything was put in place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I have already "released" the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A Treacherous Stockbroker Risks Billions for His Inferiority Complex
A disloyal embezzler.
This is how he points to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the giant French banker of Société Générale, who also owns the Czech Bank of Commerce.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, without a doubt, with good capabilities.
Unlike all the big Czech banks, he sensed the crisis in the American mortgage market some time ago.
"He has a fragile character," he said from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel's answers according to what the French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, reveal is that he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1,600 million euros thanks to his businesses.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank," he says in his responses.
Precisely, in summer, he managed to earn during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
He already saw this opportunity coming at the beginning of the year.
In February, some news began to be heard about so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those customers would start to have problems.
However, this crisis was not to influence the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, its profits exceeded 1.6 billion euros.
"When I already earned my first 500 million I did not know how to notify it," confesses Kerviel and adds, that he has not left anything for himself, at all.
Throughout the interrogation, he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that his discovery would not be reached.
He even went so far as to deceive the bosses, even when the Eurex Stock Exchange became interested in his business.
Risk turned into profit
Were you afraid that it would be discovered?
Rather, no.
"I thought I had made $1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy."
Where did he get so much willpower to take such a risk?
In my position I had to work gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, exactly after finishing his studies in Lyon.
His annual salary was managed between 51,000 dollars.
Two years later he was already an assistant stockbroker and in 2005 he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of 90,000 dollars.
Still, I knew I was never going to win as much as everyone else.
"In my first interview in 2005 I already observed that they looked at me cautiously.
Because of my background and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described to the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to the shares of Allianz he won, during the bombings in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this was a starting mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we leave you
"This is like a snowball," police said.
But it is said that the chiefs knew about all this or rather suspected it.
"While I was making money, they closed their eyes."
Only, then came the blow earlier this year.
In one day he lost one billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to erase all traces.
When he arrived at work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5,000 million euros because of it.
And how did they manage to locate him?
He became suspicious from his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn't have a vacation is a runner who doesn't want anyone to take a look at his record," Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of raising 365 billion
Ministers of the government of the Czech Republic yesterday signed with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can obtain 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns).
This is almost half of the total sum that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately SEK 125 billion will be allocated to the regions from seven operational programmes.
Czech companies will be able to get around SEK 100 billion from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to $150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and accounts for up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructure that next year will have the amount of 90,800 million crowns.
The Business and Innovation program should serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organisational methods.
When it comes to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the least used countries of recent accession.
Twenty-year sentence for the former president of Nicaragua, the court decreed
Nicaragua's Court of Appeals on Thursday handed down a 20-year sentence for former Nicaraguan President Arnaldo Aleman, who was convicted in 2003 of embezzling $100 billion (nearly 1.8 billion kroner).
Despite this, some time later, he was released from prison to go to house arrest on his farm not far from the Nicaraguan metropili.
It is not at all clear at this time, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, will again be behind bars.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will be up to the prison officers whether to let Alemán finish his punishment at home or if they make him return to prison.
Four years ago, the court showed how Aleman constantly transferred government money to a company account in Panama.
This company was fictitious and the account actually belonged to his closest relatives and supporters.
Some of this money ended up in the fund Aleman created to finance his campaign in the 2001 elections.
This is how they approved the budget
That's right.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first drawn up by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not afford not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional but most influential hearing, calmly approved the new law.
It's a great paradox.
Every government begins and ends with every chapter and line of the budget, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics, but it hides the power rivalry between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore devotes special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State Budgets of the last governments of the Social Democrats suffered from three defects that for this year of 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of these is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as expenses of the leaders that are not only pensions but also social benefits that were already approved last year before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second of these is the deficit in the economy as a consequence of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, such as the municipal and community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not in the deficit of the State Budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money from taxes, fees and credits from banks, often issued, meaninglessly, obligations with which they disproportionately indebted their municipalities.
In recent years they managed to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks that they received from the state and privatization.
They do not currently have this resource.
If we stick only to the official and verified facts, we discover that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, went through phases of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, of which ČSSD boasts.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to put the state's finances in order.
Instead, however, the state continued to borrow.
The rest of the countries, except for some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to the nations that within the global measures are least threatened by poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes which, unfortunately, in recent years have uselessly been inflated by gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending approved this year before the elections, if the retirement age does not change soon and the pension reform then it will really be the end of any policy in this country and, whoever governs will only be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little we can say that the politicians who govern will become civil servants, mechanical distributors of most of the money from taxes for retirement and social benefits.
That is why this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of normal spending by presidents.
The planned deficit of more than $70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the last government had not squandered what they could in the last ten years.
We do not want the politicians who govern to become only civil servants, so we must be patient and grant this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to get from taxes and fees, the peace of mind for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will make possible the gradual achievement of a balanced State Budget.
Jiří Krejčí
Banks want to solve the crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the crisis of the Finance Market.
In the monetary marking, more than one hundred billion dollars will be received through tenders.
In these tenders the banks auction the interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will send forty billion dollars to tender, and then another twenty-four billion will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the attacks of September 11, it is the first time that central banks of different states agree on this coordinated process to protect and lessen the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, namely the continued growth of the shortage of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report to clients.
"This coordinated action by central banks likely slowed the recession in the United States from 65 percent to fifty percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent sixty billion dollars on unpaid loans, mostly in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
"Central banks must be really afraid of what still awaits them when they decided to take this step," said ABN Amro chief economist Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that they will have the same problems of access to loans and that they will therefore have to lend more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR tariff, London's interbank tariff used for the lending of money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money even as the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain cut their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another drop in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by central banks contributes to ignite the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the housing market in the US.
Klaus: The environmentalists' debates are incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus spoke again about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now arose with the closing of the UN international conference on climate change, in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he commented that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mixture of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
"The debates there are barely structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this topic is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, "many times I only encounter the caricature of my ideas."
Now those interested can find out about their varied opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, with the ability to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closing he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that on global warming there is no agreement among scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor do they represent possible disasters and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are futile,  ineffective and costly unacceptable.
In addition, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose untested opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
To questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he is not against "reasonable defenders of the environment but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits."
Klaus spoke about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driver's license
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the date and therefore failed to change their old driving license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request the change so that officials give them time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will find themselves on the roads without a valid license.
According to traffic, the license has not been changed mainly by those who no longer even want to drive.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decrease in the change of cards, the offices of the metropolis are full of applications and the interest in the new card has increased.
The City Council estimates around 2,000 customers per day.
In the queues you wait half an hour.
In Prague, around 140,000 drivers have not yet issued the new licence.
The issuance of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who must change their license and do not reach until the end of the year, but will go out on the roads without the valid license will risk a fine from January.
The offender shall pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The policeman can fix the infraction with a warning.
In case of an administrative offence the fine will amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, anyone who does not go anywhere could receive a fine.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 kroner.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to pay moderate fines of one thousand crowns, at most.
According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, fines of one thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driver's license is a document in which people can decide if they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who do not want to drive should hand over their driver's license.
Simply bring it or send it by registered mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the cards issued during the years 1964 and 1993 ceased to be valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually change the other types of driving license.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card that was issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more documents.
Court reduced sentence to Berdych's complicit detectives
The expolicias Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Prague High Court decided as the final expiry to reduce the sentences, the first to one year and the second to two years.
The detectives of the Prague department against organized crime were going to fall, at first, between 14 and 12 years.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also accused in this case, but the verdict of the Court of First Instance awaits him first.
Despite this, in other trials he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
You can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the involvement of 19 people in the robbery and the high court, today, overturned 16 of them.
Most of the accusations of the accused were rejected by the investigation because they were fabricated causes.
According to the Senate of Central Bohemia, members of the police in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered up robberies, and helped members of criminal groups avoid penalties.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their robbery to Opava and Koňařík.
The indictment relates to criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As far as the robbery is concerned, its victims suffered serious impacts on their health but they are also accused of the abuse of power as public agents and without a weapons permit.
In the house search, police found handguns, steel-core ammunition, a laser steer and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the indictment, stole tens of millions of kronor from them.
With the exception of nearly twenty men in this process, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men connected to Berdych's case are still testifying about other trials, and in some cases have yet to appear.
Tomáš Půt and Maroš Šulej, who have so far avoided trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await a final decision on their surrender to the Czech authorities.
One bill to change some children: 12 million
For changing some children in the maternity home, the lawyer for the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial from the hospital in Třebič.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the fathers, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital's legal representative, Ondřej Dostál does not agree in principle with Veleba's proposal.
"We do not approve such a demand, it is too high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"In order for us to get an idea of this counterproposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterpart ordered to investigate.
We will find out if it has a rescissory value.
We remain in the opinion that it will be hundreds of thousands for everyone," said Dostál.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each of the parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloň's family wanted, for every month they did not raise their biological daughter, one million crowns.
Velaba served as a basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist's report, only it was prepared at the hospital of the Motol faculty in Prague.
The parents of the girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychic impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stressful situation was better endured by the men although they fought with recriminations for the change of the girls.
Women are worse off with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with respect to what is happening today, Veleba added.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by nurses at the Třebič Maternity Home last year, on the ninth of December.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákový to Přibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloň.
At the end of October, the governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, gave each family 100,000 crowns as compensation expenses for the mistake made at the Třebič hospital that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must withdraw from the reserve fund and can extraordinarily ask the administrator for help.
The court until today awarded them a proportionally low compensation, the sums that were calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and ordinarily of one million crowns.
Polyvka lost the kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit over the Kingdom of Wallachia brand.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava it was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Wallachia but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka did not appear at the hearing today.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of Bolek Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Wallachia, everyone comes the image of the actor and comedian.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
"We have been working for about ten years.
Seeking money and inventing activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is in money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that I could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the Wallachian Kingdom trademark was first used by Polyvka in his television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
So it was not a question of orienting it towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
Some years later Harabiš came up with the idea of editing the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From that comical origin resulted a lucrative business and business activity from which Harabiš later created the society Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature on passports and even offered his owners discounts to visitors to his farm and attendees of his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on stage for his own business gain.
"It is clear that Bolek Polyvka helped the popularity of the Wallachian Kingdom," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team who were completely dedicated to it.
The collaboration, between the now broken parts, continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka the official coronation in Vsetín.
From that moment conflicts began to occur between Polívka and Harabiš whose culmination came with the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the chosen one forever".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabiš resulted in the singer Jarmila Šuláková, as queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed an accusation against Harabiš and his company that has so far been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, which Harabiš is already preparing.
From him should come the new king.
He did not want to reveal even more data or dates.
"We are in no hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's road to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can run," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices overcome
To tell the truth I have never liked the Peugeotu 206 too much.
Its running characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there is its successor, the Peugeot 207, on the market, and this one is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and for me, I can only think better.
When I tested the classic five-door Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the headboard space in the rear seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer before the two meters in length.
Flying around the world
I pass through the interior quickly so as not to repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would value more the invention of design although the car already seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained about short seats and backrests.
Also unlike the 206 model, the side steering has been greatly improved.
And the space?, and here you can feel how the measures of the body have grown.
In the Combi disappears the aforementioned shortage of space in the headboard.
Suitcases to the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is its trunk.
This I must value as very accessible (thanks to the folding tailgate) and a well-distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that are an ideal solution.
They do not disturb, and can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in basic regime it has a capacity of 428 liters which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the best-selling vehicle of the same type in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find that the Peugeot lags behind with its perceptible 52 liters.
On vacation abroad or when placing the child's stroller its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I must mention the floor that is quite flat after folding down the backrests of the second line.
120 horses in four gears
Our car test was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition over a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth this is how a 1600 should look like to look down on the familiar five-door.
It is silent, consumes little and above all, has momentum.
If I compare it to the time of the škoda of that time when it seemed as if the exhaust pipe was plugged by a rag, I can say that with this one I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, keep in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 for 329,900 crowns, you can still.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The Premium type tested already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbag at the headboards, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wipers, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything of everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It is a lot, but count on the complements of the team in the Fabia and will reach a fairly similar number.
Now it only remains to decide which of the two brands.
Slovak students do not integrate into English schools
English schools are attended by children from Eastern European countries and therefore locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now brings only a number of problems.
Even British schools register those cases where conflicts between migrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of integrating Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent, where conflicts between Slovak natives and emigrants are beginning to grow.
Arguments, torsion and quarrels between students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has gone so far that Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a green rod.
In his defense, he said the girl was insulting his son with racist insults.
The police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls treated him to racist insults and threw rocks at him.
"When we were going home, a boy came up to us at the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to leave him, he made the gesture of throwing apples and pears at us, and then he pulled down his pants and showed us his butt," the Slovak student's mother described another nasty incident to The Times.
The complaints are from both parties.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with Eastern European migrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases already mentioned above, show us how the atmosphere in English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Great Britain there are 70,000 registered Slovaks who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is truly the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be fulfilled, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, big waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Las Palmeras and the All Inclusive with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island does he find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Greater Antilles.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it, the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and loading port for the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and took to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional grew in the late 20s.
It was built by one of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything there was of criminality in the US (and therefore, prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba such as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana tall buildings emerged, along wide avenues ran cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a hacienda in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio left their signatures the stars of the world of entertainment and politicians from all over America.
And today?
On the walls of the Havana Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional they mix the cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cars already cult of the 50s, until today continue to work in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived long ago have rusted among these humid and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old quarter, is deteriorating significantly, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments in the surroundings as there.
Other places metamorphose into beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much necessary money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels grew not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world and that is highly valued by railway lovers.
Sugarcane is transported from the immense plantations to the sugar factories by narrow roads in steam or electric engines.
Its garages for dozens of years were not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose sister models that exist in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The place best known to most visitors does not change.
And therefore, it is not necessary to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the aforementioned Hemingway hacienda there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not miss it.
The Viñales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Lush vegetation growing on limestone lands.
Mogotes, pylons of limestone rock and rocks of high steep in the falls of the valley, and in its caves fertile lands are acclimatized thanks to which rocks are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is probably where the highest quality tobacco in Cuba is grown.
Visiting one of the Havana cigar factories you can find your final product.
Perhaps someone finds it interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was filmed there.
Trinity
City of old ancestry that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth turned to beauty with the constructions in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by French settlers who arrived later, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sierra de Escambray, is such a remote place that even in the 50s of the last century there was no road that linked it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore, nothing was destroyed, because each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than a single afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in the nearby surroundings such as Playa de Ancón or the valley of the sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
Small town in the extreme west of Cuba, some consider it to be the most beautiful on the island.
Surely that opinion is already confirmed by the way itself.
The two highways that reach there from Guantánamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as through a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (it is actually a cross that arrived 100 years after the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and that there is now a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the best known,  El Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the Isle of Pines, the Tropicana Cabaret, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre, Santería, African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, all of which could fill many pages.
However, as they say, better to see it sometime.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient necessary equipment is what is influencing the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to US Defense Minister Robert Gates, should devise a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not turning out as thought, agreed in Edinburgh (Scotland) the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement grow, today, the eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to become more active, Britain sees it as a priority to strengthen the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of development aid.
"The development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next step is to enable people to start economic and security development on their own," defence minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to US military data is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew compared to last year by 27 percent, and in Helmand province by up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have around 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, a quarter of whom are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the Allies have reached the same limit in terms of organization and equipment of the units.
They are exactly asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We're going to have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we'll achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke in a similar vein today.
"I'm not happy to know what we have on earth and in heaven in Afghanistan.
We have ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's little," De Hoop told Reuters at the close of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries attending in recent months there is controversy over whether all allies do their best in Afghanistan.
For passive, for example, Germany was criticized.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the demands of struggle there are not as high as in ours, in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The Sun tabloid newspaper this week called German soldiers lazy.
"The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in footage accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
Germany's Bild responded to the attack and posted a photograph of British troops playing a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The State debt will reach one trillion in 2009
For every Czech the state owes 84,000 kroner.
Total debt in September amounted to SEK 842.7 billion.
This year the government planned to lend itself 159.2 billion kronerV.
However, at the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner thanks to the improvement of the evolution of the economy of the state budget.
The Czech Republic's state debt grew at the end of September to SEK 842.7 billion.
In nine months this year it increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
However, since June it has decreased by 13.4 billion kroner.
So today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the state debt of early October.
For every Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
For the whole of last year the State borrowed more than 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems that thanks to next year's low deficit we could pass the trillion kroner border by 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900,000 million and one trillion crowns, "said for the iHNed.cz server, the economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
Next Finance economist Vladimír Pikora also sees it in a similar way: "We could pass the trillion during 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If the situation on the political scene were seen to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But I don't see such a change," he added.
Doubt grows
State debt creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
State debt is paid through treasury bonds, government bonds, direct credits or for example loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal indebtedness of the state grew this year from 38,500 million to 719,400 million crowns.
Foreign debt has so far grown from SEK 1.7 billion to SEK 123.3 billion.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion kroner z since June was reduced by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average maturity of government debt increased by 6.5 years.
"Total year-on-year debt from the first to the third quarters grew by 13 percent, which is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from bonds where there is a growth of 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand it shows that it is going to be negotiated until there is a pension reform, "said Pikora.
Better than expected
From the strategy of payments and management of the state debt for the year 2007 it is clear that the government planned to lend 159.2 billion kroner this year.
At the beginning of December, the ministry reduced the plan by SEK 152.8 billion thanks to improved state budget developments.
The amount is composed, above all, of the deficit of the state budget that this year will be 76 million crowns in vey of the expected 91,300 million crowns.
The remainder consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with about SEK 13.3 billion, the reserve of SEK 10 billion for pension payments, SEK 43 billion to finance state obligations and SEK 1.8 billion in payments on European Investment Bank loans.
He compared Khartoum in court today to have given a name to a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday afternoon by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and expulsion, her lawyer said.
The Briton was accused of letting pupils aged 6 to 7 give the name Mahomet to a teddy bear when any depiction of the prophet of Islam is unlawful.
He was subject to a penalty of lashes.
The 54-year-old British school teacher at Unity High School in Khartoum in Sudan was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with assault on Islam and sedition under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code following complaints from parents of pupils to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this 6/7-year-old teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the class's teddy bear.
"Eight names come out of the children's mouths, like Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after one vote in class, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following legend " My name is Mohamed ".
The bear he - himself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I'm sorry only that I asked the children to vote for a name", it is according to him only an " innocent mistake ".
Opinion divided by numerous students of the school teacher who describe her as " very attentive to her students " and " who never talks about religion in class ".
Recall that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child in a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we for example give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday, during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians ended a sixth and final session of discussions in Baden in Austria on Wednesday morning without being able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on status," European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger told a news conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was " at stake ", his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
"We do not foresee violence for now but we enter a very difficult period," he added, noting that " obvious tensions exist ".
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go one last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province populated by 90% Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was tasked with a new mediation by the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans believe their mediation will be completed on Dec. 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on a persecution of negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, Westerners consider independence under European Union supervision to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not rule in her favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," announced the president of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where these "last chance negotiations" had been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, has reported his sorrows.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade " belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations ".
" Domino Effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic has considered for his part that a compromise was always feasible, warning the Kosovo Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade says it particularly fears a " domino effect " in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia," he said, "this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision be exclusively the responsibility of the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a right of veto.
" The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word "
" Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia ", Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica had declared.
"These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council. "
To reporters, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on status ", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be made " in concert " with the Westerners.
Bush Starts Israeli-Palestinian Agreement
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference he met Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations in view of finding a final regulation of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must end its settlement activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations regarding the road map for peace they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would attempt "to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including the core issues."
This designation covers the three main thorny issues of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be "comprehensive and deepened" and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among other things."
Returning to the rostrum, Olmert pledged to make the upcoming negotiations "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008."
Bush set the end of 2008 for the end of the implementation of his " vision of two states " Palestinian and Israeli living side by side.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had secured an effort in this regard from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saoud said in his periodic Arab interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
As every time in this type of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car was driving on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., Luisa-Miguel Street, to Villiers-le-Bel.
"It was not in intervention but on patrol, and circulated at 40-50 km / h, without a rotating lighthouse ", explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, " not homologated, that is, not authorized to circulate on public roads " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated " at full throttle ".
"He hit the police car on the left side, after a failure to yield to the right," police said.
The breathalyzer test performed on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (the front part dismounted, windshield cracked, bumper torn) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the procurator of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for "acts of involuntary manslaughter and denial of help" to the IGPN, in collaboration with the departmental directorate of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor said that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed " the version of the policemen, namely that this minimotorcycle arrived relatively quickly to their left ".
Yesterday, a type of groove, no doubt caused by the rubbing of the footpegs on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been stuck long enough for the police car to brake.
The vehicles have been found and will be the subject of a technical survey.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated through Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the policemen had left the site very quickly, thus failing to help both young men.
The IGPN, this prudent principle, would also set aside " any serious fault " concerning this point.
"It is the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more investigations, on which you have to be very cautious," said a police source.
Liberation found an eyewitness to these few moments that have followed the accident.
One of its windows that precisely overlooks the scene.
"We went down right away, with my cousin who is a nurse to the hospital, to try to revive them," says this witness.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw " a completely terrified policeman, limping.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young men, the fourth was talking on the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, the certainty that the people present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen have been taken by car by colleagues who had been at the site.
Always according to this witness, the aid arrived " about twenty minutes after the march of the policemen ".
They also practiced cardiac massage, to no avail.
"I will not let it be assumed that the police services did not bring assistance to the young people.
These young people have been rescued.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday cracked down on the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, nearly 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against measures taken under the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter responded with stone shots, wounding policemen.
At least 350 lawyers have been questioned.
Similar scenes to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and injured lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations reportedly took place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
The lawyers' movement on Monday picked up the support of religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president "urged the population to send flowers to the judges who ruled against the state of emergency and the waste to which they took the oath in front of Musharraf."
" Musharraf's promise no longer fulfills "
The Pakistani Supreme Court is referring directly to the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to pronounce in the next few days on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election to the presidential elections on 6 October.
The president of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
"Everything we see is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court," the magistrate told The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf's pledge to step down as head of the army and become a civilian president "no longer valued" after the state of emergency was introduced, Assistant Information Minister Tariq Azeem told Monday.
He was expected to abandon his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The assistant minister of information also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country according to which President Musharraf had been assigned to residence by his deputy head of the armies.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unplanned
This estimate takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpectedly unexpected births.
Even today, more than one pregnancy in three (36%) is not planned, reveals a study carried out by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This estimate takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpectedly unexpected births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or sterilet still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates Ined.
The liberalization of contraception nevertheless allowed a better "mastery of fertility", according to the institute that notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 years is from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births out of ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated more or less a month for a couple in five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates on the International Space Station (ISS) more than seven hours of work in space to carry out the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel indispensable for the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky exit that accumulated the records because of its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "shattered" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when the astronauts had released from the Discovery shuttle the Harmony module, a thick cylindrical piece responsible for soon hosting European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a type of landing platform for module-laboratories.
But you have to be able to provide them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After having moved it, the crew began the reorganization of the module's solar panels that have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And it is where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, has been damaged by a little more or less than a meter by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment has been stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who had at first made a control sortie of the Discovery shuttle, and then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to snail at the end of the 30 meters long of the shuttle arm added to the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Tall, resistant, very skilled, has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this doctor by training has been in charge of "operating" the "injured" solar panel.
Having precisely inspected the damage, he severed the fallible cable and installed types of "slats" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second " spacewalker " who had stayed near the airlock and, from the interior, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped with insulator to prevent electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and "shabby" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was over, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before taking inventory of his instruments and returning to the interior of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a noon break before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle for the return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
EADS title sanctioned on the stock exchange
EADS shares are currently in sharp decline to the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defence group announced that it will have to spend between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion to deal with A400M delays.
EADS is currently losing 4% to €21.96 to the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to revise its forecast of the operating result for 2007 in response to delays engendered by the slow progression of the development of the A400M engine, which conditions the aircraft's maiden flight.
The cost to alleviate the delay taken in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion for Airbus," announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these burdens, EADS will be forced to announce new operating profit (EBIT) targets for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without any more precise precision.
The panel also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that EADS' operational result failed by 86% in 2006, mainly due to burdens linked to delays in another programme, the very thick carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
Choosing the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the polls: Russians will opt massively for President Putin's party, United Russia.
Confirming his aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days before the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today addresses to voters a televised message on public broadcasters, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as leader of the list for the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is proving overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president made nothing transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, content to deliver a new charge against the West accused of interference - his subject of predilection during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incident," he added.
According to the opposition, we are very far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign tainted by pressure.
Communist leader Gennady Ziouganov says that there has been " never had such dirty elections, even in the time of Eltsin ".
After the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, former checkweight world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, is banned visits according to his lawyer.
" The Russians kept the mentality of homo sovieticus "
Behind these legislative elections without surprise are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin to the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, on 2 March 2008; Candidates have until Dec. 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and elected again in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot seek a third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful United Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, in legislative and presidential elections, outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mentality of homo sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their destiny ", estimates sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
Historian Nikolaï Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes back further: civil society fell behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; The famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 90s, " Putin re-established the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic relief ", estimates Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " renounce of their own free will the personal responsibility " of whom they had briefly given evidence after the outbreak of the USSR.
" Why reflect? "
The phenomenon touches all social strata, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of every 85 heads of Russian regions) head the local lists of the united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 90s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name that the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old teacher: "Why reflect?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them? "
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are freely accessible.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were hitherto not consultable only for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is to say individually and by name, at the request of a former victim or his successors in title.
The eleven states in charge of managing it - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to seekers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Historians' access to Bad Arolsen will allow searches "particularly on the movements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of forced labourers," explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives run by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, were opposed to the opening to the public of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find the countrymen deported or subjected to compulsory work and, eventually, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to open the way to their compensation.
Still in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
" There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents, " Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Research on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität Berlin, had stated in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, bilateral Indo-European trade already reaches about 60 billion euros per year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The foreign ministers of the European Union had given their approval last April to the European Commission to start negotiations in order to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Indo-European bilateral trade already amounts to around 60 billion euros a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the European Union's 9th trading partner, according to European Commission figures.
" A free trade pact will greatly dope both economies " and " India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans ", justified Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, said the European commissioner. The Asian and European giants exchange annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "ten billion euros of services", Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, had declared this week, feeling that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its potential". The European Union and India meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering £10 billion in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was worried about easing the current reversal of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds to the base index of 5.75% in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight by the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to provide a significant proportion of its expected reserve intake during the maintenance period beginning December 6 in the form of an operation. of open market for five weeks," it said in a statement.
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, to the base index and until January 10.
It is the first time it seems that the English bank BoE puts liquidities on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it "is prepared to take further steps to keep the ratios" of interbank loans up to date in line with its base index.
The day's interbank index was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The index after three months settled at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the start of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England were combined with a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to certain rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the exchange rate of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more assured discretion.
The UMP and NC parties deny the examination of the PS party's proposals on purchasing power
The UMP group and Nouveau Centre on Thursday refused to discuss articles of the socialist proposed law on purchasing power, which amounts to a dismissal of the text.
Registered in a socialist "niche" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS among which the increase of 50% of the bonus for employment, the restoration of the TIPP (internal rate for oil products) floating, a transport check or rent restrictions.
Since UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles (180 voices against 115), the session was adjourned at the end of the general discussion that gave rise to exchanges, sometimes lively, between majority and opposition a few hours after Nicolas Sarkozy's televised speech on purchasing power.
PS MP leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
Following numerous rumors regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with British producer Melvin Benn's Festival Republic.
"For our company, it's an honor to work with a person who inspired, no less, the current festival movement in America," Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces Chicago's Lollapalooza festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival was to take place Aug. 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Once known under the name Mean Fiddler, Republic Festival director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took over the management of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organisation of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the " most inspiring event " he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn's are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
" We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and were working with perseverance with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we get stuck in low-level politics because of the current administration, Charlie Jones pursues.
" Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and prepared to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional location that, ultimately, will take place in Philadelphia. "
C3 Presents resurrected Lollapalooza in 2005 in Chicago's Grant Park, after standing out in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"Melvin Benn's European model is a country festival, while ours are more in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both an impression of a country festival in the European way and urban in the American way. "
Vineland is roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states " that they are quite interesting to allow investment in such an event and host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life. "
Charlie Jones says that the hotel offer of this festival is "very large", like the 80,000-person Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations have been extended to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going under press.
"Vineland will have the flavor of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 bandmates, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal:
Montreal stands up to Terminator
It's not easy to lure Hollywood movie dishes to Montreal when nothing but the Terminator is opposed to that...
This mission of seduction is part of the functions of the delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces runaway productions ".
Is it difficult to compete with the "Governator"?
"You have to be prudent, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that conditions in Montreal are favorable, you're going to go there.
Our role is to offer the ones that will judge the best," he says.
The race to festivals
At the moment, Denis Turcotte's priority is nevertheless the promotion of cinema here.
The race to the Oskars is begun.
All festivals on the West Coast, whether it's Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to feature Quebec films, give them value and make sure the filmmakers do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is in theaters in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also submitted four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? Experts divided by the 'subprime' crisis
With less than five weeks to go until the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional year-end rally.
However, this year experts are not so clear that this will occur.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock market usually has a positive behavior.
However, it is not advisable to make forecasts based exclusively on statistics, even more so because in the current context, uncertainties lurk in the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favor of the stock market taking off in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the flight effect towards quality values in both the long and short sections. "
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will have a rather lateral behavior, not exempt from volatility "especially because the impact of the likely reduction in the Fed's rates is not known, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions."
Javier Barrio, BPI's sales manager in Spain, agrees that this is not a good time to venture to say that there will be a rally.
"There is not the thing for many joys," says the expert.
The Ibex has lost about 4% since the highs marked on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Even so, not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year at this time.
However, the expert clarifies that things will be somewhat different this year since he believes that the rally will be brought forward to the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "therefore we could see a rebound in the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the US regarding the consequences of the crisis in the credit market".
The analyst is confident that these will be positive.
Analysts agree when choosing the values that will be responsible for taking the Ibex towards new maximum levels.
Solana, from Intermoney, affirms that "this year is the turn of great values".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some construction companies "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco assures that the increases will come from the hand of the banking and industrial sector.
The constructors will also be able to benefit from this rally, if it occurs.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technology companies will also do very well although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only twice has December been a bearish month.
The real year-end rally was experienced in 2003, a year in which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the bursting of the technological bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December registered a rebound of 6.68%.
It remains to be seen if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the moment the Ibex rises 8.36% since January) and if it manages to count on its year-end rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
In total 200, those located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group that decides to take the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20.30 in the afternoon, and open on Saturdays from 10 am to 8.30 pm.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that it wanted to extend the hours of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of the experience of Popular will be decisive for other entities to sign up or not to this initiative that supports the hours of the shops.
This is precisely the objective pursued by Popular with the project.
Attract private customers who move through these areas to make their purchases, SMEs, freelancers and shops in the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 branches open throughout Spain in about 18 months, since they are not new openings but remodeling of existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by customers in the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the hours is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The head of commercial banking, Ángel Rivera, assures that this restructuring does not suppose a great investment, although a greater hiring of personnel, since it goes from having about six employees per premises to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, according to Ángel Rivero.
The branches of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets in Madrid have been chosen, and it seems that with success, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the Mundocredit brand, specialized in immigrants, also with very wide hours, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax stores they will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of their branches have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
"We don't want to compete with our customers," Rivero says.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with external personnel to the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the stock market value of its rival Antena 3
We've done it.'
With that phrase yesterday expressed his satisfaction Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the close of the market, when he found that the chain he directs doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect tarnished his joy: 'it's what hurts me, it's not because we've grown more but because we've gone down less,' he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, "we've fallen less."
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an advance of 2.54%.
That gain puts its loss so far this year at 15.66%.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and owned by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday yielded 1.52% and accumulates a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed media companies amounts to €3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million Prisa (publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the fact that 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we monetize it in terms of audience."
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year the first television network to exceed 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
If this announced figure becomes true, the television network would register this year an increase of 3.6% in its advertising turnover compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, the net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (reaching 734.4 million) while net television revenues grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point out for the better relative evolution in the Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high payout that it has maintained until now: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that, although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its parent Mediaset.
"We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to leave our shareholders happy, to whom we have already given value with 33% of Endemol."
According to analysts, the market is showing signs of some fatigue at this time.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates for Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009, by 7%.
This is because, they explain, it has cut forecast revenue growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This same firm has lowered the profit forecast of Antena 3 by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 reviews
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both securities based mainly on their high dividend yield and sustainable long-term potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: sees Telecinco better (accumulate) than Antena 3 (maintain) for the 'attractive multiples' and rise of the business.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends underweighting in both cases by having 'similar threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of Mifid, which entered into force 1 November
Parallel to its parliamentary process, which ended today with the vote by Congress on the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim that both enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the effort made by deputies and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations in order to guarantee the protection of investors and regulate in detail the activity of entities so that markets function efficiently.
The Mifid, which modifies the Securities Market Law, involves the modernization of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the different supervisors of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow financial advisory services to be provided to both specialized firms and natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs), which join securities firms, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of transactions in financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are joined by multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with existing stock exchange managers.
The Law also obliges investment firms to disclose in the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and requires them to keep a record of all the operations they carry out, to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In its passage through the Congressional Economy Commission, several modifications were incorporated, among which it stands out that securitized debts are considered as a "complex" financial instrument given their high danger to the investor, which has been demonstrated with what happened with the debt of US subprime mortgages.
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics and Business can carry out 30 years after the royal decree that delimits the professional functions reserved for economists was approved in 1977.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work as an employee, will not require authorization from the CNMV and will be able to provide its services of marketing products and attracting clients to different investment companies at the same time.
The harmonised CPI increases five tenths in November, to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation index in the European Union, provides an advance of how prices evolved in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to offer data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The leading indicator is calculated using the same procedure as that used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the leading indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data, which will be released on December 14.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice president and Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, has affirmed that the rise in 4.1% of the CPI in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time has predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the halls of Congress that "although the figure is not good" the inflation differential of Spain with respect to the monetary union remains "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there has been less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high rise.
"We expected a figure of around 4%," acknowledged the Minister of Economy regarding the data advanced today.
Virgin plans to raise 42,000 million euros with Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen more than 50% to 12,000 million pounds (16,800 million euros) since it entered into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At that time it amassed record deposits above 25,000 million pounds, a figure that has fallen progressively in two and a half months due to the distrust of its customers and despite the guarantee of one hundred percent of that money offered by the Government and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the entity with its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenue in British banks that are deposited in the next three years to get those remaining 18,000 million pounds to reach the target of 30,000 million.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for its striking advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock this week named the bid of Virgin's consortium, in which three other companies participate, as its preferred choice to rescue it from bankruptcy.
Arrested the mayor of Totana for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (Popular Party) for his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the consistory and the chief of Police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and until then councilor of the municipality, and that according to sources of the investigation consulted by Cadena SER, could be the 'ringleader' of this plot.
The agents continue to register the municipal offices and the Ministry of Urban Planning and more arrests are not ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As reported yesterday by Cadena SER, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore forged, was arrested leaving Morales' home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban development agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, eight people are detained.
Bono agrees to lead the PSOE candidacy for Toledo and preside over the Congress if they win the
The former Minister of Defense José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE for Toledo for the next general elections and be president of the Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced at a press conference by the Secretary of Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting he held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best."
In addition, he pointed out that "it does seem" that the politician from La Mancha will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of Congress, who made public on November 15 his decision not to run in the next general elections and to abandon his career in active politics to dedicate himself to fighting climate change in the university environment.
The former minister has acknowledged that the president of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
In addition, he pointed out that, just as citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he takes office, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not insult or shouting." and make it "look more and more like citizens."
"Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can not speak calmly and calmly is the Congress, the president of the Government on one occasion was interrupted in the Senate 26 times."
Likewise, he has had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good work" and has not wanted to see himself already occupying his position so as not to fall into what, as he has pointed out, his adversaries could see as "arrogance".
Climate propaganda
Since the climate change movement subjects to merciless persecution both those skeptical of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is obliged to show an iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement who is president of the Government like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even intends to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This approach forces him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his government has contributed decisively to Spain leading the EU in breach of Kyoto.
Who are responsible for the breach, in what sectors it has occurred and why your Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it requires him to explain with maximum clarity to the Spaniards what measures he is going to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be affected, what citizen habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be obliged to make, what economic consequences it will have.
That is, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there have not been and will be no such explanations.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
Climate change measures, real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even the penny of gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous electorally to Zapatero that he has rushed to deny it.
In other words, it is about saving the planet with nothingness, with pure propaganda, with slogans empty of any real consequence.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With contracts with the planet, that man so useful for electoral campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is limited to being a merely virtual contracting party and does not pretend that we travel by bicycle or cool off with the fan.
Arrested the mayor and the head of the local police of Totana for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Council and a hotel entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation have reported today.
The mayor was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose dependencies he is currently with numerous agents, who have also gone to the Department of Urban Planning and the municipal company of management of Industrial Land and Housing.
These three arrests are added to the six made last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the reclassification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in developable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which instructs the Court number 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have been brought to justice today.
According to sources, the former councilor of Totana and today regional parliamentarian of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as well as the current girlfriend of the former councilor, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and businessman from Vigo Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, an agency integrated in the aforementioned Group, and through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, practiced eleven searches, most in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was then arrested in Totana, specifically, the owner of a well-known poultry products company in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was in charge of developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that were reclassified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate development; Conycase, which manages the Vigo car parks on Coruña, Venezuela streets and Fernando el Católico square; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; It recommends, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (by the way at the head of the PISA report on educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that the criticism of Blackburn's book appeared there:
"The content of the signature of Philosophy has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit of the deaths, a high school student, cited in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Minister of Education in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and affirmed that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes.

A colleague passes information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of offences on Internet downloads:
To. Downloading a song would be a crime with a penalty of six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal records worth less than 400 euros from the store, it is considered simply a fault (article 623.1).
B. If you steal from the store up to 1,000 euros, theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still lower than that imposed on unloading (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still lower than that of the discharge (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to engage in a fight than to engage in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous quarrel carries a penalty of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and the exchange would have a penalty of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Criminal Code).
And. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without the authorization of the authors is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Anyway, if my colleague is right, someone is losing his hand, a very long hand.

My GP gives me one of his articles on rare research entitled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of the workers depend on what the colleagues earn.
The study was conducted using tomographic MRIs at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Imaging group at the Life & Brain Institute, in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed."
The researchers observed that if when both were right they received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received double, the activation was higher.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Balkan prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has spent eight years relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals from the prosecution of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague.
Her term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bittersweet taste, because those most responsible for the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died - former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, remain at large.
Their names are on that list from which takes its title the documentary by Swiss filmmaker Marcel Schüpbach, 'Carla's List' (2006, not released in Spain) that, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the escaped criminals and pressure the governments involved to tighten the siege.
What insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver against possible accidents, involves an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, age of the license, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Having the car is only the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we must be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is materialized in an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of an accident.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the license, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use that is given to it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the greater the probability of suffering an accident, the higher the fee to be paid.
It is for this reason that both those over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that they have a lower accident rate due to their prudence.
Also, using the counts, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use that is given to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and with it in the probability of having some type of mishap.
Increasing the frequency increases the odds.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when establishing the price of the premium.
That is why the driver must study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will expose here the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 years of age encounter various drawbacks when taking out insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced driving experience and the age of the license.
Although the ideal to be well insured is comprehensive insurance, there are other cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for an all-risk with excess, so that they obtain the coverage of a comprehensive insurance but at a more feasible price.
This type of agreement would mean that the client pays a part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the claim contributed by the client will be pre-established based on the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," specifies Luis Noguera, head in Spain of First Europa, online insurance mediator.
Another option is an extended third-party insurance, so that the client ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, although not against those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered for theft, fire and the loss of the vehicle.
A piece of advice.
If you are under 25 years old, try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, and may reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate that the company has.
Conversely, a penalty is a surcharge on that base rate.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its benefit.
If the company has had a good year, it can afford to increase bonuses," says Noguera.
After the age of 25, drivers have it easier when it comes to taking out insurance, since the accident rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is best to hire an all-risk franchise.
"Normally young people can not make use of the experience previously acquired when it comes to fending for themselves in an accident, and even when driving," says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the rookie' has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is preferable that he negotiate comprehensive insurance, as long as his economic situation allows it, of course.
On the other hand, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest accident rate, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be a comprehensive one with excess (this can be 300 euros), or, when a high level of bonus is available, one to third parties extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"They carry out a more relaxed driving and have a greater purchasing power to afford to assume a greater amount of franchise," says Luis Noguera.
For retirees, it is advisable to have comprehensive insurance with a franchise (this being 150 euros), or an extended third party insurance when there is a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver against possible accidents, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that suits us best according to our personal situation.
Celtic seeks in Milan a point worth the knockout stages
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday at San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective objectives in the closing of the league of the 'Champions', since the Italians serve to be first and the Scots to sentence their classification.
The Italians have ten points and already certified on the fifth day their pass with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to ensure that Shakhtar, with six, and that receives Benfica, which has four, does not overtake him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the entire sixth day, as Milan has to play the Club World Cup in Japan, where it debuts on the 13th in the semifinals in search of a place for the final of the 16th.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the draw at the Giuseppe Meazza seems the most anticipated result, although the two teams will try to go for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would be first and ensure a better crossing in the eighth.
Gordon Strachan's team could even use a defeat to qualify if Shakhtar does not win, but it can not be trusted because at nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanists will try to sour the night to the Scots, who hope to get into the eighth round for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round last season with a goal from Kaka in extra time (1-0) after the 0-0 of the first leg.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be Shakhtar who is only worth the victory, in the event that Celtic loses, both to get into the eighth round and to continue in UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being last and without options to continue in the maximum European competition, could reach third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have kicked off in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since disbanding in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at GM Place stadium in Vancouver that the group's reunion is "brilliant".
Around 20,000 people sold out the concert that included a video telling the story of the group that was all the rage at the end of the 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects his main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', published in Spain by EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls took the stage wearing armbands that had been given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', the British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd that packed GM Place, despite the fact that Victoria's nerves had forbidden it days before.
In the run-up to the start of the show, Victoria Beckham said that the British star "hasn't seen our dressing room, not at all, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said of the group meeting she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have been fixed and we love each other very much."
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon arrival at the airport, an army of nannies awaited them.
Between the five they have seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), in San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid they will perform on December 23.
New gas fears between Russia and Ukraine
The growing gas price dispute between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it will affect Russia's export of the fuel to Western Europe.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is routed through Ukraine, so every friction between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit fees.
An earlier dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopoly owner of gas, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine was to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it will charge Ukraine more, which has pledged to pay an extra 50 percent in 2008 for gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say Ukraine could pay 40% more for Gazprom's imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
"Changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments about the levels of transit charges [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut off supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU's supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supply with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS 'will have to test foreign workers'
The Scottish NHS needs to check the criminal records of employees from outside Europe, a watchdog said.
Auditor General Robert Black's recommendation came after a foreign doctor was found to be linked to the Glasgow airport attack in June.
Black also expressed concern that NHS Scotland has no accurate idea of how many overseas staff it has.
However, his report pointed to other controls that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor general checked the number of foreign staff hired outside the European economic area, following the attacks on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at Paisley's Royal Alexandra Hospital, was arrested at the airport after crashing a jeep into the gates of the airport's terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who performed at the Old Bailey via video conference in October, charged in connection with the alleged car bombings in Britain.
NHS expects to carry out pre-employment checks on candidates, to ensure they meet qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish Board of Health uses Disclosure Scotland to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of Britain.
The auditor general's report recommends, among other measures, that boards should have guidance from the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although we found some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: "Our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available on the number of NHS overseas staff."
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "highly unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is not clear what the added value of the recommendations made is," he explained.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign nationals, most of them doctors and nurses
But the auditor general cautioned that the number may be higher, in part because boards have trouble identifying employees with indefinite residency permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures set up by NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being largely complied with.
This includes passport controls, work permit and qualification checks.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing the pre-employment policy and guidance for foreigners on the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was keenly interested in this work being carried out in the wake of the Glasgow airport terror attack.
He added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups - including overseas - which they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates at film awards
Control, the biopic about late Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including best film.
Trophies were also given to protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was cast in the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named best actress for the thriller "Notes from a Scandal."
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the variety award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in black and white - which features soundtracks by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only £3,000.
But also the winner was Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of U2's album Joshua Tree, winner of two awards - for best director and best debut director.
Rock music was the focus of another award at the ceremony — as Julien Temple's film about Clash frontman Joe Strummer won best documentary.
The award for best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a boss of the Russian mafia in London, in David Cronenberg's film Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hardball, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The fifties, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel "Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."
Winstone said he was proud to receive that award, named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter star Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harrris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was fortunate to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it's really an honor."
The independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa festival supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 militants from terrorist cells who were planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television from the world's largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil facility in Eastern province, the television report said.
Saudi Arabia created a 35,000-strong force to protect the Abqaiq facility, the world's largest oil plant, after a failed al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert" that has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned to smuggle eight shells into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning assassinations of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they must be more active in stopping Saudis traveling to Iraq to join as militants to al-Qaeda to fight allied forces and to back the Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the most extreme Saudi Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda militants are targeting many clerics in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants — recruited by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born al-Qaeda leader, to harass the country's pro-Western government — targeted government-associated foreign residences, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, for five months of work," the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
Those arrested also include a 16-person "media cell" in Medina, whose aim was to promote "takfiri thinking" — the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered infidels and apostates.
The arrest includes 32 other people accused of providing support and financial support to the militants.
Venus' Climate May Give Insight into Earth's Future
Venus may once have been an appropriate place for life, scientists declared yesterday.
Data from an orbiting European spacecraft showed the planet more like an Earth twin than previously observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth habitable, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus into a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead, and it is eroded by hurricane-force winds and lightning storms.
The results from the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, offer a glimpse of how Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from Earth's, when they are two planets so similar.
"Our new data make it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago."
Police seize "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, which they claim is enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman stated that three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million ($480,000).
Still open
Mitt Romney says it's not worthy for presidential candidates to answer a snowmonkey's questions.
But Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters videotape questions and submit them for dissemination among candidates.
None of the questions presented on the afternoon of Wednesday, Nov. 28, were more ridiculous than the snowmonkey who asked Democrats about global warming in the Republican Party YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican Party heading into next year's election.
It's not known exactly how CNN's producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose the YouTube videos to show the candidates as candidates.
But the first half-hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
The issue is one of the most potent topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to turn up the dial when they heard ideas they liked: Issuers noticed approval spikes when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The toughest exchanges of words of the night were between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a frontrunner in crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation because he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regularize their status and giving them the possibility of obtaining citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, reached agreement on the issue.
Neither has the word to be nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because both warned about the issue of immigration before the others.
At least on immigration, and broadly speaking, the candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance of illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with fears of toxic toys from China and other foreign concerns, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberal and conservative Christians.
But the debate became awkward when other topics surfaced.
Mr. Guiliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether immersion in water should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee — now, against all expectations, first in the latest Iowa poll, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism — said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pressed to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the election.
The race remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is on the rise in Iowa, coincidentally with liberal Ron Paul's fundraising campaigns and his heated statements from Wednesday's debate.
The two of them have come out from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole to sink into; but it also emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this one is not particularly interesting.
No influence seems to have been sold, nor are they exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor extramarital finger sucks.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to Britain's ruling Labour party, worth more than 650,000 pounds ($1.3 million), for about four years using false names, and that the party did not report it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence by declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that he would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with increasing wit, because the dreaded Mr. Brown has gone from being Stalin to being Mr. Bean.
The bailout of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poverty of judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have turned business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative botch.
A trio of retired generals started a mutiny in the House of Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: being ministers in the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now it's David Abrahams' multiple donations; Peter Watt, the Labour general secretary (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown walks irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach a tipping point after they find themselves unable to govern.
People don't believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch takes over.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve things, that he does not have much time left, that suspension is superfluous: civil servants begin to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press looks for bad news; And the government gets defensive and doesn't focus.
In one part, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
Although he wanted to disown Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the registration tax of authority are related to the decisions that Brown made as chancellor of the treasury.
And even when it's not directly involved in Blairis's mishaps — or "cash for partners," the investigation of political party financing — voters can assume that it is.
However, Mr. Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The gaffes are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor has he been directly scammed.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what the naturally Stalinist tendencies of Mr. Brown has always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to charitable gifts, says he doesn't want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision is not made by him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access from those in power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Watt's agreement. Abraham, and that this was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, head of fundraising who was asked about donations in October.
But Mr Brown is so far not implicated: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these proceedings, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the prime minister has done half the job.
He has been quick to condemn his party for breaking the law, but is diluted in decision-making over a family matter, a commission of inquiry into the matter — led, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law has been broken, it is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent, independent head for the Public Life Standards Commission, as he hasn't had one for six months, and he must push for genuine party finance reform.
This will require hard co-operative work by Labour with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation with the unions - bitter measures for a partisan like Mr Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; And the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and solid competence.
Shark cards
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural for dorsal fins to swim excitedly around.
Now that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their sights set on the country's credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis spreads other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already seen.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or that are more than 30 days late respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 million charge on its U.S. consumer finance business, in part because of weak card borrowers.
However, it is too early to panic.
Delinquency and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a ratings agency, the third-quarter crime rate of 3.89% was nearly one percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American bankruptcy law (2005) resulted in a sharp drop in bankruptcy filings, which in turn represent a large loss on credit cards; The number of applications (and therefore, delinquencies) would be growing again, or it may happen that conditions for borrowers were getting worse.
The industry also reports strong payment rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And confidence in credit cards and asset-backed securities is fairly firm, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that issuance volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of infection of the crisis between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge credit cards with debt now that lenders are expiring.
But credit card issuers look more at liquidity flow than active securities, so falling prices don't necessarily trigger a shift in borrowers' creditworthiness.
They can even work to outperform issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue paying off the mortgage decreases if the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; And as a result, paying off card debt goes up the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to difficult conditions than mortgage lenders by changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of a quick asset revaluation.
"We're not going to wake up one day and reassess all the loans," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's chief financial officer.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and a credit crunch pushes America into recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a harsher future.
You have to keep an eye on those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went on trial for their responsibility in the frauds with Enron's former finance chief, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found not guilty of seven counts of fraud for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish group PLC at the Royal Bank, became a notorious cause in Britain for the two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, his case marks the loose end of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were for alerting Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron's downfall.
The indictment against the bankers — dubbed the "NatWest Three" — alleges they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his previous top aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of a myriad of frauds at Enron, which helped its spiral into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary's interest at zero, but the three Britons knew that it would value upwards.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 in interest on the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million was left in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers collected $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two counts of conspiracy in the collapse of Enron.
The trio of Britons were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a sentence of 3 years and one month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million that they required to live in the United States while the trial was taking place.
Enron, one of the nation's seven largest companies, declared bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, couldn't hide the debt of millions or make its failing businesses look successful.
The collapse caused the loss of thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were charged with inmates last year for their roles in the company's collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly direct from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the wealthy Russians.
"It seats up to 18 passengers," says Gulfstream representative Dan Firer.
"But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it is for family private flights or for presidents of a company."
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire's Fair, a four-day of consumption held at an event center near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury suppliers had set up their exhibition stands, hoping to lure new wealthy Russians into everything from mahogany-coffered yachts to diamond-encrusted car grills worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks cautiously at a bright orange Porsche at the booth next to his."
"It's a beautiful car, but it's nickel and small change compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets."
Fueled by the oil boom, the Russian capital resembles Dallas when it was in full swing.
"We experienced the same thing in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialistic," says Marshall Goldman, a senior professor at Harvard University's Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.
"Like the Saudis of the '70s and the Japanese in the '90s, the Russians are emerging as the world's biggest consumers and spenders."
The world's most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their piece of the pie.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to brainstorm how to sell luxury goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think tank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians were below subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attends the fair for the first time together with the brand's Russian distributor, the Soho Jewelry group.
"The women are impeccably prepared and the men are very worthy."
Visiting the fair Sunday night, dressed in evening suits, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Yumatova, who reeled off the designer suit she wore as a red carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the nouveau riche, the kind of shoppers who would be willing to stay several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum feather cutters, ice cream from Mövenpick, custom pool tables, apartments in Dubai and teddy bears from Gund.
The general public can buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best," Mr. Simpson said. Gijrath, who sat patriotically on a stand of Dutch royal Delft porcelains, in front of a mural-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand-painted tiles.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in bling-bling."
In fact, sellers said wealthy Russians with more experience (10 to 15 years, by Russian standards) have changed their tastes from flashy logos to limited-edition brands, which wouldn't be on display at a trade show.
However, several thousand people: cash millionaires, millionaires' emissaries or tourists, fill the aisles every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, general manager of King Koil beds, said he sold two mattress systems worth $70,000 each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton interwoven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he had sold three chain-shaped car grilles for Rolls Royce Phantom for $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes encrusted with Swarovski-colored crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel. The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
The cost: $22,000 for a set of four.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels," says Mr. Karapetian.
"He's going to keep the car in his garage, along with 30 or 40 other cars."
Even if many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the surge in real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if you're not cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich because of the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British-style) phone booths filled with stacks of million-dollar counterfeit bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing officer, said his team had printed 500,000 counterfeits for the Millionaire's Fair.
Visitors stopped to shake piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their mobiles while resting on piles of money, or pocketing a couple of millions.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," Karryev says.
"Botched" Surgery Could Cause Death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the "A Little Healthier" restaurant and watched as an ambulance drove up White Cape Cod, two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car appeared.
And then another.
"Then I saw the ambulance coming up," Mr. S. said. Livingston, the restaurant's supervisor, that Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
Authorities learned the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Investigators are now trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by police but works at the home at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have yet to determine what caused Ms. Taylor's death. Arroyo, but wait for the toxicology test although the results will not be available until a few weeks. That will help solve the mysterious death grieving the upper ranks of the Newark policeman.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to Police Director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious," says Mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She protected me."
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and who left behind two sons, ages 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for County Union Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine if Ms. Arroyo died from an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one possibility," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said they arrived at the home around 3 p.m.
On November 21 and they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed and authorities have said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, named Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not say whether Ms. Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Mrs. Castro's home, where a withered rose bush sits at the front of the house, and a Dalmatian barks in the back.
A blue drum labeled "vanillin ethyl" — used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfume — was located on the garage door, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks to the side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when she arrived in Newark after 25 years with the NYPD, Ms. Arroyo was an invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its harsh political culture.
"She would say, 'You have to watch out for this or that,'" he said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when she wasn't.
It's embarrassing."
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates to lift the stock market
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the Federal Reserve to calm credit conditions with interest rate cuts, which were ratcheted up by reassuring comments from the vice president of the U.S. central bank.
Stock markets loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, the Fed's chief two number two, declared that policymakers must be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to continued financial market strain.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid growing samples of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said the recent turbulence was "partly reversed by the improvement in the market in late September and through October."
If the upward trend persists, it would increase the possibility of further adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and businesses, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the Fed is ready to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets. To make subsequent cuts in the interest rate, to stabilize credit conditions.
The remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy. In the U.S., home sales hit the record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were accentuated by a warning from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in an overall cost reduction to compensate for the losses of its investments in sub-prime mortgages in the US.
Only 20 of those positions are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, or 2.55%, to close at 13,289.40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of Britain's blue-chip companies.
Germany's Dax index rose 2.6%, and France's CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Earlier, the resurgence of credit tension in markets was highlighted after strong demand in a three-month fund auction by the European Central Bank, which considered such loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the actions of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and inject extra funds into the stock markets in London, strained credit and rates on three-month "Libor" loans among British banks, which meant the largest rise since September, of 6.59%, after a steady rise since November 12.
England takes with trial the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas here, each as difficult as the other.
Who should beat the No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the national team who is on loan – with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, director of England, is beginning to fill with offers to become a national selector, and if not, in a part time.
Failure to get sixth place in the bat will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and so is the sport.
It is not easy to throw away what one man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes due to lack of luck rather than ability.
Not only in cricket the choice is difficult, because it requires judgments that always end up being subjective.
Is it just the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another respect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good degrees and who know the business well, had been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who is to say what is a good level for a cricketer, unless he is given the chance to sink or swim at the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer has to catch the captain's eye at the same time as taking a wicket and a batsman to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to make an impact as a player one day.
But capturing the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who surely plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself for fit and bowls like the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races for each to earn a spot.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more from them.
Shah or Bopara games at Asgiriya Stadium may only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can break or make a man's career, or it can make a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every event and did well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, fighting to establish himself at the same time who became a player of importance, and despite scoring a hundred double against Australia in Australia,  It may still be underestimated.
The likelihood is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more discussion in today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah's greater experience over the young Bopara's exuberance.
There are arguments for both.
In Shah's favour is his brilliant and valuable debut test of early '88 in Bombay, 32 hundred first-class compared to only 6 for Bopara, who, at 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent antedecent against spin bowling.
But Shah scored only ten runs in his two at-bats in May against West Indias in the test at Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection from the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, he seemed to have taken from his batting something from him than in Bombay.
By contrast, the Essex team has joie de vivre on swords.
He catches up for nothing on the cricket ground and his attitude was summed up as when he overturned his car at an exhibition for England's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was pull out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was looking into the distance, to excitedly say, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is the best player, he is including his slippery pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, because he bats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Perhaps that is the true art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which is not to say that Shah does not stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, it is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work – and to the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses carrying Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling exiles who ran out of cash, without visa extensions and those hoping for the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and that it is safe now."
"They say Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to temporarily cease.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in their country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah phoned him to tell him that a U.S.-allied force was not being able to do so. The U.S. helped drive al-Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital, and urged it to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack, after he urged citizens to rise up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my colleagues."
"That's why I'm back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were attracted by the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops were in the capital. The U.S. will strengthen groups of "concerned citizens," armed and working cooperatively with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many said they had returned because of visa denial and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, gave voice to the common suspicion among exiles, that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, called on the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugees' visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of sectarian death gangs.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis, to force them back to Iraq," the Sunni said.
"I can't believe in a government that supports the criminals who torched my house after I left it."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been driven out of Shiite areas and vice versa, easing tension.
There are fears that a sudden wave of refugees will re-escalate sectarian tensions and start fighting.
Little Saarland, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines for the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sarlandese lack only one educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to a non-Sarlandis that we are not French" – that was the ironic motorcycle about themselves of the smallest federal state for its cenquantenary.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a great role in the education system of the Saarland that in a study of the Institute of German Economics (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" ranked fifth.
Thus, higher schools traditionally have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the Franzeses.
Until today students can finish their university career here with two or three dipolmas.
Consequently, the percentage of foreign students is high, at 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students from the Saarland is higher than the average in higher schools. Many of them do not have a bacillerato.
"In the Saarland, the vocational education system is being exploited," says Axel Plünnecke, the education sector expert at the Institute of German Economics (IW).
More than every five young people do their baccalaureate at the Professional School. Thus, it turns out that the Saar is 7 points above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, in relation to the number of population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and a growing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has fallen by a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Saarland Ministry of Education forced higher schools to make more publicity for the specialties in Engineering Sciences.
"After the first PISA study, we carried out some reforms in general education schools," says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative tests throughout the country.
In order for children to start studying as soon as possible in the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also imitates the other federal states.
Comparison with upcoming studies will show whether student performance has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of students lagging behind in school development decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
But, overall, the Saar did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
To the chagrin of the Sarlandians, the PISA report does not compare knowledge of foreign languages, even if they could achieve good results in this field.
Although the Sarlandese are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject in secondary schools.
Chavez changes the time.
Soon in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez allows the time to change in the South American country by delaying the clock by half an hour.
Chavez is currently becoming a comedian in Spain.
As reported by the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State, according to the new law, the time will pass to less than four hours GMT.
In this way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States imposed an obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chavez announced the rupture of relations with his neighboring country Colombia because of the action with hostage-taking.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until conservative Alvaro Uribe remained Colombia's president.
"My dignity does not allow me to do it," says Chavez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil-rich country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, his power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe to withdraw Chávez's mandate in negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas that involved the release of the hostages.
On Sunday, Chavez said Uribe's decision has offended Venezuela.
Also in Spain there is a lot of talk about Chavez.
A new ringtone causes a sensation in the country: "Why don't you shut up?", is the phrase that half a million people have already downloaded.
This phrase was pronounced by the King of Spain who was annoyed by the continuous interruptions by left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the decline in real wages threatens Germans.
According to one forecast, a decline in real wages threatens German employees this year despite a strong economic situation.
Experts present a plethora of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to the calculations of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real wage bill in 2007 than the previous year.
"The fault for this is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value-added tax and the growth in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Business Cycle Research told the newspaper "Bild".
New unemployment insurance charges may also accrue to employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the burden of unemployment insurance by 3.3% from one year to the next is fair and reasonable.
Naturally, the labour office does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and subsidies from the Federal State, in the words of a politician from the German Social Democratic Party.
On Tuesday it was made public that the inflation rate with the explosion of prices in the food sector and the oil products sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
When comparing prices with last year, they are increasing by 3%.
Venus: Earth's twin brother.
Although its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the planet most similar to Earth, something that until now had not been raised. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and eddies at the poles, the same ones that also appear in winter on Earth.
For three decades, researchers had suspected that there might be lightning on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightning strikes from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific journal "Nature".
According to Urey-Miller's famous origin-of-life model, lightning caused life on Earth: storms may have triggered reactions in the ocean that, in turn, would have given rise to the amino acids that are the building blocks of life.
On Venus it's not like that: if there were ever life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
Today, there can be no life on the surface of Venus: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times greater than on Earth and temperatures of 500°C reign on the surface, oscillating in such a way that temperatures below zero can be reached.
"Venus is possibly a 'diabolical' twin of Earth, but it's still a twin," Russell said.
The main goal of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth in mass and size, has evolved so differently.
As since the nineties there were no special missions, only for research of this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for the investigation of Venus.
The latest research results that will be presented in many "Nature" articles, according to the researchers, underscore not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighbouring planets have more common features with Earth than we had assumed," reports ESA.
Despite the well-known stormy winds at the North Pole, researchers discovered in the south polar region also a vortex formed by clouds that rotates faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the Earth's high atmospheric layers at the poles, according to a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet in the Solar System has the mass almost equal to Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost as large.
This planet also called an alba star or evening star orbits the Sun for almost 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day on Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and atmospheric pressure of 92 bars does not closely resemble Earth, scientists assume that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets water had agglomerated that on Earth remained in the oceans, but on Venus it dissociated in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties over the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, worries about Germany's reputation and so demanded that the grand coalition end this fight over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"In this case we should not present ourselves as ONE divided nation," Koehler told the Handelsblatt newspaper.
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding regarding the Dalai Lama's reception by Angela Merkel (Christian Democratic Union Party) in September.
"While I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in foreign policy, stresses the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach she received for carrying out a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional course of One China policy.
China knows that too," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Foreign Minister (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his displeasure at the Dalai Lama's reception and was attacked by the members of the Union because of it.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its ineffective policy in foreign affairs.
The Dalai Lama's reception at the Federal Chancellery caused great misunderstandings in Sino-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the Minister of Finance of Germany, but also, according to news sources of the magazine "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese Prime Minister, demanded that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians receiving the religious leader of Tibetans in their official position.
The Dalai Lama's actions and words showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that there will be riots like those that occurred in France.
Battles with the police in the streets, shootings, burning of cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that riots will occur as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that everything possible be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not spread to the streets.
Barricades were set, vandals shot rifles at police: after serious riots involving young people in France, the Federal Minister for Internal Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Christian Democratic Union Party) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We have to look ALSO that the social problems of our country do not take violent form."
"We have to take that seriously," he told the Hannover newspaper "Neue Presse."
Not all young people develop in the constant change of social reality.
The Federal State, federal states and municipalities are already working emphatically to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
That relates not only to the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Islam Conference: all this is already bearing its first fruits."
It is still early to take the end of the alarm for granted.
At the same time, Schaeuble pointed out that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The youths staged serious riots in the streets with the police north of Paris last night.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were also burned.
Kenan Kolat, the president of the Turkish Community in Germany demanded greater efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the unrest in France, warns of an imitative effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
In spite of everything, actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under 25 years of age is above the average.
Care must be taken to ensure that there are more vocational training posts.
Kolat stresses: "We have to give young people a perspective."
The president of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is a great social control in families", greater than the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, "But despite everything, we have to be careful."
We must "give young people the opportunity to receive a job or vocational training faster".
Meanwhile the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police took part in the action, a helicopter with headlights flew over the territory.
The authorities responsible reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burned cars.
Since the previous day a team of almost 1000 police officers is taking care of security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Home Affairs, announced that the police will take rigorous measures until necessary.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday around 80 police officers were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Toulouse.
The riot began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young men died.
According to information provided by the prosecutor's office, the death of the young men was not the fault of the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The action very far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition in terms of content reached its last point and that nothing more should be expected from it.
But in which country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate performance, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House, it must be said: she does not live in the country that should be governed by her.
As for the reproach that was made to her for having repeatedly devoted herself to foreign policy actions, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that this would be a parochial way and thus showed that he does not want to understand what interests critics.
In the Lower House, it was stated very clearly to everyone that this reproach was appropriate.
One could not feel the slightest interest, nor any kind of feeling for the problems of the country.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that flees in foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything concrete.
One example: climate change prevention: she praised herself very much for the decisions taken in Heiligendamm, but says nothing about how these climate goals should be realized here.
In general, this way of praising herself - for two years the head of the Christian Democratic Union Party has not been able to afford such modesty.
Well, he insists on expressions so that an impulse reaches the people.
And in this way he damages his public image by the pragmatic conception with which he solves problems without going through the branches.
But in Angela Wolke's reign, inner problems are appearances of little value.
Children's poverty and concerns for low-wage workers?
All he does is talk about it using subordinate sentences.
It's amazing how many times you get it wrong to speak up when it comes to the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good phrase.
He begins to stumble "as if it had been in uncharted territory," when it came to more concrete information.
The attacks section.
The two frontrunners, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, clashed in a heated debate of Republican presidential candidates on YouTube and must now fear only one candidate from the outside.
From the beginning, the tensions between the candidates were noticeable.
Mitt Romney reproached his adversary Rudy Giuliani for turning New York into "a place of refuge for illegal immigrants."
He, for his part, responded with serious reproaches: "I would like to say that his own house was a 'port' for illegals." Giuliani replies to the former governor of Massachusetts by saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to attack: since so far the group of Republicans does not have a clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their adversaries.
The small 30-second videos, shot by internet users that were sent to YouTube, also do not have much content.
"With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power," was John McCain's reproach to his adversary Ron Paul, the only one at the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives much criticism from veterans of the war in Vietnam, when he refuses to recognize as torture "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown simulate his death.
The reactions of the audience in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida show that in the meantime the most important issues of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates about torture.
The audience always applauded very loudly when they praised conservative values and denied the tax increase.
So you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney said, apologizing to people and television audiences for being an abortion advocate in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, didn't know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf rules without a uniform.
A day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
Thus ends the eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Thursday, Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's president, was sworn in for a second 5-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to uphold the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday he transferred his mandate as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after he seized power in a bloodless military coup, the former general rules the state for the first time as civilian chief.
With his resignation as head of the armed forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the west.
The other demand is an end to the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state prosecutor general, after the swearing-in Musharraf will soon annul the state of emergency and fulfill the second condition of the west.
Since the state of emergency was proclaimed in the Supreme Court, there have been many pro-Musharraf jurists. Last week the country's Supreme Court rejected all appeals ahead of the controversial new elections of the head of government on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded in one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock return.
The most famous German band of the 70s continues its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-release a copy of "Live 1974" was made which was written in the best period of the band.
Already in those times they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has in front of him his box, his cables and especially his buttons.
In the middle sits Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and dressed in a white shirt.
To his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking out of the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each one contributes with his sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
It seems that this does not bother the lords.
Something very exciting for Krautrock enthusiasts was the fact that the band Harmonia was making music again.
What needs to be revealed here is this: precise questions have shown that the band's name reverberated in people's minds, but it wasn't something so special that after 32 years the public missed it so much.
But why can't the Germans also applaud their living legend of the seventies?
Especially since the equivocal Kautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an "Echo" music award to the members of the band Can 2003 from Cologne for their life's work, the surprised faces of German pop artists could be seen in the hall.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, everyone opened their mouths in amazement.
Michael Rother later spent time on stage during Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance at home and recognition abroad are one.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed two years and in those times did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, it obtained it later thanks to the others.
Some time ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Later, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and later worked as a guitarist in the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at that time was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed the Cluster musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruin of the sixteenth century, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Comune I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was more of an artist's life full of surprises.
One day, an Ottenstein Harmonia singing association pennant reportedly appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages to using the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn't just about getting to know himself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Rother then expressed his desire to propel Harmonia and do occasional rehearsals.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up involved in esotericism and ensured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the eighties and since that time has been more successful than Harmonia had.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that is to thank Groenemeyer.
His music company Grienland set himself the goal of cultivating this German contribution of his own in order to preserve it as living music.
Like Roedelius' work, so too the band Neu! It was discovered again.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
Also present is Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all Krautrock's influences on the following pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super-band, a position that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, it splits the futuro".
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers on a farm.
The story of the development of the legend is shown in the black and white photo projections, where wired instruments are seen.
In the background are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing more than attach the microphones to the organ and drums in order to produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices they had built with their own hands.
Nowadays electronic music is as it had to be.
Three people who delve into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical environment you cough, whisper and in a good moment of emphasis you sing "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a term of English origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in the blues, but in the schools of music (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia remains calm.
On stage, we reflect very well on what is already evident.
Where does the music begin and end?
That can break one's nerves or give you a few quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again devoted to the war in the Balkans.
But the two were not very convinced.
Either the concepts are fixed a lot in actions and shots or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At the beginning there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the Balkan mountains, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
We had finally lost sight of the most handsome man of the eighties, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and unimportant roles in women's films and after many press conferences about Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important plot to see perhaps the movie "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why do movie titles have to be so long and crazy today?).
The film has a wonderful presentation to behold: at heart, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose better times of life have passed, who as a monument of the ruin of his decadence retained until now most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is the German production and will also be presented this week, turn out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
You can narrate the film "Moerderischer Frieden" in a few words: it is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very fast and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The sense of the film is lost by the actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not once again presented as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm fuer Cobra 11" without a motorway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because there was never really a good movie about the war in the Balkans.
At another point, with another director and with another screenwriter (Richard Shepard in two charges), the story about American reporters in the war who leave to detect a Serb war criminal named "fox", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army cannot do and each time it is a crazy trip.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when we are introduced at the beginning to Simon Hunt, who is not allowed to be simply a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also foresees an affair with a Muslim Bosnian woman who is going to kill later.
So "The Hunting Party" is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with impressive speed achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the headhunters of the world could not achieve for five years, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Bosnian Muslims to take revenge in a fair way.
It's so bad, that it makes you want to appeal to the international court in La Hague based on the crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in reality, a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and stresses that the Americans and the French are not really worried about persecuting them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so that a very famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
In this peoma it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing the feelings with him, how hard it is to be bad".
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem lies not only in the genre of war films in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper it published that all films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
It's almost always worth a rule: when a star gets into a crisis region or minefields, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "Across All Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio appears.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
It will take at least decades for Hollywood to make a good film about the Holocaust with the movie "Schindler's List" as an example.
Some movies already need more time. Classics such as the works about the war in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their times were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our times every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that's because screenwriters don't have the slightest qualms (which is necessary to be able to) telling good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" turned out to be so good in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you don't have to be a good person to shoot a movie.
Perhaps you have to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look of an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That's just because some things never change."
Big cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly killed and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives the negative criticism of the Olympic Games as a response.
The mayor of Hamburg received much criticism from politics and economics for not soliciting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust reminds us to be realistic when estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director general of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, on Wednesday called the resignation "not good for the economic location."
In recent times, no other project in the big city has fostered as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective, the political, sporting momentum could not be maintained at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded that the Senate not forget this project, but find a new long-term application "that refers to another time."
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust stood by his statements that Hamburg's ambitions in hosting the Summer Olympics would not be realized until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but it is decided by the German Olympic Sports Federation," says von Beust in WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December, on Munich's application for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
"This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we would have until 2028, realistically we will not have any chance."
Still, this dream didn't end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It is too early to let the opportunity be taken away, if at the moment the plans are ruined," Günter Ploß, the director of HSB, said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the request is contradictory to the statement made by the head of the Senate at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public Sports Federation of Higher Schools (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's application for the 2015 Universiade not as "a replacement" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Higher Schools Sports Federation named Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The Fraction of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) reproached the Senate for not taking advantage of the valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate was behind with the development of the small neighborhood of Grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympics or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded integrated planning of Olympia for little Grasbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At the time, Hamburg's application for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Whoever relates the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but does not think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Today the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on the list of Warhol's works.
Most of the ninety-four "type" Gloss-Box on this list are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" put the doubt about the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968 by Andy Warhol, the Moderna Museet museum in Stockholm conducted internal investigations and reached disappointing conclusions: the six "Shine-Boxes", which the former director of the museum Pontus Hultén gave to the Moderna Museet museum, are fake, and almost a hundred of the others of "Stockholm type",  that are in circulation in the international art market, they turn out too.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and patronized productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted the wooden boxes red, blue and white, with the same sample that had cartons of soap powder "Brillo".
According to Warhol, hundreds of glitter-cardboard boxes were exhibited at the 1968 exhibition of his 1968 works at the Musée Moderna Museet. These were not made by Warhol (because of the expense), but were brought directly from the cardboard factory of "Brillo".
These were not works of art, but specimens (which were only objects) exhibited.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed the production in Sweden of a glitter-wooden boxes, but they were not exhibited in the Modern Museum.
Witnesses of those times now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auction as originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of "Stockholm type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
At auctions some of them were bought for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the museum Pontus Hultén made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Sultan and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had already died for 3 years.
Lars Byström, the chief curator of the Moderna Museet, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three privately owned by the Swedish that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First their tight silvers were printed and frosted and then painted in oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of the year 1990 shows that the paint was applied with a roller without directly printing the tight silvers. In addition, it is not about oil painting, but about acrylic paint.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from Andy Warhol's official Brightness-Boxes list," says Lars Nittve, the director of the Moderna Museet museum, adding that if the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Commission in New York will not come to some conclusion, the Moderna Museet museum will classify these six boxes as the copies/exhibits."
Already in July the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "serious accusations" in that they are boxes of soap powder.
But from that moment everything there remained in absolute silence.
Rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had barricaded themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered.
Ringleader Antonio Trillanes, who reproaches the president for corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter he could not answer for bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government had stormed the hotel using tear gas.
Almost two hundred soldiers had been barricading themselves in the building for a few hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, were on trial Thursday for attempting a coup in 2003 that ended in failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, to suddenly be able to deposit with about 30 supporters.
Evidently the military policemen who were supposed to watch him had passed into his ranks and continued his mutiny.
They entered the "Peninsula" hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blockaded the neighborhood around the Hotel Noble.
The president called for an urgent session of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the national security adviser, condemned the soldiers' behavior.
"People are fed up," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join our ranks."
Gen. Danilo Lim, who formerly commanded the elite Scout Reangers, said the other military troops soon wanted to keep going.
The government's main critics called for a large demonstration against the president on Thursday.
For months his government has been reproached for corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention for the mutiny that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 in the Philippines there have been at least seven coup attempts against the democratically elected government.
United Internet will be Versatel's largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday the company reported that the average price for a share is 14.46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There was much speculation about the takeover of the company.
There are also options to further increase the financial part in Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) market.
On Wednesday they already made assumptions about entry into the business, after Brendenberg bank increased its stake to the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market that means that the financial institution holds the equity securities for a third party partner.
United Internet already in the previous day involved with almost 10 percent to the telecommunications company Drillisch.
Drillisch in the measure of capital increase placed 17.4 million of the new shares that have a value of 106.4 million euros.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares of them for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies started negotiations on marketing cooperation for DSL-products.
"We strengthen our collaboration," explained the United Internet voice player.
The two companies founded a joint MSP company to acquire competitor Freenet.
On Thursday, United Internet reported that initially, the two companies want to be happy with the ten percent stake in Freenet and do not make use of their right, that is, they involve 18.49 percent of Freenet.
That meant that both companies kept all options, most notably the participation in the Freenet joint-stock company.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
Until now, the holding company of United Internet and Drillisch directly held 6.01 percent of the stake in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch will achieve the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
