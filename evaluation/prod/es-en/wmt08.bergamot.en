European inflation slipped on food
Accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is due first to the dizzying growth in the price of food products.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 eurozone countries, registering - after 2.6 percent in October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - the Luxembourg-based Office for Union Statistics announced.
Official forecasts only gave 3 percent as likely, the Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike US, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the core interest, on the pretext that the decline, along with rising commodity prices and the reduction in forced unemployment, would cause a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least about two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "we must negotiate" on inflation so that it does not have to intervene on this issue later.
3.3 percent inflation, recorded in Germany, broke the 12-year record, while in Spain it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation skyrocketed in the eurozone as a result of galloping food and energy prices.
Wheat quotations increased by 88 per cent and the quotation of soybeans also reached its highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market rose this year by 52 percent, reaching black gold by almost $100 a barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from the current 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent, while by 2009 it will fall to 1.9 percent.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain around 3 per cent in the next 3 to 4 months, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to cut interest rates twice during the 2008 year.
Gallup foresees a government crisis
After a long stalemate, support from the Young Democrat Alliance rose significantly by early December, peaking since 2002, while the Gallup never experienced such a low level - 13 percent - in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of secure party voters - due to the greater firmness of opposition voters - would mean support of more than two-thirds (71 per cent) against the support of a fifth for the Socialists (20 per cent).
According to the poll, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach the limit necessary to have any parliamentary escano: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the voters are one percent more of supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even from the previous low point - it has never been so high, 41 percent the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation particularly bad, while another 46 percent believe the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As far as the next year is concerned, the majority of the population has the deterioration of the situation and only one tenth expects an improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of those consulted, higher than any previous Gallup poll, estimated that the President of the Government is rather bad but well.
Thirteen percent of those consulted trust or trust Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of those consulted.
54 percent of the population does not trust the head of government at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of shaping the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced with the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year, 35 per cent felt that it would be desirable to keep the Government and the head of government in power, this proportion is currently only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) believe that the only solution is to hold new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the question about participation answered that they would surely participate and another 20 percent said they are likely to participate.
By comparison, in "a general election to be held this Sunday" would surely participate only 55 percent of the population and another 15 percent believe their participation is likely. Based on the current intentions of the voters, there is no doubt about the outcome of the popular consultation.
74 per cent of the population would disapprove of the payment of the fees for study, 79 per cent that of the medical consultation service and 84 per cent that of hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of the fees for study, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, Tesco has quintupled its prices
The average price level increase of 16 per cent had the hypermarkets of the Budars commercial gold triangle, with the difference that VAT has not been increased this year.
Article of Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the commercial golden triangle of Budars the usual Christmas basket of the newspaper Napi, but in all hypermarkets there was a much higher growth of a thousand HUF.
As prices in supermarkets had already been "shoot" in December last year, this did not see a drastic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously terrifying for consumers that what the past year could have been bought at a price well below nine thousand HUF, today they cannot do even for ten thousand.
The basket of Napi in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest basket was 10 573 HUF.
(in the 2003 year that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous anus, but there was a sharp increase in turkey breast fillet, walnut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed data from the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in the Auchan we have also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than HUF 200.
Equally surprising in this store that the price of Coca-Cola with a two-litre redeemable bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in the basket of Napi Auchan it was the most expensive, while Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, compared to Christmas prices in the past year, Cora rose by 15, while Tesco and Auchan with about 18 percent the prices in the Napi basket.
Comparing the values of the most expensive basket of the past year with that of the cheapest basket of this year, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between the cheapest of the past year and the most expensive of this year has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
The average price growth was 1206 HUF last year, so during Christmas the last year in prices felt the increase in VAT.
Precisely this process was the one that shattered the trade, supermarkets were visibly unable to make decisions on the price margin to apply for each product and to calculate the effect of the price change on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of a product's circulation, it may lose a significant profit in the margin that fits the sales volume.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, which the most expensive was higher with 1720 HUF to the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year did not produce such extremes, as the highest price for now has been 1630 HUF more than the past year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two whales seasons, there was catastrophic price growth in prices in less than 20 months, hypermarkets grew by more than 30 percent the price of basic consumer goods.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some basic necessities, recorded in the 12-month range a price increase of more than 30 per cent.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to the Napi basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already the year passed compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst case only 10 percent price increases.
According to all indexes, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, and can impose the drastic increase in prices even on multinationals.
Hypermarkets don't complain about the commercial golden triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experiences, most consumers in the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, taking the preserved foods by pallets.
In the morning on Wednesday, the three stores formed large queues ahead of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that within the country the sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to the survey institutes because the income falls below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of appliances.
In many hospitals you save with disinfectants
This anus has been recorded in hospitals several thousand infections caused first by the improper application of antibiotics.
Hygiene circumstances in hospitals, overcrowding of beds and staff overload do not favor infection control - says the department doctor of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many hospitals it saves even with disinfectants.
Not long ago, a contagion with MRSA has been diagnosed in the trauma department of the Hospital János.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion occurred in this same hospital early in the year.
A wounded man from a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient had to return to the hospital as a result of the MRSA contagion and since then no major surgical intervention has been performed due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
As of December 10 of this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection caused by multi-resistible agents have been registered in the Nosocomialis Surveillance System of the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, said, a medical officer-CED of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that hospitals have surely recorded this number of infections produced by multi-resistant agents, of the rest no information is available.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
A third of humans carry the bacterium of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in their nose without causing any disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. inflammation of the throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once it is over-exaggeratedly or improperly applied to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics, become highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria and quickly spread in inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, such as infections of wounds or septicaemia in the first place to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with the weakened body, to the elderly or to low-weight people.
According to the doctor-director of János Hospital there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, the MRSA is only absent, said Tibor Nyulasi, where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotic resistant
"These patients are isolated, nursing staff care for them in rubber gloves and masks and there are the right antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are previously examined to check the presence of MRSA in their body, but this cannot even prevent infection in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples.
It would be possible to prevent hospital infections of MRSA in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances do not favor the prevention of training and contagion with multiresist pathogens - says Karolina B.r.cz.
Because this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate the sick who carry MRSA in their body.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not finance these medical examinations.
So most cases come to light when MRSA infections are already visible in the patient, said the doctor-scar department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes rigorous tasks for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological pictures.
It is necessary to insist that antibiotic therapy be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be done to prevent resistance to medicines, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less frequent in the case of street patients or in basic care - said Karolina B.r.cz.
It saves with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is infected from one patient to another through health personnel.
Therefore, the washing of the hands, the use of rubber gloves and masks are a very important role, however also in this sense there are considerable faults in hospitals.
MRSA is infected by transmission by droplets and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital wards are often crowded, beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated for at least a distance of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, it can also be experienced - added Karolina B.r.cz - that in hospitals of less favourable economic situation it is saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and that is why there is a greater probability for the infection.
In the opinion of Karolina B.r.cz, where appropriate preventive measures are met, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the contagion of the pathogen may be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
The treatment of contagion with MRSA is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so in all countries it is being fought.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
The programme appears to be successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative alcohol control of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the police commander of the XXII district has been made.
The possibility of driving drunk or in a stunned state of the then resigned police commander of the XXII district, who on Tuesday ran over and caused the death of a passerby - Attila Morvai, spokesman for the capital's attorney general, said Friday after the expert report on the case was prepared.
The expert report confirmed the outcome of the primary alcohol control which had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcohol drink before getting behind the wheel.
The then head of the police station in the XXII district, on Tuesday with his private vehicle as he bent Kossuth Lajos Street in the XXII district, ran over a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the designated pedestrian area.
(This last fact, that is, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Transit Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give way when he bends.)
The passer-by lost his life after being hospitalized.
From what happened, the district police leader resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is carried out by the Budapest Investigative Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also said the former police commander from the outset worked with the prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
400 million euros more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed on Friday in Budapest three credit-limit agreements worth a total of 400 million euros to finance education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a budget of EUR 300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget projects for transport and environmental protection projects, which will be carried out from the grant of cohesion funds, of which the parties had previously signed a credit agreement worth 100 million, the contract they have just signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The credit contract of EUR 150 million is also allocated to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this objective of Hungary, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million, the decision will be taken at a later date, when the credit agreement is extended.
The parties signed a contract for 50 million euros for innovations, which the budget will mainly be used for the innovation and research project of the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the issue of the construction of the 4th Metro line.
The agreement was reached that by the time Hungary finalizes with the EU the details of Metro's funding, they will again address the issue that whether or not the original contract is necessary and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest of the appropriations is in line with EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charging a fee for keeping the credit available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed towards that Balkan country shortly mentioned.
What, where and those buying in the EU's even cheaper market, which will be quickly increased?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred goal for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments on the ski slopes and beach chalets.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the beaches Albena, the "Costa Dorada," the "Costa del Sol," the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for buildings in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy real estate in the particularly cheap Rus area.
Likewise, the capital Sofia can be attractive, commercial and office spaces promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of Europe's most attractive golf paradises, and this may be a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
So cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example around Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their lives and their way of life.
Most of the customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and there are traditionally many Russian customers on Black Sea beaches and ski paradise.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renovate them later.
They demand good communication and access, in addition to them is important the proximity of a large city, the shops and usually a local doctor.
Buyers of chalets are the second category (Bulgaria in December was included in the top 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group is the real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital's properties is steadily growing, as demand is increasing.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, in the last five years they suffered a 21 percent annual increase
Rising property prices significantly exceed wage growth.
Fodor and the six for hundreds of Hungarians
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, the meetings at the expert level will be concluded on Tuesday and on Wednesday after the official inauguration negotiations on the international climate regime will continue after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world deliberate on the Bali Road Map available to the post-mission reduction period efforts, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
Encouraging discussions are currently under way on the issue between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that at the moment it does not want to negotiate on precise figures, although it tends to agree that compared to the 1990 situation, until 2020, the emission of greenhouse gases will decrease by 25 to 40 percent.
Another major theme of the conference is that whether or not industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to offer material and technological assistance to countries in need.
Agreement was also reached on aid to be offered to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member board of directors, probably within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF)," writes the "Piac és Profit."
Six for hundreds of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to preserve its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister said the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent to the 1990 level, whether or not the "post-2012 agreement" will be signed and is prepared to decline by up to 30 per cent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in accordance with their responsibility and capabilities.
Galbor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed themselves to a reduction by 5.2 per cent, among which the then 15 EU Member States committed themselves to achieving an 8 per cent decrease.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce with 6 per cent the emission of gases responsible for the greenhouse effect from 1985 to 87, which our country will fulfil - the press release of the Ministry of the Environment is quoted as saying.
Much is at stake in Balí, since in two years the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed until after 2012. In this case the reduction commitments made in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system, the need for which was warned in its most recent report by the IPCC, the international UN scientific association dealing with climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
With this, the reduction of emissions would be delayed and could not prevent an increase of more than 2oC in the Earth's average temperature, a fact that scientists say would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
British army recruits on YouTube
British army units in a video dealer post recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) was the one that took advantage of YouTube services: special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in Kandahar's general operating body, then sent to London to be charged to the internet.
The political message is inevitable
There are already 139 recordings of air force soldiers who have been loaded this way to the Internet and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "prosecutor headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Ministry of the Community of British Nations (Commonwealth Office) and multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had uploaded the videos with recruitment targets, but in the Ministry of Defence's view they also serve to present to the public the real target of the British army's presence abroad.
This type of propaganda costs practically nothing compared to conventional television stations of recruitment - he told the BBC the defence expert Gordon Mackenzie - instead, they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the raison d'etre of the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans set up a video game
The army also cares about the fact that, in addition to the renowned and censored recordings, the distributor also features amateur videos, for example about the death of soldiers: in the propaganda film "official," a little hypocritical, the officers speak at the maximum of losses, without presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, numerous videos recorded in actual operations have been uploaded from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army is only recently seizing this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different way for recruiting with free downloadable shooting video games called America's Army, where in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can get right instead of the soldiers.
Tombola and salty cake at the ministries' Christmas party
Labor Minister Mónika Lamperth doesn't seem too sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to fire the year with salty cake and coffee.
There is ministry that will celebrate its party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with tombola and toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - that's how power is fun.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defence, but not for Ministry workers.
At Christmas of the Orphans will receive gifts from the fallen soldiers and for Christmas the families of the soldiers who are currently carrying out missions abroad are invited to the Christmas. A reception for the press will also be offered.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the festive atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will hold a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The feast of the MET will be celebrated in the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4 320 000 HUF and of the six hundred workers of the ministry, approximately three hundred and fifty are expected to be present.
At the portfolio party there will reign a Christmas atmosphere, artists will also perform and there will be a draw of tombola.
ANF Christmas cost 4 700 000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the National Board of Directors of Justice (CNAJ) building with musical concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost a million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers from one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party that will hold a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for the Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Comedy Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, as we failed to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The CNAJ building not only hosted the ANF party, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of Lucia Day on December 7.
The CNAJ of them did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister's words of greeting and after dinner there was live dance music.
Answering the [origo] question they said: to attend the dance it was not mandatory to wear suit or evening dress.
Health, work and local government portfolios are preparing for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400 000 HUF.
Instead, Labor Minister Mónika Lamperth is not waiting for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for an end-of-year work meeting.
There is the participation of a hundred and eighty guests who - as reported by the press department - will take only coffee and salted cake, so the party will not cost more than HUF 350 000.
Local government minister Gordon Bajnai will instead simply provide with his colleagues in the Ministry's classroom for local government and land.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own event hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - this budget will be paid for the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, the MF workers all year old celebrate Christmas in the same way.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also because of the afternoon hours of its celebration.
The agricultural portfolio will offer a New Year's reception on January 20, the Ministry will not be held Christmas.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle in the Municipal Park and, according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - is going to be a very simple standing reception, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary, will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief speech of greeting from the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not hold any Christmas holidays - this is what the relevant press departments told [origo].
In the press department of the environment portfolio they were unable to report on the budget of the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the party to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts, more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Workers' Commissions will set up a strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday's strike that will last for an indefinite period.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - will begin work.
This action will surely cause major transport difficulties, as rail traffic will be stopped completely and until 1 p.m. the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike.
On Friday afternoon, the League Trade Unions will report on the details of their strike on Monday that they will hold in conjunction with the National Federation of Workers' Commissions.
The strike commission of the LIGA and the National Union of Machinists will also be set up to coordinate Monday's actions.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday the participating unions will go on strike indefinitely, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call for strike action.
Instead, if the law is passed, strike committees will meet and decide on the future.
Based on Monday's agenda of the National Assembly, it is also possible that a vote on the public health law will only be voted on in the very early hours of the night, or at best near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: on the railways it will stop working indefinitely, on the morning a part of Budapest's collective transport and more than half of the intercity bus transport of the Volán companies will stop.
Simultaneously, in many parts of the country there will be closure of half of the roads.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some unions announced their strike indefinitely, others for a definite time.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railway and the Free Railway Workers Union (SLTF) were unable to reach an agreement even on the minimum services, although, as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people travel on the trains are approaching.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 1 p.m. will be on strike, the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company, those of Budapest Airport from 7 to 9 a.m. on the morning, will hold a four-hour strike from the LIGA of the Electrical Industry and Thermal Energy, the Educator Unions called for a strike of 2 and the Democratic Union of Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will act on a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (SDTSSS), which are part of the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is for the government to withdraw its proposal for public health reform and subject a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of pension calculation that will come into force next year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, in the case of advanced pensions the possibility that the occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) which is part of the League Trade Unions, does not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway side lines and expects another different proposal.
Political Capital: Risk Increases in the Country by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysing Division) of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, constituted in August of this year with the support of the Better Hungary Movement, from several points of view the political risk of Hungary and the region has increased.
The "risk warning" of the company is written: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the aggravation of ethnic tensions between the gypsy and non-gypsy population of Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic clashes may occur."
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of an event of this character - added the representative of the research institute.
They stated that all this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave the public debate on the gypsy problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the discrepancies between Gypsies and Hungarians."
This exacerbates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflict - they estimate.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international average, "significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country."
They remind us that: since the 2006 oton, the reorganization of the radical and far-right groups in Hungary received increasing publicity and encouragement and that since the summer of 2007 numerous organizations have been formed in the country that self-describes "national self-defence associations" have been formed in the country.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is, of the State," they add.
They stated: all this occurs in accordance with the method that seeks to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and with political parties.
Assuming the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations, it serves not only to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but is also at the same time a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, in many neighbouring states they referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard operates in a similar way than, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian Guard is due to the massive riots of the Gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to establish the guard, arguing that the objective of the organization is "national self-defence."
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there was "Gypsy Terror" in Bulgaria, however the state remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - Political Capital recalls.
They added: "This initiative has provoked a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that some gypsy organizations in Bulgaria have announced that to resist, they will be their own guard.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that Hungarian Gypsies also react to the threat in a similar way, by organizing their own self-defense - can be read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
Political Capital's director of research, Attila Juhász, told the news agency's question: "The risk analysis is one of the research institute's activities.
As he said, each year publishes their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence risk change, they inform the public, as happened in this case, by posting their warning about the risks.
The party isn't always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - that the next year will be less - the working days are reorganized.
Even in the EU or in North America, the holidays are not united.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national holiday, state holiday and holidays.
The festive days are mainly related to religious feasts and historical ephemerides.
Let's celebrate the New Year too: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive - the latter above all so that those who spent having spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and October 23, a day commemorating the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, we celebrated the founding of the State, on May 1st of the work party, on 1 and 2 November we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, in our country, the Easter of Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas are two-day feasts.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often bridged when before or after the party there is only one working day.
In exchange for weekends elongated like this, on previous Saturdays you cannot be absent from work or school.
He is the Minister of Labour who regulates in his specific decree when we have to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or after the party.
This legal rule is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory for companies and service institutions that, due to their role, work uninterruptedly even during the festive days.
This year the order of work can be altered only around the festivals of the end of the year: from December 24 life in the country practically stops, since according to the experiences, most people "make bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their vacation during these days.
The next one several of our holidays will coincide with mid-to-weekly, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First the agenda around the work party will be changed so that then, for four successive days, the workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, so that in return Friday 2 May it will be a holiday.
The other change relates to the feast of October 23: Saturday, October 18, we will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the anus that comes during the end-of-year party can be rested, since from December 24 there will be no work on almost anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six pets deterrents to bitter your colleagues' lives
Emails we forget to send, sound messages we never receive, innocent lies that happen to us without realizing it: all of them are part of our daily Folklore" at work.
You have to decide whether you adapt to the little discomfort or consciously avoid the confusing situations that can irritate others.
Tips.
"I forgot to tell you that you've been looking for the marketing department," says one of your colleagues."
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best he feels it and tries to fix the matter, maybe he calls the marketing department to tell them he forgot to deliver the message (this is the least common solution).
Most of the time the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding to embarrassing explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can bitter the lives of your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that isn't yours?
There's nothing more irritating than when you want to get a document, a useful office or your phone and you can't find them.
Remember that yesterday you placed the stapler on the table, but for this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your pen lost on the table of one of your colleagues?
Don't take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they'll rightly be angry with you for taking their stuff away.
Don't take envelopes or post-it from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and run out before time.
You're kidding about your colleagues' private lives?
There's no good solution to stop rumors already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don't give everyone the information (conjectures) you have about your colleagues' particular life.
Don't abuse your colleague's trust when he shares his closest secrets with you.
Bury in yourself what you have heard and don't gossip about your colleague in his absence, even if others know the things about him.
You're leaving for sick leave unreasonably?
When you phone the office and say you're sick and your head hurts unbearably, you feel bad or well, you feel that day you prefer to rest; think that others should do your job, your tasks undelayable, your work by term.
Don't screw up your colleague.
If you already know in advance that the next day you won't go to the office or something can happen to you, so you must stay at home, please contact them, so that your colleagues or your boss don't have to face you missing the next day.
Tarareos, giggles, phone calls
You're in your job, but they abruptly get the kidneys of your colleagues out of it?
Have you involuntarily heard a phone conversation that would have been better not to hear it?
Don't bother your colleagues with your hummings, songs, conversations aloud (less when you do them above your head), kicks, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontent out loud.
All of these can be annoying, even if they are not delving into a project at the moment (writing, planning, organization).
You blame others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you're not finished in time, you've forgotten to send an important letter or a message.
Don't allude to the chaos eventually in the office, or the noise your colleagues make.
You must recognize if you've made a mistake that harms others and you have to fix the fault.
Ask how you can fix your fault.
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers: very comfortable room for the house, but it's not suitable for the office.
Don't see a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows.
Don't be unraveled, respect your colleagues and yourself wearing everyday, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation so requires.
You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car moves slowly in the usual morning traffic jam.
Sounds like an extra compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I upload the volume.
It changes the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones the bass is added and then the voice of a female choir as a true jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays Zagar's song Wings of Love.
National musical life didn't spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it seems completely different this jam when you're listening to Zagar's new album.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs from the national digital underground are gradually changing the image and although again the rock garage style is fashionable, it breaks guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are novelties under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer began his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi ensemble until he began his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to succeed, when asked for cinematic soundtracks (pl.
Ferenc T.r.k Szezon).
The wider audience knew the ensemble that initially performed only in small clubs when the magazine wan2 selected its first album released in 2002 among the fifty most important national albums, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend trainer, able to sell also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his ensemble are fashionable, but no one has asked them if they are wearing this label.
The set reacted as it should react: it set a new album and even better.
The newly released album, titled Cannot Walk Fly Cande It may open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the ancient ensemble of Balázs Zságer.
The reference to the angry, about the flight, but in addition to the angry thing about music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds louder, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millenáris Gysrgy Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the set The Puzzle.
The album includes a real success of the channel mr2 Petáfi that lately broadcasts from the morning to the night popular music. This station took to the ears of the radios the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers ($Atunderground).
Well, everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success, the question arises: the one you are playing, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of select audience for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But a good pop song can also emerge from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of listeners also works in this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign public?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially to the west of us, light music has bigger traditions.
There not only the generations of fifteen and twenty years attend the concerts, but also the oldest.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are from and how many people listen to your music?
B.Zs: Naturally I feel good to see that more and more people attend our concerts.
But we've never composed music for the market.
We don't compose music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and made his career rather west of us.
B.Zs: We don't go on his way, even though sometimes they try to compare our music to his.
We rather work as a team, we trust each other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they will compare our works with Yonderboi's music, as many of us began our career in their group and from there we took another path.
hvg.hu: On the list of hits of mr2 Pet-fi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people first heard Zagar's name in relation to this song.
Did you consciously open this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't mean to compose great hits and sell our album with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We added it to the end of the album, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the album and the heaviest songs.
hvg.hu: How have you selected the six singers?
Why exactly to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of the good-voicing soloists from our own national musical setting.
This created that choir of six women - that is Seine, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik-Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who was later baptized as Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you exactly compare the song or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material on the album, we thought something is still missing.
The chord attracted the singing.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
Everything came to practically the first attempt and incredibly spontaneously.
I remember, I was very excited then, but naturally I needed the Divas as well.
With my voice it wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both at the concert and on the album it seems as if the girls are in the background.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay's brief solos), they don't have their own role, they sing all together and no more strongly than music, so music not only suits their songs.
Also on stage are located in the background.
- Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are deep down simply because of technical problems.
Instead we consciously didn't want to distribute solo roles.
The song also deals with it, about us forgeting for a while our ego, which is where it came from and where it goes, let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have wanted to get others to feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you do the most work to?
Zs.B.: In musical composition actually to none, rather when it came to mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I am playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time the groove didn't want to work and then, little by little everything took place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I have already "untiled" the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
Treacherous stockbroker risks billions for its inferiority complex
An embezzling disloyal.
This is how he points to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banker giant of Société Générale, also owner of the Czech Trade Bank.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
Rather, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, no doubt, with good capabilities.
He long ago intuited, unlike all the big Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" was heard from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel's responses according to what the French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, shuffle is that he was a man who at the end of last year made a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros thanks to his businesses.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank," he says in his answers.
Precisely, in summer, he managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity has already seen her come earlier this year.
In February, some news began to be heard about the so-called subprime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those customers would start to have problems.
However, this crisis should not influence the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded 1.6 billion euros.
"When I already won my first 500 million I didn't know how to notify him," Kerviel confesses, adding, that he has left nothing for himself at all.
Throughout the interrogation he stated that he had falsified the searches in such a way that their discovery would not be reached.
He even fooled the bosses, even though the Eurex Stock Exchange began to be interested in their business.
Risk became a profit
Were you afraid you'd find out?
Not more.
"I thought I had earned $1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy."
Where did you get so much willpower to risk that way?
In my position, work was to be done gradually.
He went to work at Société Générale in 2000, exactly after finishing studying in Lyon.
His annual salary was handled at between $51,000.
Two years later he was already a broker assistant on the Stock Exchange and in 2005 became a stockbroker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still, I knew I was never going to win as much as everyone else.
"In my first interview in 2005 I already observed that they were watching me cautiously.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described to the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first big success.
Thanks to Allianz's shares, he won, during the London bombings, playing a title of 500 million euros.
And this was a starter mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we leave you
"This is like a snowball," police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew about all this or rather suspected it.
"As I made money, they closed their eyes."
Only then came the coup earlier this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to erase all traces.
When he got to work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did they get to track him down?
He became a suspect from his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn't have a vacation is a runner who doesn't want anyone to take a look at his record," Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has the possibility to get 365 billion
The ministers of the government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can obtain 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion kronor).
This is practically half the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion kronor will be out of seven operational programmes for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion kronor from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to $150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of operational programmes and accounts for up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state transport infrastructure fund, which next year will have the amount of 90.8 billion kronor.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should secure funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organisational methods.
As far as the current use of EU funds is concerned, the Czech Republic is among the newly admitted countries that use them least.
Twenty-year sentence for the former president of Nicaragua, the court decreed
On Thursday, the Nicaraguan Court of Appeal decreed the 20-year sentence for the former president of the country, Arnaldo Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of the embezzlement of $100 billion (almost 1.8 billion kronor).
Despite this, a time later, he was released from prison to be placed under house arrest on his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metropili.
It is not at all clear at the moment, according to the AP agency that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002 is behind bars again.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will depend rather on the prison agents if they let Alemán finish their punishment at home or if they make him return to prison.
Four years ago, the court showed how German constantly transferred government money to a company account in Pánama.
This society was fictitious and the account actually belonged to its closest family members and supporters.
Some of this money ended up in the fund Alemán created to fund his campaign in the 2001 elections.
That's how they approved the budget.
Yes, it is.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first prepared by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget has already been approved with the support of SSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and "SSD" could not afford not to accept it.
Aside from different debates before the vote on the government's vote of confidence, this time nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional sight although the most influential, approved the new law calmly.
It's a great paradox.
Every government starts and ends with every chapter and budget item, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but hides the power rivalry between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore devote special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than the simple numbers.
The State Budgets of the last Social Democrat governments suffered from three defects that by this year 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first is the high participation of the mandatory laws, called as of the expenses of the presidents that are not only pensions but also the social benefits that already last year were approved before the elections by the "silence" coalition of SSD and KS-M.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not in the deficit of the State Budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money from banks' taxes, fees and credits, often issued meaningless, obligations to which they disproportionately indebted their municipalities.
In recent years they managed to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks they received from the state and privatization.
They do not currently have this resource.
If we stick to only the official and verified facts, we discover that:
Our economy, a few years ago, goes through phases of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, of what "SSD" boasts.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to put order for the state's finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to be indebted.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to nations that within global measures we are less threatened by poverty.
That is why it is not necessary to mass social programmes, which, unfortunately, in recent years have been uselessly swelled with gigantic measures.
And while they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending passed this year before the election, if the retirement age doesn't soon change and pension reform then it will really be the end of any policy in this country and, governing whoever rules it will only be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little bit we can say that the politicians who govern will become civil servants, mechanical dealers of most of the money from superannuation taxes and social benefits.
That is why this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of normal spending on the presidents' expenses.
The planned deficit of more than $70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the past government had not wasted what they could.
We wouldn't want the politicians who govern to become just civil servants so we should be patient and grant this weak coalition of government, who realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to get from taxes and fees, the tranquility for preparing other law reforms.
This alone will make it possible to gradually achieve a balanced State Budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Bank of the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
In the Monetary Marking, more than $100 billion will be received through tendering.
In these tenders, banks auction the interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will send to bid $4 trillion, and then another $24 billion will be provided by Europe's and Swiss's central banks.
After the 9/11 attacks, it is the first time central banks from different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, that is, the continued growth of the free capital shortage that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report for clients.
"This coordinated central bank action probably reduced the recession in the United States from 65 percent to fifty percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
"The central banks must really be afraid of what is waiting for them even when they decided to take this step," said ABN Amro chief economist Kieran Davies.
"It seems the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that they will have the same problems of access to loans and that they will therefore have to lend more dearly to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the global economy.
The central banks so decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, an interbank rate that is used for the loan of money in the interbank market.
This means banks were constantly afraid to lend money even as the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another interest rate fall," Greg Salvaggio of the company Tempus Consulting told Reuters news agency.
Some economists are no wonder that the step taken by central banks helps to ignite the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Environmentalists' debates are incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again expressed himself on the problem of global warming.
Criticism now came with the closing of the UN international climate change conference in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Azúl, not a green planet, he commented that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only to the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
"The debates are barely structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because as he said "many times I only find the caricature of my ideas."
Stakeholders can now learn about their various opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, sufficient assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, able to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experiences with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main time of the closure, he expressed his thinking that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement on global warming between scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so large and serious, nor do they represent possible disasters and that attempts to influence climate development are useless, ineffective and costlyly unacceptable.
In addition, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels like a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
To questions from those present he repeatedly explained that he is not against "reasonable environmental defenders but against environmental militants who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits."
Klaus spoke about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people failed to change their driver's license
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the date and therefore failed to change their old driver's license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for the change for officials to give them time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after the new Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads without the valid card.
According to traffic, the card has not been changed mainly by those who don't even want to drive anymore.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in the change of cards, the metropolis offices are full of requests and interest in the new card has increased.
The City Council estimates about 2,000 clients a day.
The queues are expected for a half hour.
In Prague, around 140,000 drivers have not yet been released.
The issue of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issue of the card within five days.
But in that case the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who must change their card and do not reach until the end of the year, but will go on the roads without the valid card will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand kronor.
The cop can arrange the infraction with a reprimand.
If an administrative offence is a fine shall be 2,500 kronor.
According to the above information, a person who is not going nowhere could be fined.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 kronor.
The Ministry appealed to the offices for moderately entering fines of a thousand kronor, at most.
According to the member of the transport ministry, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand kronor do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driver's license is a document in which people can decide whether or not they want to.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who don't want to drive should hand over the driver's license.
Just bring it or mail it to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the cards issued during 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually change the other types of driver's license.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card that was issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more documents.
Court reduced sentence to Berdych's complicit detectives
Ex-polices Josef Opava and Petr Koa'ík on charges of complicity with criminal David Berdych are going to spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Prague High Court decided as a final expiry the reduction of sentences, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The detectives of the departmental government against organized crime were originally going to fall, at first, between 14 and 12.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also in this case charged but he is awaiting the verdict of the Court of First Instance in the first place.
Despite this in other proceedings, he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court acknowledged the involvement in the robbery of 19 people and the high court today overturned 16 of them.
Most of the defendants' charges were rejected by the investigation because they were fabricated cases.
According to the Central Bohemia Senate, members of the police in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered up the thefts, and helped members of the criminal group avoid punishment.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Koa-ík.
The indictment concerns criminal acts committed by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As far as theft is concerned, their victims suffered serious health impacts but are also charged with the abuse of power as public agents and without permission for weapons.
In the house search, police found guns, ammunition with a steel core, a laser leader and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the prosecution, stole tens of millions of kronor.
With the exception of nearly twenty men in this trial, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men involved in the Berdych case are still testifying to other prosecutions, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomá P.t and Maro-Eulej, who have for now avoided trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
An account to change some children: 12 million
For changing some children in the maternity home, the lawyer for the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants the hospital of Tébia 12 million kronor for compensation plus the expenses of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for fathers, two million, and for children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondej Dostál, does not agree in principle with Veleba's proposal.
"Such demand we don't approve it, it's too high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"In order for us to get an idea of this counter-proposal, we need the specialist's report that the counterpart ordered to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a reasonable value.
We remain in the opinion that it will be hundreds of thousands for everyone," Dostál said.
The amount should be moved between 100,000 and 200,000 kronor for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, Jablo's family wanted, for every month they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba served as a basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist's report, only that it was prepared at the Motol faculty hospital in Prague.
The parents of the girls, according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry, suffered from mental impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better endured by men although they struggled with recriminations for girls' change.
Women wear it worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with regard to what happens today, Veleba concluded.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by nurses at the maternity home of T.ebia the year spent December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Emákova to Pibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Bro. and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablo.
The governor of Vysoina, Milo Vystroil, delivered 100,000 kronor to each family at the end of October as compensation costs for the error made in the hospital in T.ebia, which the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must be extracted from the reserve fund and may extraordinarily ask the administrator for help.
The court has so far granted them proportionally low compensation, the sums calculated according to tables that count in the hundreds of thousands and strictly one million kronor.
Poliívka lost the kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit over the brand Kingdom of Valaquia.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Valaquia but the project was created for many years by Tomá. Harabiá with whom the actor collaborated.
Poliívka did not appear at the oral hearing today.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabi and his team are parasites of Bolek Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
For him, in the face of the words Kingdom of Wallachia, everyone comes the image of the actor and comedian.
The same idea has Harabi, too.
"We've been after us for about ten years of work.
Search for money and invention of activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that is why I could receive something too.
They want to live as parasites of our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the brand Kingdom of Wallachia was used first by Polívka on his television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat.
Then it was not a question of orienting him towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabia came up with the idea of editing the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From that comedic origin it turned out to be a business and a lucrative business from which Harabia later created the company Reino de Valaquia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature on passports and even offered his holders discounts to the viewers of his farm and attendees to his shows.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabi only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on stage for her own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabi and his team who dedicated themselves to it completely.
The collaboration, between the decomposed parts, continued until the year 2000 when Harabi was organized for Polívka the official coronation in Vsetín.
From that moment on there began to be conflicts between Polívka and Harabi, whose culmination came with the overthrow of the "King Boleslav I, the one chosen forever."
The leading role in the kingdom, through Harabi, led to singer Jarmila, as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed an indictment against Harabi and his company, which has been rejected by the court to date.
Something clear could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, which is already preparing Harabi.
The new king should come out of him.
He didn't want to reveal any further data or dates.
"We're not in a hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can present himself," Harabi added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices overcome
Actually, I've never liked Peugeotu 206 too much.
Its running characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there is his successor, the Peugeot 207, in the market, and this one, is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, about the headboard space in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the Combi body means in this sense, which I will not suffer before two meters in length.
Flying around the world
I step inside quickly so I don't repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only flaw is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would value the design invention more although the car already seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we were complaining about short seats and backrests.
Also unlike model 206, the side direction has improved considerably.
And space, and here you can feel how the body measurements have grown.
In the Combi the aforementioned shortage of space at the headwater disappears.
Suitcases to the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is its trunk.
This I must value it as very accessible (thanks to the folding rear gate) and well-distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that are an ideal solution.
They don't bother, and can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, on a basic basis it has a capacity of 428 litres which compared to competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the vehicle of the same best-selling type in the Czech Republic, the Ekoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mladá Boleslav's model, we find out that the Peugeot lags behind with its perceptible 52 liters.
On holiday abroad or when placing the child's stroller, its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I have to quote the floor that is quite flat after I lower the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Our automotive test was equipped with a four-valve injection yield on a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth is how a 1600 that despises the family five doors should look like.
It is silent, it consumes little and above all, it has momentum.
If I compare it to the time of the Ekoda then that it seemed as if the exhaust pipe was covered by a rag, I can say that with this one I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, keep in mind that we have tested a vehicle elegantly equipped and with a very good engine.
The basic price of the injection-ignition car of 1400 for 329,900 kronor, still can be.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The Premium type tested already reaches an additional 80,000 kronor.
Only we would still have airbag in the headboards, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wiper, automated rear windows...
I mean, the car with everything, costs 531,900 kronor.
It's a lot, but it has the team's complements in the Fabia and it will reach a fairly similar number.
Now it is only before it is decided by which of the two brands.
Slovak students do not integrate into English schools
Children from eastern European countries attend English schools and therefore locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools have cases where conflicts between migrants and children of natives are increasing in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children into British schools is very well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between the natives and Slovak emigrants are beginning to grow.
Discussions, storing and bronze among students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has come so far that Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was sticking to a ten-year-old student with a green rod.
In her defense she said the girl was insulting her son with racist tone insults.
Police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak migrant.
The girls cheered him up with racist insults and threw stones at him.
"When we were going home, a boy came up to us at the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to leave him he made us the gesture of throwing apples and pears at us, and then he lowered his pants and showed us his ass," he described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the Slovak student's mother.
Complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with migrants from eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools is beginning to be quite tense.
70,000 Slovaks are registered in Britain who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For the viewers it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be fulfilled, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, big waves or a quiet sea like a pond.
palm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or varied cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean Sea island you can find all this and much more.
Only on an island it finds much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
In the time of the Spaniards, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called her, the most beautiful place I've ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port of the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and took to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
He was ordered to build one of the American mafia chiefs, Lucky Luciano, as everything that was criminal in the United States (and therefore forbidden) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High buildings emerged in Havana, along wide avenues ran cars that were a symbol of worship in the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought himself a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Middle Bodeguita left their signatures the stars of the world of entertainment and politicians from all over America.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita Hanense you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar of the expensive National Hotel, you mix your cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cars already cult of the 1950s, until today they continue to operate in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat who arrived a long time ago have rusted among these humid and salty winds.
Although Havana, especially the old quarter, is deteriorating markedly, there are no such wonderful colonial monuments in the surroundings as there.
Other places are metamorphosed in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and in islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and is highly valued by rail lovers.
Sugar cane is transported from the huge plantations to sugar factories by narrow roads in steam or electric machines.
Their garages for tens of years were not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose brother models in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The best-known place for most viewers doesn't change.
And so, it is not necessary to talk about Havana or Varadero anymore.
Perhaps, just remember that in the aforementioned estate of Hemingway there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not stop visiting it.
The Viñales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows in limestone lands.
Mogotes, limestone rock pylons and rugged high rocks in the falls of the valley, and fertile lands are acclimatized in its caves thanks to which rocks form that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is probably the place where the highest quality tobacco is grown in Cuba.
Visiting one of the habaneras factories of cigars you can find their final product.
Somebody might find it interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was shot there.
Trinity
Old town abolengo that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought it fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with constructions in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by French settlers later, has barely changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the mountains of Escambray, is a place so far away that even in the 1950s there was no road linking it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore, neither, was destroyed, because each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than a single afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in the nearby surroundings such as Ancón Beach or the sugar factories valley.
The night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
Small city in the far west of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful on the island.
Surely that opinion is already confirmed by the very path.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantanamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as by a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (in reality it is a cross that arrived 100 years after the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was and that now there is a hotel with its same name, you can see the mountains and among them the best known, the Anvil.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgin of Charity of Copper, the Santería, the African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, many pages could be filled with all this.
However, as it is said, better to see it once.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans Say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment needed is what is influencing the mission's march in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to the American defense minister, Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mison in Afghanistan is not turning out as thought, the representatives of the countries holding troops in the southern part of the country coincided in Edinburgh, Scotland.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement grow, today the eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week, through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to increase activity, Britain is seeing as a priority to strengthen the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable people to be able to start economic and security development alone," Defence Minister Des Browne told BBC radio.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels according to American army data is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent shares grew compared to the last year by 27 percent, and in Helmand province to 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, of which a quarter are in the south of the territory.
For the United States, however, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of organization and equipment of the units.
They are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and pra experts to train Afghan units.
"We'll have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and the way we'll achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
"I'm not happy to know what we have on earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have ninety percent of soldiers and equipment we'd need, and that's little," De Hoop told Reuters news agency at the close of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries attending in recent months, there is controversy as to whether all the allies make the most of Afghanistan.
For passive, for example, Germany was criticized.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the fighting demands there are not as high as ours, in the south and east parts of the country," Gates said.
The sensationalist newspaper Sun this week called German soldiers vague.
"Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are engaged in playing while our boys fight," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild responded to the attack and posted a photograph of the British troop playing a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will reach $1 trillion in 2009
For every Czech the State owes 84,000 kronor.
Total debt in September amounted to 842.7 billion kronor.
This year the government planned to lend 152.9 million kronor.
However, in early December the ministry cut the plan to 152.8 billion kronor thanks to improved the evolution of the state budget economy.
The state debt of the Czech Republic grew at the end of September to 842.7 billion kronor.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion kronor.
Since then, since June, it has fallen 13.4 billion kronor.
Thus today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the state debt in early October.
For every Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 kronor.
Across the past year, the state was indebted to more than 111 million kronor.
"For now it seems that thanks to next year's low deficit we could cross the border of the billions of crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between $900 billion and the billion kronor," he said for the server iHNed.cz, the economist at Homeland Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, Next Finance economist Vladimír Pikora also sees it: "We could spend the billion in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we don't know yet.
If the situation on the political scene were to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But such a change I don't see it," he added.
Doubt grows
The state's debt creates debts in the central government and stems, above all, from the accumulation of the deficit of the state budget.
The state debt is paid through treasury bonds, state bonds, direct credits or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's domestic indebtedness grew this year from 38.5 billion to 71.9 billion kronor.
Foreign debt for now has grown from 1.7 billion kronor to 123.3 billion kronor.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 80.3 billion kronor since June fell by 13.7 billion kronor.
The average maturity of the state debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total year-on-year debt from the first to the third quarter is 13 percent, which is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from obligations where there is 20 percent growth.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand it shows that it will be negotiated until there is a pension reform," Pikora said.
Best of what is expected
From the state's debt payment and debt management strategy for 2007 it is extracted that the government planned to borrow 152.2 billion kronor this year.
In early December, the ministry scaled the plan down by 152.8 billion kronor thanks to improved developments in the state budget.
The amount is composed, above all, of the deficit of the state budget that this year will be 76 million kronor in view of the planned 91.3 billion kronor.
The rest consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech consolidation agency with about 13.3 billion kronor, the reserve of 10 billion kronor for pension payments, 43 billion kronor to finance the state's obligations and 1.8 billion kronor in payments of the European investment bank's loans.
He compared Juartm today to a court to have given a name to a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan to insult Islam has been sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of leaving pupils aged between six and seven to give Mahomet's name to a teddy bear when any depiction of the prophet of Islam is unlawful.
It was a lash penalty.
This 54-year-old British school teacher, based at Unity High School in Khartoum in Sudan, was arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with attacking Islam and sedition, under article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, as a result of several complaints from parents of pupils to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually dates back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the class's teddy bear.
"Eight names come out of the mouth of the children, like Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after one vote in class, 20 children in 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the bear photo with the following legend "My name is Mohamed."
The bear he - himself he wore no labels with this name, but the problem is simply that of the depiction of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I just sorry that I asked children to vote for a name," according to him as just an "innocent mistake."
Opinion divided by numerous students of the school teacher who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never speaks of religion in class..."
Let us remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different modes.
This name often chooses from Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child in a family).
But what are the rules that concern the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is of course a question of interpretation.
They have not reached an agreement on Wednesday on the future status of the province, during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians have ended Baden in Austria on Wednesday morning, a sixth and final session of discussions without being able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach a status agreement," said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, during a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was "at stake," his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, called on Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not foresee violence for now but enter a very difficult period," he added, noting that "obvious tensions exist."
End of mediation on 10 December
The Troika mediators, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go one last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province populated with 90 per cent of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
Baden's discussions, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the Troika was commissioned by new UN mediation last August.
Americans and Europeans believe their mediation will be completed on Dec.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on a pursuit of negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and is committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of U.N. administration in Kosovo, the West consider independence under European Union supervision to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve it in its favour.
Belgrade insists on an autonomous economy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," announced the president of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where these "last-option negotiations" had been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, a former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, has given some of his sorrows.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "was belonging to a past that has led to homicides and deportations."
" Domino effect "
Serbian President Borís Tadic has considered that a compromise was always feasible, warning the Kosovo Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade says it is particularly fearing a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible. "
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belongs exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a veto.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word "
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have started: in the Security Council. "
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the statute," adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanians would be made "in consultation" with the Wests.
Bush starts an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference meeting by himself on Tuesday to Annapolis in Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations in view of finding final rules of procedure for the 60-year-old contentious point between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace deal" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both sides of their obligations regarding the itinerary for peace they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would "in conclusion a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues."
This designation covers the three main problems of the disputed point between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the American president, Abbas insisted that the coming negotiations be "global and deepened" and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing "Judios, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things."
Going back to the rostrum, Olmert pledged to make the negotiations "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008."
Bush set the end of the year 2008 for the launch of his "vision of two Palestinian and Israeli states" that coexist.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made an effort in this regard by Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation to Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plane, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because the roots of the conflict and its central aspects are attacked," Prince Saoud estimates in his Arab newspaper interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
As at every time in these kinds of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation by the General Inspectorate of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17, Louise-Miguel Street, to Villiers-le-Bel.
"I was not in intervention but on patrol, and was circulating at 40-50 km/h, without rotating lighthouse," explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, "unapproved, or unauthorized to circulate on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young men without helmets, circulated "to all gas."
"He chased the police car on the left side after a breach of the cede the pass to the right," police said.
Alcohol control over the occupants of the vehicle was shown negative.
The state of the car - the front deflated, cracked windshield, uprooted bumpers - testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the Attorney General of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thére de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for "facts of involuntary homicide and denial of help" to the IGPN, collaborate with the departmental directorate of public security in Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor states that the investigation of the IGPN, to this stadium, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate three witnesses to the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed "the police version, namely that this minimotocycle came relatively quickly to your left."
Yesterday, a type of slot, undoubtedly caused by the rubbing of the calzapiés on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been stuck in the time for the police car to slow down.
The vehicles have been encoded and will be the subject of a technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumour quickly circulated through Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police officers would have left the site very quickly, thus not providing relief to both young people.
The IGPN, being cautious, would also remove "any serious fault" worrying at this point.
"It is the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs further research, on which you have to be very cautious," a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows that precisely gives to the scene.
"We went down right away, with my cousin who is a nurse to the hospital, to try to revive them," says this witness.
There was nothing to do.'
Then he saw "a completely despised cop, limping.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young people, the room was talking on the phone.'
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, the certainty that people present of the unexpected situation of the young people had, the police have been taken by car by colleagues who had legendized on the site.
Always according to this witness, the reliefs arrived "about twenty minutes after the police march."
They also performed heart massages, in vain.
'I won't let it assume that the police services didn't bring assistance to the young people.
These young men have been helped.
Firefighters arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday repressed the first demonstrations since the establishment of the emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken in the emergency state have been injured by the tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter replied with stones, wounding policemen.
At least 350 lawyers have been questioned.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers loaded and injured lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, lawyers for the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations were reportedly taking place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement on Monday picked up the support of the religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president "called on the population to send flowers to the judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and the waste they swear to in front of Musharraf."
" Musharraf's promise doesn't meet anymore"
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly referred to the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to rule in the coming days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections, on October 6, to the indirect suffrage, of President Musharraf.
The president of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
"Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's rulings," the judge told The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president "doesn't value anymore" after the establishment of the emergency state, Assistant Information Minister Tariq Azeem said Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The assistant minister of information also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to reside by his deputy army chief.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unpredictable
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as poorly planned or unexpectedly overcome births.
Even today, more than one pregnancy of every three (36 per cent) is not expected, reveals a study carried out by the National Institute of Population Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as poorly planned or unexpectedly overcome births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or sterilet still have a failure rate of 5 per cent to 6 per cent, Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed a better "fertility domain," according to the institute that notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 is from 5 per cent in 1970 to 60 per cent today.
Finally, eight births out of ten would be well planned today.
They even calculated just over a month for a couple in five and if possible for spring, season judged to be the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours of work in space for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) to carry out the spectacular repair of a torn and indispensable solar panel for the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky exit that accumulated the records because of their duration, their departure from the habitable modules, of the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "punctuated" by astronauts to make the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when astronauts had released the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a thick cylindrical piece commissioned to soon host European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see frame).
This module is a type of landing platform for the modules-laboratories.
But we have to be able to provide them in electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the reorganization of the solar panels of the module that are 76 meters sized.
And it's where one of the panels, which unfold as accordions, has been damaged in just a metre or so by a cable that was stuck.
The deployment has been stopped so as not to damage the panel anymore.
The astronauts, who initially had a control outlet of the Discovery shuttle, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to engage in the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go snail at the end of the 30 meters long of the remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to make the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" of Nasa.
Tall, resilient, very skilled, he has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been in charge of "operating" the "wounded" solar panel.
After having inspected the damage precisely, he severed the fallible cable and installed types of "tabils" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second "spacewalker" that had stayed close to the airlock and, inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a hockey minibath wrapped in with insulators to prevent electrocution on solar panels producing several hundreds of volts, has been conceived and "punctured" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making inventory of its instruments and returning to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a noon off before seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle for the return to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the Stock Exchange
EADS shares are currently down on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautical and defence group announced it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with A400M delays.
EADS loses 4 per cent to 21.96 euros currently on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to review its forecast for the operational outcome for 2007 in response to delays engendered by the slow progression of the engine development of the A400M, which will condition the plane's inaugural flight.
The cost of alleviating the delay in the delivery of the military transport plane, announced in October, amounts to "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion for Airbus," announced the mother house of the European builder EADS.
Due to these loads, EADS will be forced to announce new operating results (EBIT) targets for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, adds without any more encrypted precision.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that EADS' operational result failed 86 per cent in 2006, essentially due to charges linked to delays in another programme, that of the very thick carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first installment of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians will be massively elected to President Poutine's party, Russia united.
Confirming his aspiration to stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today addresses voters a televised message on public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the list for United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is revealed to be crushing.
Yesterday, the president left nothing transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, content himself with handing over a new burden on the West accused of interference - his predilection issue during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incident," he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign tainted by pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there are "never had such dirty elections, even in the time of Eltsin."
After last weekend's crackdown on demonstrations, former Czech Republican-World Jackau Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, visits are prohibited according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus "
Behind these legislative elections without surprise two much more open questions are emerging:
Who will succeed Poutine for the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and elected again in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Poutine play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chief of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful united Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, to the legislative elections as presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they do not feel masterful of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent centre Levada.
Historian Nikolao Kopossov, of the state university of St. Petersburg, goes further back: civil society fell behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine restored the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic relief," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "resign of their own free will from the personal responsibility" of those who had briefly given evidence after the outbreak of the USSR.
" Why reflect? "
The phenomenon touches all social strata, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia..
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name of the Russians not voting for extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old professor: "What to reflect for?
Those in power aren't too bad, why change them? "
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, Bad Arolsen's Nazi archives, describing the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored over 27 km of shelves to Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not so farable only in a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or his beneficiaries.
The eleven states responsible for their management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them up to searchers and historians.
Since the process of ratifying this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening is effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow for searches "particularly on the displacements of the prison workers, the population of the camps and the state of health of forced workers," explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, opposed the public's opening of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been gathered after war for a practical purpose: to find the countrymen deported or subjected in compulsory work and, eventually, to provide them with proof of their detention, in order to open the way to their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are dealing with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents," Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Search on Anti-Semitism at the Technische University in Berlin, said in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, bilateral trade indo-European already reaches about 60 billion euros per year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18 per cent of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
The European Union's foreign ministers had last April given their approval to the European Commission to begin negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches about 60 billion euros a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18 per cent of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the European Union's 9th trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact will do much over both economies" and "India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. The Asian and European giants exchange annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for " ten billion euros of services," said this week Dani'le Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its potential." L'European Union and India meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England takes note of concerns offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks
The UK bank on Thursday was concerned about easing the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced a 10 billion pound offer to the base index of 5.75 per cent in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
"To ease concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks a greater certainty in the way they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant share of its planned reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," he said in a statement.
The bank says 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on December 6 at 12pm 15 GMT, the base index and until January 10.
It is the first time it appears that the Bangladesh bank BoE has put liquids on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it is "ready to take further steps to keep rates" of interbank loans a day in line with its base index.
The interbank index per day was on Wednesday at 5.829 percent.
The index after three months was set at 6.6 percent, the highest since September 18.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England were combined with a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to some rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the change in the pound with regard to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums taken to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with more assured discretion.
UMP and NC parties deny consideration of PS party's proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre group refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a dismissal of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (meeting for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures taken on Tuesday by the PS's national office, including the 50 per cent increase in job bonuses, the restoration of TIPP (domestic bag per oil products) floating, a check-transport or rental restrictions.
Since UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles (180 voices against 115), the session has been adjourned at the end of the general discussion that led to exchanges, sometimes alive, between majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS MP leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill examined by the Asemblea next week.
A new festival comes out in the light
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Festival Republic by British producer Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it's an honor to work with a person who inspired, no less, the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival would take place August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Once known under the name Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the lead at the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in the Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been in charge of the production, licensing and organising the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as "more inspiring event" he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn's work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked with perseverance with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," Charlie Jones says.
"We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
"Unfortunately, we stall on low-level policies because of the current administration," Charlie Jones chases.
"Fortunately, we were able to argue with Melvin Benn and we prepared to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional place that ultimately will take place in Philadelphia. "
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Chicago's Grant Park, after being detached from the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross income of $9.8M and 11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in urban environment.
"Melvin Benn's European model is a country festival, while ours are more prevalent in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both a impression of country festival to the European and urban way in the American way. "
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the deal, but says "they are quite interesting to allow you to invest in such an event and host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life. "
Charlie Jones says the hotel offer of this festival is "very big," on the example of that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations have been thrown at the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going under press.
"Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all sorts of viewers," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 mates, who received the Top Independent Promoter award for the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.:
Montreal faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract the dishes of Hollywood movies to Montreal when nothing more than Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the delegated functions.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces "runaway productions."
Is it hard to compete with the "Governator"?
"You have to be cautious, it's the industry that decides where it's going.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal are favorable, he's going to go there.
Our role is to offer the best ones," he says.
The race to festivals
For now, Denis Turcotte's priority is nevertheless the promotion of cinema here.
The race for the Oskares is started.
All West Coast festivals, whichever is Sundance, Denver, Seattle's or San Francisco festivals, will have to present Quebec movies, give them courage and make sure that the filmmakers do interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
He will be presented to the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on the billboard for Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock exchange? Experts, divided by 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional end-of-year rally to arrive.
However, this year experts are not so clear that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December on the stock exchange usually has positive behavior.
However, forecasts should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, even more so because in the current context, uncertainties lurk in the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of the stock market taking a wagon in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is supported by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the flight effect towards quality values both in long and short sections."
For this reason, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral behavior, not without volatility "especially because the impact of the likely decline in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions."
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say that there will be a rally.
"There's not the thing for many joys," says the expert.
The Ibex has lost about 4% since the peaks on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.
Yet not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year on these dates.
However, the expert notes that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes the rally will be ahead of the second week of December, after the Constitution bridge.
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, values that we are close to technical levels and "so we could see a bounce of the index that could be driven depending on the news coming from the US regarding the consequences of the crisis in the credit market."
The analyst is confident that these will be positive.
Analysts agree when choosing the values that will be in charge of taking the Ibex to new maximum levels.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year it is up to the great values."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two big banks and some construction companies "because when the date arrives, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco, assures that the rises will come from the hand of banking and the industrial sector.
Construction companies will also be able to benefit from this rally, if it occurs.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," explains the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, on only two occasions December has been a bass month.
The real end-of-year rally was held in 2003, when stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the puncture of the technological bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded a rebound of 6.68%.
We will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (for the moment the Ibex rises by 8.36% since January) and whether it manages to count on its end-of-year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate much of its offices.
A total of 200, those located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group to decide to make the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8.30 p.m., and open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8.30 p.m.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that it wanted to extend the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of their offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of Popular's experience will be decisive for other entities to sign up for or not to this initiative that supports the schedules of shops.
This is precisely the objective that Popular is pursuing with the project.
Capture private customers who move around these areas to make their purchases, to SMEs, self-employed people and street shops chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling of existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by the clients of the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The head of commercial banking, Ángel Rivera, assures that this restructuring does not involve a large investment, although if a greater recruitment of staff, since it goes from having about six employees per premises to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested his initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, according to Angel Rivero.
The branches of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets in Madrid have been chosen, and it seems that it is right, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the brand Mundocredit, specialized in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these premises of PopularMax they will not repeat the model of BBVA, where several of their offices have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers,' Rivero says.
For the time being, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles the value on the Stock Exchange of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
We've made it.'
With that phrase, Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, expressed satisfaction yesterday at the close of the market, when he found that the chain he directed doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect tarnished his joy: 'It's what hurts me, it's not because we've grown more but because we've gone down less,' he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we're falling less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a 2.54% advance.
That gain puts its loss so far this year at 15.66%.
The stock exchange value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday yielded 1.52% and accumulates a 40.5% drop since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed media companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million Prisa (editor of Five Days) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the fact that 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we rent it out in terms of audience.'
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television network this year to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenue, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the advertising of the group.
If this data announced were made real, the television network would register this financial year an increase of 3.6% in its advertising billing compared to 965.4 million in the financial year 2006.
For its part, Antena 3's net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the financial year (to reach 734.4 million) while net television revenues grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors pointed out by analysts for the best relative evolution on the Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that, although it is too early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to leave our shareholders happy, to whom we have already valued with 33% of Endemol."
According to analysts, the market shows at the moment of a certain tiredness.
Lehman Brothers recently lowered its profit estimates for Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009, 7%.
It is due, they explain, to the fact that it has cut its expected income growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same firm has lowered Antena's profit forecast by 3.5% in 2008 and by 7.5 per cent in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force 1 November
Parallel to its parliamentary process, which ended today with the vote by Congress on the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of getting the two into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation in order to ensure the protection of investors and to regulate in detail the activity of the entities so that the markets function efficiently.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernization of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and encouraging cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new regulations will make it possible to provide financial advisory services to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services firm (ESIS), financial advisory firms (FIA), which joins securities companies, securities agencies and holding companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the implementation of transactions on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are joined by multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment firms to disclose on the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and forms of risk management and requires them to keep track of all transactions they carry out, in order to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In his passage through the Congressional Economics Committee, several amendments were incorporated, among which he highlights that securitised debts are considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high danger to the investor, which has been demonstrated by what happened to the debt of high-risk US mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was taken to legally delimit the functions that can be carried out by graduates in Economics and Business 30 years after the adoption in 1977 of the royal decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work as an employee, will not require authorization from the CNMV and will be able to provide its marketing services for products and the recruitment of clients to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonised CPI rises five tenths in November to 4.1 per cent
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an advance in how prices evolved in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advance indicator is calculated using the same procedure as that used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advance indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the definitive data, which will be released on December 14.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice president and Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, said that the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November is a "temporary figure," but at the same time has predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes has pointed out in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential with respect to monetary union remains "more or less" the same in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there have been less surprise" than in the previous month, when the government did not have such a high rise.
"We expected a figure of around 4%," the Minister of Economy acknowledged regarding the data ahead today.
Virgin plans to raise with Northern Rock 42 billion euros in three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50 per cent to 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros) since it entered crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At that time he amassed record deposits of more than 25 billion pounds, a figure that has gradually fallen in two and a half months due to the mistrust of its customers and despite the 100% guarantee of that money offered by the Government and that will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the entity with its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenue in British banks that are deposited over the next three years to get the remaining 18 billion pounds to reach the target of 30 billion.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for its eye-catching advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock this week named Virgin's consortium bid, which involves three other companies, as its favourite to rescue it from bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana arrested for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) for his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the council and the head of the municipality of Police have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and until then regent of the municipality, and who according to sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'captain' of this plot.
The officers continue to search the municipal units and the Urban Planning Council and no further arrests are ruled out in the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect in the plot of urban corruption uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As the SER Chain reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore affluent, was arrested leaving Morales' home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, eight people are in detention.
Bono agrees to lead the PSOE candidacy for Toledo and preside over Congress if they win the
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the president of the government and secretary general of the socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE by Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of Congress in the event that the socialists win the general elections.
This was announced at a press conference by the Secretary of Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting he held this noon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best."
In addition, he pointed out that "yes it seems" that the Manchego politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín, who made public on November 15 his decision not to stand for the next general elections and to abandon his career in active politics to dedicate himself to fighting climate change at the university level on November 15.
The former minister has acknowledged that the president of the government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political forefront since he left it two years ago.
In addition, he pointed out that, just as citizens know who the economic vice president will be if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over Congress, in an "act of transparency."
If he gets to office, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or cry." and make it "more and more like citizens."
"Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't speak calmly and quietly is Congress, the president of the government was once interrupted in the Senate 26 times."
He also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good work" and did not want to see himself already occupying his position so as not to fall into what, he said, his opponents could see as "prepotence."
Climate propaganda
Given that the anti-climate movement is subject to mercy persecution of both skeptics of their predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is obliged to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement that is president of the government as Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even intends to sign a "new contract with the planet."
This approach obliges him to explain why his government's action, or inaction, has made a decisive contribution to Spain leading the EU in non-compliance with Kyoto.
Who is responsible for the non-compliance, in what sectors it has occurred and why your Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it requires it to explain with the utmost clarity to the Spaniards what measures it will take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be affected, what citizen habits should be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be obliged to do, what economic consequences it will have.
I mean, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there haven't been and there won't be those explanations.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Actions against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even the penny of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so electorally dangerous to Zapatero that he has hastened to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothingness, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of all real consequence.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
Whenever it just becomes a purely virtual contracting party and don't pretend we're riding a bike or refreshing ourselves with the fan.
Arrested the mayor and the head of the local police of Totana for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Council and a hotel businessman for possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation have reported today.
The building was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose units he is currently with numerous agents, who have also gone to the Town Planning Council and the municipal company of management of the Industrial Soil and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six carried out last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but are charged in the case file, which is being heard by Totana Court No. 1.
The first six detainees have been brought before the courts today.
According to the sources, the former leader of Totana and today regional parliamentarian of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the current girlfriend of the former governor, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of Grupo Nuaria, the Vigo lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Soil of Inmonuar, an agency integrated in the aforementioned Group, and through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven searches, most of them in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was then arrested in Totana, in particular the owner of a well-known poultry products company in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was in charge of developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa."
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that were requalified and its project would mean doubling the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the Vigue parking lots of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico square; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconice, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of elements of construction.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment yesterday in Finland's most important newspaper (by the way in the head of the PISA report on educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that there appeared, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the symbol of Philosophy has leapt to the public as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the deaths, a high school student, cited in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Minister of Education in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes."

A colleague passes on the introduction of Internet download offences in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal records worth less than 400 euros from the store, it is considered simply missing (article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to 1,000 euros from the store, theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still lower than that imposed on download (article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains lower than that of the discharge (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous quarrel has a penalty of three months to one year (article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would be sentenced to six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a DVD film, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorized films of the authors is more punished than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Anyway, if my colleague is right, someone is getting their hand away, a very long hand.

My GP takes one of his articles on rare research entitled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
That is, the feelings generated by the workers' monthly pay depend on what colleagues earn.
The study has been conducted using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Life&Bin Institute's Neurocognition Image Group in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed."
The researchers observed that if they were both successful received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received twice as much, the activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Balkan prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals from the prosecutor's office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for the Hague for eight years.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bittersweet taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died - former General Ratko Mladic and former Serb leader Radovan Karadzic remain at large.
Their names are on that list of which the documentary by the Swiss filmmaker Marcel Schepbach, 'La lista de Carla' (2006, not released in Spain) takes its title, which, with the pace of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the fleeing criminals and pressure the governments involved to narrow the siege.
How sure is it good for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of potential claims, is a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, card seniority, marital status, type of vehicle to be secured or using it, among others.
Having the car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we have to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured company.
This commitment is reflected in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for its responsibility for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, card seniority, marital status, type of vehicle to be secured or use of the vehicle, among others.
Insurers set their prices according to statistics, so that the higher probability of an accident, the higher the fee to be paid.
That is why both those over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower casualty rate due to their prudence.
Also, taking advantage of the counts, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the probability of having some kind of mishap.
By increasing the frequency, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
That is why the driver must study the situation well to choose that car insurance that best fits his profile.
Here we will present the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that this, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 years of age find themselves with various disadvantages when hiring insurance at an affordable price, such as the reduced experience in driving and the seniority of the card.
Although the ideal to be well insured is full-risk insurance, there are other cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for a full risk with franchise, so that they get the coverage of full-risk insurance but at a more feasible price.
This kind of agreement would mean that the customer pays a part of the amount of the accident.
"The part of the amount of the buyer provided by the client will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," says Luis Noguera, head of Spain of First Europe, online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, but not to those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and vehicle loss.
A tip.
If you are under 25, try to be careful and avoid the casualties as much as possible, as this will have an impact on the bonus, being able to reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate held by the company.
Instead, a penalty is a surcharge on that base rate.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of the company.
If the company has had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses," Noguera explains.
After the 25-year range, drivers have it easier to hire insurance, as the accident rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is best to take a full risk with franchise.
"Normally young people cannot make use of the experience previously acquired when it comes to using an accident, and even at the time of driving," says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the rookie' has already passed.
However, if the client is married but still has no children it is preferable for him to negotiate full-risk insurance, as long as his economic situation allows him, of course.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest accident rate, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one at all risk with a franchise (may be this of 300 euros), or, when a high level of bonus is available, one to third parties extended from the third year of the vehicle's life.
"They're running more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power to afford to take on a larger amount of franchise," says Luis Noguera.
For retirees, full-risk insurance with franchise (being this one of 150 euros), or one to thirds is recommended when you have a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible casualties, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that suits us best according to our personal situation.
Celtic look for Milan a point worth the eighth
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective objectives in the closing of the 'Champions' league, as the Italians serve to be first and the Scots to sentence their classification.
The Italians score ten points and already certified their pass in the fifth day with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that the Shakhtar, with six, and that he receives Benfica, who has four, does not advance him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan has to play the Club World Cup in Japan, where it debuts on the 13th in semifinals in search of a place for the final of 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the draw at the Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go out for a victory, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better cross in eighths.
Gordon Strachan's team could even be a defeat to qualify if the Shakhtar does not win, but he cannot be trusted because the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanists will try to bitter the night the Scots, who are confident of getting in eighth for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round last campaign with a goal of Kaka in the extension (1-0) after 0-0 of the one-way.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar who is only worth the triumph, in case he loses Celtic, both to get into eighth and to continue in UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being last and without options to continue in the top European competition, could reach third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first Spice Girls tour concert in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at Vancouver's GM Place Stadium that the group's reunion is "brilliant."
About 20,000 people sold out tickets to witness the concert that included a video recounting the story of the group that made anger at the end of the 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects its main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls went on stage wearing bracelets given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd who crowded the GM Place, despite Victoria's nerves having banned him days earlier.
In the run-up to the show's start, Victoria Beckham noted that the British star "hasn't seen our wardrobe at all, so I'm nervous about what she's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed its nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm happy to have made the decision," Chisholm said of the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that over time, "things have been fixed and we all love each other very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last performed together in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon arrival at the airport, an army of nannies was waiting for them.
Among the five, seven children are.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), in San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
In Madrid they will perform on December 23.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
Russia's growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of Russia's fuel exports to Western Europe.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so every friction between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
An earlier dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, monopoly gas owner Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine had to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it will charge Ukraine more, as it has pledged to pay an extra 50 per cent in 2008 for gas coming from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be that Ukraine pays 40 per cent more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
"Changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments about the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut off supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a fall in exports to western Europe, which quickly raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU's supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian nations.
NHS 'should test foreign workers'
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor the criminal records of employees outside Europe, a watchdog has said.
Auditor-General Robert Black's recommendation came after it was found that a foreign doctor was linked to the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of how many foreign staff it has.
However, his report pointed to other checks that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor-general checked the number of foreign staff recruited outside the European economic area, following the attacks on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after crashing a jeep at the doors of the airport's terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who performed at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, charged in connection with the alleged car bomb attacks in the United Kingdom.
The NHS hopes to carry out pre-employment checks for candidates, to ensure they meet qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the UK.
Although Scotland's health board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Britain.
The auditor-general's report recommends, among other measures, that boards should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," the report says.
Mr Black said the Scottish NHS had a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but said: "Our report highlights the areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available to the number of NHS foreign staff."
The president of the BMA Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is unclear what the added value of the recommendations made is," he said.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign people, most of them doctors and nurses
But the auditor general warned that the number may be higher, in part because boards have trouble identifying which employees have indefinite residency clearances.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures put in place by NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being fully complied with.
This includes passport checks, work permits and qualification check.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the pre-employment policy and guide for foreigners in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was very keen for this work to be carried out in the wake of the Glasgow airport terror attack.
He added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in updating the pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups - including foreigners - what they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates film awards
Control, the biographical film about Joy Division's late vocalist Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the Independent British Film Festival, including the award for best film.
The trophies were also given to protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named best actress for the thriller "Notes of a scandal."
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the variety prize for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis's rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in black and white - featuring soundtracks by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with just 3,000 pounds.
But the Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic album cover of U2"s album Joshua Tree, was also awarded two awards - for best director and best debuting director.
Rock music was the focus of another winner at the ceremony - like Julien Temple's film about The Clash vocalist Joe Strummer, won the award for best documentary.
The award for best actor was won by Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of the Russian mob boss in London, in David Cronenberg's film Promises of the East.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The 50, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel "The Queen of the Crystal Skull."
Winstone said he was proud to receive that award, named after Harris, star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard HArris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was fortunate to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, he's really an honor."
The independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Supporters and patrons of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrests 208 Terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 terrorist militants planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television the world's largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda supporters have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
An eight-strong cell made up of foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, the television report said.
Saudi Arabia created a 35,000-strong force to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the world's largest oil plant, after a failed Al Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement from the Saudi Interior Minister, said 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert," who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned to smuggle eight shells into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning murders of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they must be more active in stopping Saudis traveling to Iraq to join as militants to al-Qaeda to fight Allied forces and back the Muslim Shiite government, which is considered heretic by the more extreme Saudi Suns.
Al-Qaeda militants are targeting many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by authorities to support the policies of the government-dominated royal family.
The militants - recruited by calls from Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader, to harass the country's pro-Western government - targeted residences of government-associated foreigners, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, for five months of work," the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
Those arrested also include a "media cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose objective was to promote "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sweeth Muslims who support violence against Muslims considered to be infidels and apostates.
The arrest includes 32 other people accused of providing support and financial support to the militants.
Venus Climate can give an idea of the future of Earth
Venus may once have been a suitable place for life, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like an Earth twin than had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Million years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus into a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for the Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, provide an overview of how Earth could develop catastrophic changes because of the climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from Oxford University's Department of Physics and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, says: "It is clarifying why the climate on Venus is so different from Earth, when it is two planets so similar.
"Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago."
Police seize "rich obio"
One kilo of radioactive material, which they declare is enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the footage was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
It's still open.
Mitt Romney says it's not worthy that presidential candidates answer questions from a snow monkey.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a YouTube debate, in which ordinary voters tap video questions and send them for dissemination to candidates.
None of the questions raised on the afternoon of Wednesday, November 28, were more ridiculous than that of the snow monkey who asked Democrats about climate warming in the debate of the Republican YouTube party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the Republican party state ahead of next year's election.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates for aspiring.
But the first half-hour of debate, the longest on a single issue, focused on immigration.
The issue is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to raise the dial when they heard ideas they liked: broadcasters noticed peaks of approval when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The toughest exchange of words of the night came between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a leading spot in the crucial Iowa and New Hampshire polls.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation because he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work at home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and give them the possibility of obtaining citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, reached agreement on the issue.
Neither has the word to be nominated, but both remain in the race perhaps because they both warned about the issue of immigration before the others.
At least on immigration, and generally, candidates share views: increased surveillance at borders, intolerance to illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with fear of China's toxic toys and other concerns about abroad, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
To Mr. Guiliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether diving in water should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led to Mr. Giuliani stumbled upon the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the history of the Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first in the most recent Iowa poll, thanks to his longtime Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pressed to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed, saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the elections.
The race remains unusually open.
The Mr. Huckabee is growing in Iowa, coincidentally with the fundraising campaigns of liberal Ron Paul, and his heated statements of Wednesday's debate.
They two have come out from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole to sink in, but it also emerges
As political scandals remain in England, this is not particularly interesting.
There don't seem to have been sold influences, nor are these excruciating hotel accounts in Paris, or sucked extramarital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the English Labour government party, of more than 650,000 pounds ($1.3 million), for nearly four years using fake names, and the party did not report it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister evaded calling an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence by declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that he would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the Liberal Democrat leads with growing wit, because the feared Mr. Brown has gone from being Stalin to being Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and the poverty of judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code has put business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative sloppy.
A trio of retired generals started a riot in the House of Lords, protesting against cuts to military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now it's the many donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour general secretary (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown walked irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach a turning point after they find themselves unable to govern.
People don't believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch takes over.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve things, that he does not have much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government gets on the defensive and doesn't focus.
On one side, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
Even if I wanted to renege on Tony Blair, he was his top lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the authority registration tax are related to the decisions Brown made as chancellor of the treasury.
And even if he's not directly involved in Blairish's setbacks - or "partner-for-partner," the inquiry into political party funding - voters may assume that if he is.
However, the situation of Mr. Brown is not as bad as he seems.
The gaffes are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
Like Mr. Bean, no one's dead, no one's been directly scammed.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what the naturally Stalinist tendencies of the Mr. Brown has always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
The Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to charity gifts, says he doesn't want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be the case, but the decision is not made by him.
Anti-anonymity laws for big political contributors are clear and there is for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those who have the power.
The Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abraham, who was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the fundraising chief who was asked about donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these actions, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the prime minister has done half the job.
He has been quick to condemn his party for breaking the law, but it is diluted in decision-making for a family matter, a commission of inquiry into the matter - driven, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been broken, it's a police matter.
Besides, there are other things than Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent head for the Laws on Public Life Commission, as he has not had one for six months, and must also push for genuine party funding reform.
This will require hard-working Labour with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation with the unions - bitter measures for a partisan like Mr. - Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and solid competition.
Sharks cards
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural for some dorsal fins to be thrilled around.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes on the country's credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis spreads other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already seen.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been repaid or are more than 30 days late respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million charges in its American consumer finance business, in part because of the weakness of card borrowers.
However, it is too early for panic.
Lateness and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third quarter of the crime rate of 3.89% was almost one percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in American law on people's bankruptcy (2005) led to a sharp drop in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a big loss on credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore late payment) would be growing again, or conditions for borrowers may have worsened.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of their debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed securities is pretty strong, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of infection of the subprime mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to load credit card debts now that credit institutions are expiring.
But credit card issuers look more at the flow of liquidity than active securities, so falling prices don't necessarily trigger a change in borrowers' creditor capacity.
They can even work to overtake the issuers.
Incentives for consumers to continue to write off the mortgage decline if properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, payment of the card's debt rises on the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions for mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of rapid asset challenge.
"We're not going to wake up one day and reassess all the loans," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's finance chief.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a credit crunch push America into recession, the industry is undoubtedly facing a more severe future.
You have to keep watching those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went on trial for their responsibility for the frauds with the former head of Enron's financial office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found not guilty of seven counts of fraud for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at Royal Bank, became a celebrity cause in Britain for the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, his case marks the loose end of an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were from alerting Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into the fall of Enron.
The indictment against the bankers - he doubled down on "NatWest Three" - alleges they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his previous senior aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of a myriad of fraud in Enron, which helped its spiral of bankruptcy fall.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary's interests at zero, but the three Britons knew it would value rising.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest at $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 in interest on the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million were left in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers raised $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two counts of conspiracy to collapse in Enron.
The trio of Britons were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence at a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million they required to live in the US while the trial was held.
Enron, one of the seven largest companies in the nation, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make its failing business look successful.
The collapse caused thousands of jobs to be lost, more than 60 million in market terms and more than two million in pension schemes.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and previous chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were charged last year for their roles in the company's collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the wealthy Russians.
"It has capacity up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, a representative for Gulfstream.
"But none asks for that model of so many seats because it is for family private or for presidents of a company."
The Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day orgy of consumption held at an event center near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, hoping to lure new wealthy Russians to all kinds of products, from mahogany-in-house yachts to diamond-encrusted car grills, worthy of 50 cents.
The Mr. Firer cautiously looks at a bright orange Porsche at the neighbour stand to his.
"It's a beautiful car, but it's nickel and cauldron compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets."
Fuel-supplied by the oil boom, the Russian capital looks like Dallas when it was at a heyday.
"We lived the same thing in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, a senior lecturer at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
"Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the biggest consumers and spenders in the world."
The world's most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the cake.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the wealthiest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local thinker.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 per cent of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attends the fair for the first time with the brand's Russian distributor, the Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are impeccably prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in afternoon suits, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Yumatova, who re-edsrawed the designer suit he wore as a veteran carpeting network with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay for several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum cutters, ice cream from Movenpick, tables for in-service pools, apartments in Dubai and Teddy bears of Gund.
The general public can buy tickets of 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best," Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically in a stand of the Dutch Royal Delft porcelains, in front of a mural-sized reconstruction of a painting of Rembrandt, made of hand-painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in bling-bling."
In fact, the sellers said wealthy Russians of more history (10 to 15 years, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from flashy logos to limited edition brands, which would not be exposed at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people: cash millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, CEO of King Koil beds, said he sold two $7,000 mattress systems each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton woven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said it had sold three chain bracelet-shaped car grills, for Rolls Royce Phantom, at $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with rays embedded with Swarovski-colored crystals, so it resembled a roulette wheel. The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
The cost: $22,000 for a set of four.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of buckets of zirconium, isn't necessarily going to drive on those wheels," Mr. Karapetian.
"He's gonna keep the car in his garage, along with another 30 or 40 cars."
Even if many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase "Russian billionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the wave of prices of real estate.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably a millionaire, at least on paper if it's not cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich for the support of the Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red phone booths (British style) stuffed with stacks of fake $1 million bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing officer, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped to shake up stacks of money, asking friends to take photos with their mobile phones as they rested on piles of money, or pocketing a couple of millions.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," Karryev says.
"Putuza" surgery could be the cause of death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the "A Little Hit Healthy" restaurant window and watched an ambulance climb through White Cape Cod, two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car showed up.
And then another.
"Then I saw the ambulance go up," Mr. Livingston, the restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
"That's when I heard someone had died".
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Investigators are now trying to determine whether she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by police, but works at the 212th Avenue home. - West Scott.
Authorities still don't determine what caused the death of the swoman. Arroyo, but wait for the tox screen, although the results will not be available for a few weeks. This will help solve the mysterious death that has saddened the higher ranks of the Newark police officer.
Ms Arroyo had been an assistant to the police officer, Garry F. McCarthy, from September 2006, and his voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious," says Mr. McCarthy on Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guardian".
She protected me".
The Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and left two children, aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesman for the County Union Attorney, Theodore J. Romankow said detectives are trying to determine whether Ms Arroyo died following an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said the home was reached about 3 p.m.
On November 21 and Mrs Arroyo was found on a sofa.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
It has been more than a week and authorities have said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, named Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms Walsh could not say whether Ms Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Ms. Castro's home, where a withered rose is located at the front of the house, and a Dalmatian barks in the back.
A blue drum labelled "varik ethyl vangelline" - used as a vanilla substitute in food and perfumes - was at the garage door, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks to the side.
The Mr. McCarthy said that when she arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was one of an invaluable help in meeting the new island city and its tough political culture.
"She would say, "You have to watch with this or that one,"" he said.
'She was always here when I was, and also when she wasn't.
It's embarrassing.'
Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates to lift stock market
Shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market waited for the Federal Reserve to ease credit terms with interest rate cuts, which rose with reassuring comments from the US central bank's vice president.
Stock exchanges loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, the reserve's chairman, declared that policy makers must be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to continued tension in financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid growing signs of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said the recent turbulence was "in part reversed by the improvement in the market in late September and during October."
If the upward trend persisted, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is poised to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets and make further interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
The remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy, such as home sales that hit the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were accentuated by a warning from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4 percent of its total labor force, in an overall cost reduction to offset the losses of its investments in sub-prime U.S. mortgages.
Only 20 of those posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, or 2.55%, to close at 13,289.40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of Britain's top companies.
Germany's Dax index rose 2.6 per cent, and France's CAC40 was above 2.3 per cent.
Earlier, the reappearance of credit tension in markets was highlighted after strong demand in a three-month fund auction by the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure from the Bank of England to follow the action of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and inject extra funds into the London stock markets, strained credit and three-month "Liber" lending rates among British banks, meant the biggest rise since September, at 6.59%, after a steady rise since November 12.
England take Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara's demands with trial
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should beat No.6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important against the first Test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection who is on loan - with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, decide; and also because the desk of England manager Hugh Morris is beginning to fill with offers to become national selector, and if not, in one part time.
Anyone who doesn't get sixth place in bat will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and the sport too.
It is not easy to throw away what a man does at the top of his profession, while another is never beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than capacity.
Not only in cricket is the choice difficult, as judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is this the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another respect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good degrees and who know the business well, would have been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricketer, unless they give him the chance to sink or swim to the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but so do they have opportunities as well.
Within a team, a cricketer has to catch the captain's eye at the same time to take a wicket and a batsman to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to make an impact as a player one day.
But catching the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were plenty who improved last season, for example James Anderson, who will surely play in the first Test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself to fit and bowls as the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 runs each to earn a spot.
Chris Tremlett took just 29 on the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more of them.
Shah or Bopara's games at Asgiriya Stadium may be just a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it can make a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well in the first, with five wickets and 40 runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who became a major player, and despite scoring a hundred double against Australia in Australia, he may still be underestimated.
The likelihood is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after further discussion at today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and foster Shah's greater experience of exuberance of the young Bopara.
There are arguments for both of us.
In Shah's favour is his brilliant and valuable Test of debut in the early 88th at Bombay, 32 first-class hundreds against just six of Bopara, who, on 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent antecons against spin bowling.
But Shah made only 10 runs in his two overs in May against West Indies in the Test at Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection from selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, appearing to have taken something from his batting from him in Bombay.
By contrast, the Essex team has joie de vivre in swords.
He turns on for nothing on the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he overturned his vehicle in an exhibition for England's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate looking in the distance, to say excitement: "Did you see that?"
Bopara is the best player, he is including his slippery pass to have effects on his moves that seem to satisfy him, as he bats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean Shah does not stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, it is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who ran out of cash, without extensions of the visa and those who hoped the city would return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At Mansour's bus station, even before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," says Sunni doctor Sabah al-Qubaisi.
"I came back today from what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and that is safe now."
"They say Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he says, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, which ordered his troops to cease a momentary cessation.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite and teacher in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in their country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah phoned him to tell him that a U.S. Allied force helped drive al-Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of Jordan's new arrivals was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad for a grenade attack, after he urged citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my colleagues."
"That's why I'm back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were attracted to the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops engulfed groups of "concerned citizens," armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many said they had returned for visa denial and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, gave voice to the common suspicion among the exiles, that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, called on the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugees' visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of the sectarian gangs of death.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to the Iraqis, to force them back to Iraq," the Sunni said.
'I can't believe in a government supporting the criminals who set my house on fire after I left it.'
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that the Sunnis have been driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, easing tension.
There are fears that a sudden wave of refugees will resurface sectarian tensions and start the fight.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines through the international orientation of its higher schools.
As across the country, the Slanders lack only one educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the 50th time a non-Swiss who are not French" - that was the ironic bike on itself in the smallest federal state for its centies.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a major role in the Sarre education system, which in a study by the Institute of German Economics (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" ranked fifth.
Thus, higher schools traditionally have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrcken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until now, students can finish their college career here with two or three dipoles.
As a result, the procentration of foreign students is high, 15, 6 per hundreds.
However, the number of students from Sarre is higher than the average in higher schools. Many of them don't have a bacillerate.
"In the Sarre the system of professional education is used," says Axel Plennecke, the education sector expert at the Institute of German Economics (IW).
More than five young people do their baccalaureate at the Professional School. Thus, it turns out that the Sarre is 7 points above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, in relation to the number of people, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and growing demand, the number of graduates in engineering science has fallen by one third in recent years.
That was why the Ministry of Education of the Saarland forced higher schools to advertise more for the specialties in Engineering Sciences.
"After the first PISA study, we carried out some reforms in general education schools," says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative testing across the country.
For children to start studying the final year of the project called "Kita-Jahr" as soon as possible, it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also mimics the other federal states.
Comparison with the upcoming studies will show whether students' performance has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of students in school development fell from 29 to 20 per cent.
But overall, the Saarth didn't get much better like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
To the displeasure of the Salandes, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Although the Sarlanders are not French, the language of neighbors is a compulsory subject at the Institutes of Secondary Education.
Chavez changes the time.
Next in Venezuela there will be another different time zone from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez lets change the schedule in the South American country by delaying the clock half an hour.
Chavez is currently running as a comedian in Spain.
As reported by the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State, according to the new law, the time will be less than four hours GMT.
In this way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chavez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies hissitation by saying that the United States should impose an obligation on the world in its day by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the breakdown of relations with his neighboring country Colombia because of the hostage-taking action.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not have any relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until conservative Alvaro Uribe remained Colombia's president.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so," says Chavez, who is pushing for constitutional reform where citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
This reform could expand its power in the country quite a bit.
The reason for the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe in withdrawing Chávez's mandate in negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas in which it was the release of the hostages.
On Sunday, Chavez said he criticized that Uribe's decision has offended Venezuela.
Also in Spain there is a lot of talk about Chavez.
A new tone of call causes sensation in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that has already been downloaded by half a million people.
This phrase was uttered by the King of Spain who was upset by the continuous interruptions by left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decline in real wages threatened Germans.
According to a forecast, a decline in real wages this year threatens German employees despite a strong situation.
Experts present a lot of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to the calculations of the Hans Bockler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real wage account in 2007 than the previous year.
"The fault of that is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value added tax and the styling of food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Research of Economic Cycles told "Bild" newspaper.
New unemployment insurance burdens may also be on employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrck told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbracker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% over the next is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the Labour office does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credit and subsidies from the Federal State, in the words of a politician from the German Social Democratic party.
On Tuesday, the inflation rate with the burst of prices in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector was made public at its highest level for 13 years.
Comparing prices to last year, these are increasing by 3 per cent.
Venus: twin brother of Earth.
Despite its atmosphere not suitable for life, Venus is the most Earth-like planet, something that had not been raised so far. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and swirls at the poles, the same ones that also appear in winter on Earth.
For three decades, researchers had a suspicion that there could be rays on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus the rays fall from a height of 54 kilometers of one cloud and behind another, Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles tells the scientific journal "Nature."
According to the famous model of the origin of Urey-Miller's life, the rays caused life on Earth: storms may have provoked reactions in the ocean that, on the other hand, would have given rise to amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus it is not: if there was ever life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and temperatures of 500oC recur on the surface, oscilling in such a way that temperatures below zero can be reached.
"Possibly, Venus is a "diabolical" twin from Earth, but he's still a twin," Russell said.
The main objective of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so Earth-like for its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since there were no special missions since the 1990s, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus' research.
The latest results of the research to be presented in many "Nature" articles, according to the researchers, underline not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighboring planets have more common features with the Earth than we had assumed," reports ESA.
Despite the already known stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers discovered in the southern polar region also a vortex formed by the fastest rotating clouds.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the high terrestrial atmospheric layers of the poles, according to a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet in the Solar System has the mass almost equal to Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers is almost as large.
This planet also called dawn star or evening star orbits around the Sun for nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day on Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and with its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars does not resemble much Earth, scientists start from the basis that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets there had been agglomerated water on Earth that remained in the oceans, but in Venus it was dissected in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, in Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties for the Dalai Lama reception at the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, worries about Germany's reputation and that's why he demanded that the grand coalition end that fight over the reception of Dalai Lama.
"In this case we should not present ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler told the newspaper "Handelsblatt."
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding of the Dalai Lama's reception by Angela Merkel (Christian Democratic Union Party) in September.
"Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are of absolute effect to me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in getting into foreign policy, the Federal President stresses, defending Merkel for the reproach she received in a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of One China's policy.
China knows that too," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Foreign Minister (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly expressed his displeasure at the Dalai Lama reception and was attacked by members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
Dalai Lama's reception at the Federal Chancellery caused great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the German Finance Minister, but also, according to information sources of the magazine "Spiegel," he froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the head of government, demanded Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception from Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians receiving the Tibetan religious leader in their official position.
Dalai Lama's actions and words showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now also includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that there will be riots such as those in France.
Battles with police in the streets, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that riots will occur as was the case with France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not move to the streets.
Barricades were held, vandals fired at the police with rifles: after serious riots starring young people in France, the Federal Minister for Home Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Christian Democratic Union Party) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We have to look at ALSO that the social problems of our country do not take violent form."
"We have to take that seriously," he told the newspaper "Neue Presse," published in Hanover.
Not all young people unfold in the constant change of social reality.
The federal state, federal state and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
That's not exactly what immigrants mean.
"From the Integration Summit to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing its fruit."
It's still too early to take the end of the alarm for granted.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The youths staged serious riots in the streets with police north of Paris over the past night.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Tolouse.
Kenan Kolat, the president of the Turkish Community in Germany, demanded greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of a copycat effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
However, the proceedings are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under 25 is above the average.
More vocational training posts need to be taken.
Kolat stresses: "We have to give a perspective to young people."
The president of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families," greater than the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says: "But despite everything, we have to be careful."
Young people must be given the opportunity to receive a job or vocational training faster."
Meanwhile the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen took part in the action, a helicopter with headlights flew over the territory.
The responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burnt cars.
Since the previous day a team of almost 1000 police officers has been dealing with security.
After seeing a suburb, Home Affairs Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced that police will take rigorous action until it is necessary.
About 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel on Monday night to Tuesday.
The riots continued the next night in Tolouse.
The disturbance began in a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young men died.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of the youth was not because of the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The action far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor shows that the coalition in terms of content reached its last point and that nothing more should be expected from it.
But what country does the Chancellor really live in?
After her desperate performance, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House, it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by her.
As for the reproach he was made for repeatedly engaged in foreign policy actions, the Chancellor rejected it in a presumptuous phrase.
He said that would be a provincial mode and so he showed that he did not want to understand what interests critics.
In the Lower House, it was very clear to everyone that this reproach was appropriate.
There could be no minimal interest, no feeling for the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that flees in foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything in concrete.
One example: the prevention of climate change: she very much praised herself for the decisions made at Heiligendamm, but she says nothing about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising herself - for two years the head of the Party of the Democratic Christian Union has not been able to afford so much modesty.
Well, he's engaged in expressions so that a boost comes to people.
And in this way it damages his public image by the pragmatic conception with which he solves problems without going through the branches.
But in Angela Wolke's kingdom, the inner problems are low-value appearances.
The poverty of children and concerns for low-wage workers?
All he does is talk about this subject using subordinate prayers.
It's awesome how many times you're wrong to talk about when it comes to the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good phrase.
It begins to stumble "as if it had been in an unknown territory," when it came to more specific information.
The section attacks.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, made a showdown in a heated debate of Republican presidential pre-candidates on YouTube and must now fear only a candidate from the outside.
Tensions between the candidates are already visible from the outset.
Mitt Romney reproached his opponent Rudy Giuliani for making New York "a refuge site for illegal immigrants."
He, for his part, responded with serious reproaches: "I would like to say that his own house was a "port" for the illegals." Giuliani responds to the former Massachusetts governor, saying he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attack: As so far the Republican group has no clear favorite, the eight presidential pre-candidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, shot by internet users who were sent to Youtube, don't have much content either.
"With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power," that was John McCain's reproach to his opponent Ron Paul, the only one of the meeting he insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives much criticism from Vietnam war veterans, when he refuses to recognize "Waterboarding," a method of questioning, as torture, by letting a person drown out simulate his death.
The public's reactions in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida show that in the meantime the most important issues of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates about torture.
The public always applauded very loudly when they praised conservative values and denied raising taxes.
So you can see better where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"At that time I was wrong," Romney explains, explaining and apologizing to people and the television audience for being an advocate of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf rules without uniform.
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
That's the end of the eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Thursday, Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's president, took the toll for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday he transferred his mandate as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after he took power with a bloodless military coup, the former general first rules the state as civilian chief.
With his resignation as head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf served as the opposition and the west.
The other demand is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state's attorney general, after the swearing-in Musharraf will soon cancel the state of emergency and will serve the second condition in the west.
Since a state of emergency was proclaimed in the Supreme Court, there have been many pro-Masters jurists. Last week the country's Supreme Court rejected all appeals ahead of the government's controversial new election on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watirstan region, five soldiers were killed and four others injured.
According to information from the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
Krautrock's founders return.
The most famous German band of the 1970s is continuing their activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-enactment, a copy of "Live 1974" was made that was written in the band's best time.
Already at that time they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has in front of him his box, his wires and above all his buttons.
In the middle is Dieter Moebius, 63, dressed in a white shirt.
To his left is Michael Rother, 57, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking out of the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes with their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
Looks like this doesn't bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock's passionate was the fact that the band Harmonia was making music again.
What needs to be revealed here is this: the questions have accurately shown that the band's name rumbled in people's minds, but it wasn't something special that after 32 years the audience would miss it so much.
But why can't Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because the misunderstanding Kautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an "Echo" music award to members of the band Can 2003 in Cologne for their work of life, in the room you could see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Dusseldorf und Neu., they all opened their mouths in amazement.
Later Michael Rother spent time on stage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are just one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio existed only two years and in those times I did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, it was later obtained thanks to the others.
Moebius and Roedelius had made music with artist Conrad Schnitzler a while ago and had a name, Cluster, who promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist in the band Neu. He achieved the fame of this German band that was too radical at the time.
In 1973 Rother followed Cluster musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 16th-century ruin, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was more of an artist's life full of surprises.
One day, an association bandit from Ottenstein's Harmonia singing bandit appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also downsides to the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux."
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn't just to know yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmonia and do from time to time rehearsal.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up on songs of esotericism and secured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen."
Cluster revived the 1980s and since that time has been more successful than Harmonia had.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that must be thanked to Groenemeyer.
His music company Grienland set itself the goal of cultivating this German contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like Roedelius's work, the band Neuá was also discovered again.
Harmonia's presentation as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidised by public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There's Julian Cope, English, old punk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler."
There too, the Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all of Krautrock's influences to the next pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super-band, a position that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, she is departing the flaw."
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers on a farm.
The story of the development of the legend is shown in the projections of black and white photos, where instruments are seen with cables.
In the background there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but fix the microphones to the organ and battery so that they can produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices they had built with their own hands.
Currently electronic music is as it had to be.
Three people who delve into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere you cough, whisper and in a good moment of emphasis you sing "Aaaaaaaaaah."
Krautrock was always a term of English origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever screams "68" here is also right, but now Harmonia keeps calm.
On stage, it reflects very well on what is already evident.
Where does it start and where does the music end?
That can break one's nerves or give away quick lucky moments.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again dedicated to war in the Balkans.
But they both weren't very convinced.
Or the concepts are very much fixed on actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the Balkan mountains, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, actor Richard Gere was again discovered.
We had finally lost sight of the handsomest man of the eighties, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and minor roles in women's films and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument for seeing perhaps the film "The Hunting Party - when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why do movie titles have to be so long and nonsense today?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the view: deep down, its role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the destination and film industry hadn't been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life have passed, who, as a monument of the ruin of his decadence, has so far preserved most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party," despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is the German production and will also be presented this week, turns out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a nutshell: these are two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbian from Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost to the actions and shootings, although we welcome the fact that the Serbs are not once again presented as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm Fuer Cobra 11" without a motorway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because there was never really a good film about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another script author (Richard Shepard in two counts), the story about American reporters in the war who leave to detect a war criminal serbio called "fox," could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now."
Thus, the stories are strikingly similar: small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army cannot do and it is a crazy journey every time.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when we are initially introduced to Simon Hunt, who is not left to be simply a heart-thart cynic.
No, the script also foresees a love affair with a Muslim Bosnian they'll kill next.
Then "The Hunting Party" is a far cry from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with impressive speed achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the world's head hunters, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians to take revenge in a fair way.
It's so bad that they want to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on crimes against cinematic logica.
However, the film's purpose is, in fact, a profly human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karad-i- and Mladi are still free, and stresses that the Americans and the French are not really worried about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so you come to mind a very famous poem by Brecht.
In this pemo is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing feelings with him, which is hard to be bad."
In films like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons, but they show that hard is to be good.
The problem is not only the genre of war films in the Balkans.
He recently published in a newspaper that all films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
You can also add that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
Almost always worth a rule: when a star gets into a region of crisis or minefields, then something like "Rangoon" appears with Patricia Arguette, "On the Other Side of All Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Bloody Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
They have to spend at least decades until Hollywood rolls a good film about the holocaust taking as an example the film "The Schindler List."
Some movies already need more time. Classics such as the Vietnam War plays "The Deer Hunter," "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their time were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about global conflicts, and that's why in our time every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that's because the scriptwriters don't have the slightest objection (which is necessary to be able to) in telling good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" proved so good at the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know how bad the Nazi regime was actually.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to shoot a movie.
Perhaps you have to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look of an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Dictionary of Lemprire" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That is only because some things never change."
Big cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly killed and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives negative criticism of the Olympic Games in response.
The mayor of Hamburg received much criticism from politics and economics for not requesting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to keep fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust recalls that you have to be realistic in estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, managing director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said on Wednesday the resignation was "not good for the economic site."
In the last time no other project in the big city fostered as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
"Without this goal, the political momentum, sporting momentum could not be maintained at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded that the Senate not forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "which refers to another time."
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that Hamburg's ambitions in organizing the Summer Olympic Games would not be held until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but is decided by the German Olympic Sports Federation," von Beust says at WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December on Munich's application for the 2028 Winter Olympic Games.
"This preference means for us that in this period of time, which we have so far thought to have until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will have no chance."
"Despite everything, this dream didn't end forever," von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It is too early to let the opportunity be removed, if at the moment the plans are ruined," said Gonter Plo, the director of HSB, on Wednesday.
A waiver of the request is contradictory to the statement of the head of the Senate who made at a reception at the general meeting of the German Public Sports Federation of the Higher Schools (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's request for Universities 2015 not as "a replacement" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Federation of High Schools Sport named Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bergerschaftsfraktion) Fraction reproached the Senate for not taking advantage of the valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate was delaying the development of the small Grasbrook neighborhood, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always required integrated Olympia planning for small Grasbrook and then the use of the houses built, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's application for the 2012 Summer Olympics provoked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Whoever relates the terms of Sweden and wooden box thinks about Ikea, but doesn't think about Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow weighing on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "type" bright-blocks of this list are fake.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" put the doubt on Andy Warhol's 1968 authenticity of Brillo-Boxes, Stockholm's Museet Modern Museum carried out internal research and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes," which the former museum director Pontus Hultén gave to the Museet Modern Museum, are false, and almost a hundred of the other "Stockhol rate," which are in circulation in the international art market, are also the result.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Boxes Bright" in New York, painted the wooden boxes of red, blue and white, with the same sample that they had cartons of powder of "Bright" soap powder.
According to Warhol, hundreds of glimpses of cardboard brightness were exhibited at the 1968 works at the Museum of Museet. They were not made by Warhol (because of the expenses), but were brought directly from the "Brillon" cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but specimens (which were only objects) exhibited.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed a wooden shine-box to be produced in Sweden, but they were not exhibited at the Modern Museet Museum.
Witnesses from those times now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at the time entered the history of art and auction as originals of the "Blue-Solomew" of "Stupid" authorized by Andy Warhol.
At auctions some of them were bought for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost one hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmo for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had already died for 3 years.
Lars Bystrom, the head of the Conservatives of the Modern Museet Museum, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First they printed and grinned their tight silvers and then painted them to the oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the painting was applied with an unprinted roller directly the tight silvers. In addition, it is not about oil painting, but about acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from Andy Warhol's official Shine-Boxes list," says Lars Nittve, the director of the Museet Modern Museum, adding that if the "Andy Warhol Art" Authentiary Commission in New York will not reach any conclusion, the Museet Museum will classify these six boxes as the copies/objects of exhibition."
Already in July The Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "serious accusations" in which these are boxes of soap powder.
But from that moment there everything remained in absolute silence.
Rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
Rebel soldiers who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila have surrendered in the Philippines and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The ringleader Antonio Trillanes, who reproaches the president for corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for shedding blood.
Soldiers loyal to the government had stormed the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers have been entrenched in the building for a few hours.
Nearly half of them, including Trillanes, had a trial on Thursday for having attempted a coup in 2003 that ended with a failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, so suddenly he could settle with about 30 supporters.
Evidently the military police who had to watch him had gone into their ranks and followed his mutiny.
They entered the hotel "Peninsula" and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The president called for an urgent session of the Security Cabinet.
Norbert Gonzales, the national security adviser, condemned the soldiers' behavior.
"People are fed up," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to move on to our ranks."
Gen. Danilo Lim, who previously ran the elite Scout Reangers troop, said the other military troops soon wanted to continue the march.
Major government critics on Thursday called for a large demonstration against the president.
For months his government has been rebuked for corruption.
In 2003, Manila's financial district was a place that attracted all the attention from the mutiny that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours after the army wanted to take part.
Since 1986 in the Philippines there have been at least seven coup attempts against the democratically elected government.
United Internet will be Versatel's largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday the company reported that the average price for one share is 14, 46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There was much speculation about the company's absorption.
There are also options for further increasing the financial part at Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German market of DSL (Digital subscriber line).
On Wednesday they already made assumptions about entering the business, after the Brendenberg bank increased its stake in Duesseldorf's network operator by 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent.
In the financial market, this means that the financial institution maintains the equity securities for a third-party partner.
United Internet as the previous day had the telecommunications company Drillisch participated with almost 10 per cent.
Drillisch in the capital increase measure placed 17.4 million of the new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies began negotiations on marketing cooperation of the DSL-products.
"We strengthen our collaboration," explained the potravoz of United Internet.
The two companies founded an MSP joint venture to acquire competitor Freenet.
On Thursday, United Internet reported that at the beginning, the two companies want to be happy with the participation of ten percent to Freenet and do not make use of their right, that is, they participate at 18.49 for hundreds of Freenet.
That meant that both companies maintained all options, especially the participation of the public limited company Freenet.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet over a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of Telecom's German market.
By the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and $1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
Until now the United Internet and Drillisch holding had directly 6.01 percent of Freenet's share.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch would get the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment company was already agreed in August.
