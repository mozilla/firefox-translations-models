What's the word? The SSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor the pastry
The new councillors of the SSD in the capital will have to overcome, it seems, the linguistic barriers evident so that the members of the Prague Board and the Municipal Council understand their renewed SDG comrades.
The Aktuáln.cz period "examined" the members of the new SSD Council to check their knowledge of the marked slang language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The coded dictionary using Prague's political flower and cream during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been proven that the new councillors hardly understand these well-known concepts.
At least, they say so.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't really know."
"Rather I am a rookie in Prague politics," said the culture councillor Luká Kaucka.
And as far as the veteran politician is concerned, Karel Bezina reacted the same.
Maybe you know the concept of golf.
"Possibly it's the only expression of everyone you asked me that I use from time to time."
"If not, I don't normally use slang".
From the glossary, whose definitions were published by the newspaper Aktuáln.cz last June before the SDG voting congress, the editorial chose six examples, in particular those that are particularly related to the municipal authorities in Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort," "Most Prague golf hole," "go to the pastry," "toro canuca," "betrayal of the capital" and "beautiful."
Three councillors agreed to undergo the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who will be responsible for education in Prague in the future, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councilman, Petr Dolinek, directly refused to do so.
"I don't get into these things and I don't want to value how civic Democrats have fun."
"What I do care about is how we understand ourselves in the implementation of our programs," he said.
As has been seen, Councilman Luká Kaucka would not have realized that the previous title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janou-ek.
Kaucka says nothing to Kauck, the word "Voldee" says nothing; the only term she hit in the test is "the largest golf hole in Prague."
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," says Kauck, who immediately adds: "But I know more about the news."
"I'm going to have to sign up for a language course," he jokes.
Karel Beezina is not the only one who recognizes in the golf hole the Blanka tunnel, but also the councillor of Environment Luká Placha.
Afterwards, both socio-democrats know who Voldemort and Luká Plach really are even knowing where to find that character; moreover, he suspects the meaning of "going to the pastry."
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; it will soon be unveiled to Placha that it is the headquarters of the Janouek companies.
Like Bezina, he indicates that such knowledge was obtained from the news, but that he does not use such a vocabulary.
According to test participants, there is no such familiar glossary among the socio-democrats of colloquial terms.
"I asked my colleagues, but it really looks like we don't have anything like it."
"Rather, between us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or we make word games with names," says the president of the SSD Pragone, Petr Hulínsk, whose partymates call Hulda.
"At school they called me Bíza, but I don't know if my classmates also call me that," confesses his own nickname Karel Bezina.
The Aktuáln.cz newspaper tested the name and works.
For his partymates, Weinert is Dáda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dodek ("old"), Rep. Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated themselves before the elections deceptions during party sponsorship, receives the nickname "Igrá-ek" ("playmobil") by some of his colleagues.
Nicknames are also the only expressions that socio-democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulínsk' does not like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuáln.cz discovered even other nicknames for this pregán president.
"The doctor of the rights of batons" seems to remember that Petr Hulínská obtained his doctorate in law at the Bratislava police academy.
The Government wants to limit the torture of "witches," as published in a pamphlet
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They usually have an advanced age, they cannot work, for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
Women who "turn" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the village.
"Men rarely suffer such but."
"Healthy young women are also not isolated, because they help in work and have children," explains a nun who, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, cares in a special residence of more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure."
He issued an information leaflet that should help prevent witch hunting.
However, this has a glue.
"Over 70% of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," warns the Die Standard newspaper about the downside of written awareness.
Charges of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Gana, a neighbouring country in Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemmah, 72, died last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to a dismal accumulation of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was placed in the oil used for ritual anointings.
It caught fire when the group wanted to "expulse the evil spirits" of women.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people at all levels of education.
The Der Standard newspaper quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: "The devoters of human souls always posed a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government tries to appease the witch hunt, in the Gambia last year the president was still involved.
"Chambian President Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a wide-ranging hunt for the witches who had allegedly been linked to his death and had tried to kill the president himself through black magic."
"To help him brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president's personal escort, forcibly took men and women randomly chosen among Gambian peoples to the president's property in Kanilai," Amnesty International says in its report.
On the farm, the people arrested had to drink a grassy one with hallucinogenic effects that also caused them intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of those arrested did not survive the stay on the estate.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand people in detention.
Bakala tenant: Heated up with coal stoves and signs higher rent
The elderly and reluctant man crossed the doors of the customer service center of the RPG Byty of the "coal magnate" Zdeek Bakala, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he had documents with the new three-storey leases: his, his, that of his daughter and that of his son, who is serving a sentence.
All three of them have just been caught up in the liberalisation of rents.
Instead of 3,500 Czech kronor a month, the son will pay 4,100 kronor from next year for a two-storey flat with a second-class separate kitchen.
"In addition, it does not have hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," the man shows with his finger in his son's new contract, on whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it," he explains half angrily, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and indecent," recommends that tenants not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when it will publish a guide informing how to proceed in these cases.
But, in the face of this, man only makes one gesture.
"Everybody says one thing," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a major liberalisation testing laboratory.
After New Year, it will occur with the vast majority of the apartments that, in the Czech Republic, have so far been under regulated rent.
That's why Aktuáln.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
RPG's mining waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and, at nine, on Tuesday, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to you a machine to pick up numbers.
"Rental 2011" can be read on a light button on your touch screen.
When pressed, a little paper comes out of the machine with a number.
It hardly gives time to read "157" and already appears on the large screen at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in line.
Soon after, an elderly marriage arrives to ask, but the crowd in the room is not here for the new leases.
Most people come to solve usual problems, such as in the past: requests for arrangements, insurance issues and similar issues.
Letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava in the mailboxes of tenants of most of the 44,000 RPG flats around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in the letters an increase in rent of between 15 and 38%.
A special window opens on the customer service centre on 18 November for new rentals.
"It's been running for a week, so it's starting," the workers who find themselves in it respond briefly after hesitate when the client presents himself as a journalist.
The liberalisation and former Bakala mining floors are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, the Vice-President of Parliament, originally from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the SSD, was dealt with loud and clear, and now appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new floor".
"They didn't even change me the damn bathroom dish," the man mentioned in the introduction drowns.
According to workers, for the time being they are mostly retiring to see if they receive a discount on rent if they sign on time, as promised by RPG's special offer.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before 15 December will also receive half of the discount on the February rental.
However, the window of mining "liberalization" certainly does not dispel the avalanche of doubt.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked about the rent in 2011 about forty or fifty people," estimates the window employee.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on rent, an independent judge will have to resolve the matter.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only way to proceed possible and completely in accordance with the law," RPG warns in its pages.
"No one is going to be tried here," says one of the RPG Byty employees and a man on the street in front of the customer service center, at least in part, for the reason.
"I get a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I don't have the means to go to court," he says.
But immediately the employee sows the doubt.
"We'll see".
"Mr. Zaorálek warns you in the media not to sign, so maybe people will wait," he says.
Rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rents still do not cover even the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund," recalls Pavel Kliame, director of the residential portfolio of the RPG Byty company, who adds that the careless state of the bottom of the community that angers tenants is, for the owners, the main reason for increasing the rent.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest in apartments four billion, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, in front of the seats of the waiting room, now repeats some data that stands out in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, or more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be a maximum of 7.50 Czech kronor per month per square meter," it is indicated on the screen.
The rent of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio is up by just 38 per cent.
"In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low amounts of 19.66 kronor per square metre," says RPG.
At 2,600 flats, the rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalisation will not suddenly affect rents, but will be scaled four to eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rent hike (see the graph) again on the floors, mainly in saving in heating: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to people signing the rental hike deal.
The architects have understood that the offices also need childcare
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say that he also hides inside a small nursery with everything in such facilities: colored walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design's employees can go to her.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, from whose studio numerous known buildings from Brno came, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its miniguard.
About 90 people work at the company, mainly in the baby boom age, and wanted to allow architects and broadcasters to return to work soon after motherhood.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, nursery is one of the benefits offered by Arch.Design to its workers as part of its social program.
Construction companies and architects in this way have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with childcare.
The miniguarding was an idea of Arch's own employees.Designu and, with the support of the management, managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's miniguarding is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme on Human Resources and Employment, as well as the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (a staff of more than CZK 2.8 million) were able to buy the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified staff and services.
When it exhausts the financing (two years), the company Arch.Design has an obligation to keep the miniguarding in operation with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and the financing application was submitted by Economy Rating.
The care of children is in the hands of qualified staff; in addition, a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present all day for her care. The nursery currently accommodates children without age limits, although most of them are under three.
Since this is a "miniguardian," it can only simultaneously accommodate up to five children, although with shifts they go more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use childcare, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is individual education and care, the contents of the miniguarding programme are comparable to the regular preschool curriculum.
In it, children not only play, but also receive quality teaching: from basic learning to school preparation, they teach to English.
The class not only has toys and board games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up children late from school when they are away from their workplace.
Thus, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a loyalty relationship between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the companies that sign that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program reinforced the marketing of staff.
The house of the bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Watch Gaudí's interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs reminiscent of the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Due to her shape similar to a skeleton, the locals nicknamed her "the house of the bones."
Its organic forms, its striking colors, the novel use of the stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of the scales and the ubiquitous gently curved lines, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the house plays with dreamy lines, delicate colors and textures taken from nature and fauna.
Reading more attention, you see a certain geometry, rhythm and carefully thought-out order.
In the evening, the whole facade of the house seems even more impressive, as it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Serpent and the torsion of forms continues to surprise us also within it.
The undulating wood copies the frames of the windows, the railings, the door ornaments, the mirains and the signs.
Casa Batlló, which is located in the neighborhood of Eixample at number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Grácia, emerged from the remodeling of a house of 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on tearing down the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of carrying out a novel and cheaper reconstruction.
However, Casa Batlló, formed by various apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep María Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in its plans of the project, ornaments for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used on the facade emerged.
On the facade other creators and artists also work.
The collaboration in the proposals of the Batlló House was the beginning of Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Casa Milá and the park Guell de Gaudí, in which other pieces of the same are located.
Due to her organic shape, the locals shortly after its completion nicknamed her "the house of the bones."
Others, due to the specific window opening mechanism, began calling it "the yawn house."
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, the sword of San Jorge, patron saint of Catalonia, appears.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious motives.
Gaudí projected in the house a unique system for the central heating season with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Your tilt of forty-five degrees may be strange.
During the construction, Gaudí did not respect the rules of construction of the moment at all and did not be influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permit from the beginning, although obviously in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the city council was so shocked by the result that it requested that it be corrected.
It was upset, for example, that construction included columns even to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, on the contrary: just fifteen days after the city council's request, Josep Batlló applied (and obtained) permission to rent the two tallest floors of the building.
On the lower floors the owner himself settled.
In the second-floor gallery was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The six-storey house is completely crossed by a staircase leading to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the living rooms and a larger group can communicate in this way without problems, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with Gaudí's reconstruction, not only got a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with the light, white and blue tiles covering the inner courtyard and skylights.
The game with the two colors brings the maximum light on all the floors of the house.
It was based simply on the principle that white reflects more light than the dark colors, which instead absorb the sun rays.
Anyone can visit the Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to Unesco's World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most recharged apartment of those accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that this is a very beneficial business and expanded visits to the common area and the attic, including the roof terrace.
The price of entry to the monument is not negligible, reaching 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and tourist card holders get 20% discount.
The amount significantly exceeds the price of the entrance of Gaudí's other constructions in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real bed environment with your lizard towers, you should quickly befriend some resident of the neighboring houses and visit you at home.
How the mattress and the somier are chosen: women and men are looking for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed; what really confers its quality to a good bed is the surface to lie down, that is, the mattress and the somier.
First of all, they must be perfectly complemented so that they adapt to specific users.
During the election, numerous elements come into play, including the weight, height, health status and the owner's sex.
Also important is the type of interior in which the mattress and somier are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that doesn't usually have heating, latex mattresses shouldn't be used because they "heat" more slowly.
In addition, they tend to weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them around more frequently.
If the central channels are not properly aired and, above, they are on a firm basis, they keep moisture inside. It may even appear mold underneath.
When choosing a bed, customs also influence.
Anyone who has spent a lot of time abroad often uses a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower and harder surface.
"Almost all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep as well here.""
"For their crushed shoulders, heels and hips needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
"This type of mattress is also recommended for people with diabetes that has long problems of the nervous system, so they receive bad information from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in padded furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"There is no problem today, because they have these proper Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropico brand."
You don't have to be an NHL player anymore to be able to appreciate the viscoelastic.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimizes its stiffness and shapes depending on the absorbed heat or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing puts pressure on the night, it won't turn around like after a tough game.
Just, he's getting better.
Vicoelastic also functions as protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the length of your feet to your height, i.e. between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed of between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example singles, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
So that a possible visit is comfortable, too.
"If not, you can apply a simple standard to calculate the width: by lying face up, you should have your hands comfortably shrugged towards the elbows," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, expert at Cechu "alouní" a dekoratér, who has been dealing for many years with the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture, a subject she teaches in specialized schools.
In the double rooms, each needs its own somber and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to ride the somieres at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with dock interiors a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softens.
"By touching it with your hand or by settling on the mattress, you certainly shouldn't notice the docks," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of somier.
The fully padded bedrooms, where the mattress and base are like siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and you can't wash your holster, which is often done today.
And, since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime guarantee.
However, everything has a pero.
Therefore, the sellers give advice: on the mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take care of the cleaning and washing of the case, but better add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattress cases with zip closure are currently manufactured throughout their perimeter, so when they open they stay in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine), their manipulation in the larger models (and for a single person) when lifting the mattress can seem like a fight between a flyweight and a heavy weight.
On the bed, instead of a somier, does he have a firm board?
Never.
At most for beds designed for visits to spend one night.
However, you should make (if you don't already have) ventilation holes on the board and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the docks in bags (like the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-entangible sheet sommys containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut fiber) can be used, although a sommier with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lumbar area are reinforced and your rigidity can be regulated.
The joint foil somieres should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to reclining.
In addition to the adjustment of the stiffness of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
This is a special fixation of the sheets that allows you to press or even tilt the sheets in such a way that they "surround" perfectly to the shoulders during sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, it's a very important thing.
They even remember the mattress manufacturers who, in the "masculine," began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are somieres with cross or tablet structure with the so-called multi-stortion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is reduced.
You should also keep in mind that, even if you use the right mattress and solpler, if you use a bad pillow (large and "mullida"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic standard is simple: the pillow must hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can relax.
The recommended suitable size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be on the same level (when combined with the somier with shoulder reinforcement or the softer area of the mattress) as the shoulder height.
Modern mattresses have something to do with the original mattresses stuffed with straw stuffing.
Manufacturers continue to use natural materials or at least mixtures more and more often.
In fact, biological mattresses are fashionable.
Oil-based raw materials, with which polyurethane foam is manufactured, are filled with natural oils, such as castor or soybeans.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin," explains Petr Vasí-ek of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used during the manufacture of the mattress case, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma of forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" with breeze vegetable extracts, so that the mattress case absorbs the heat and refreshes the body, women prefer to "heat" the case.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so women feel more warmth.
The favorites currently?
Mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, making them more permeable than normal polyurethane pumps and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam rigidities make mattresses from various areas that taste perfectly about where the head, shoulders and heels are going.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand kronor up.
Those who play a therapeutic role often have lower VAT, as they are considered as health facilities.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It's hard to save on mattresses and somieres.
Sometimes you can approve offers from manufacturers or sellers, which sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a Memory memory foam attached to the case by 11,990 crowns.
The second is achieved for free.
The era of viscoelastic with an open cell structure and a high density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
Initially it emerged as material for NASA, because during astronauts take-offs were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur softens with the heat and hardens with the cold.
Therefore, the warm human body exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores from occurring, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Vicoelastic foam is not only used on mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use the Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents use people tracking devices to control their children
Fear for children is increasingly leading people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also track people's movement and contribute, for example, in case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Janatková.
At the moment the device is about the size of a match box, but will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were scared of the case of the missing Ani-ka and began reporting on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
"We all try to tell ourselves that it is not a question of spying, but another means of reducing the chances of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they get into someone's bag without their knowledge, but we have not yet encountered such cases."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In their view, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bosková warns of the fact that, if the child does not want to carry him, he will simply throw it away.
"Even younger children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things if they want to prevent them from being controlled."
"Before, the parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but these could be turned off as easily as the tracking device," says Bosková.
In his view, it is debatable whether such a device is really useful in the event of an attack.
"If this is a prepared abduction, the perpetrator will practically always check whether the child carries any kind of electronic device that can reveal his location."
"Now it's the phone".
"As the use of the tracking devices is extended, you will also look for them, since their sale will certainly be done with a lot of publicity."
"In such cases, criminals are always one step ahead of the police," the psychologist says.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the event of a makeshift attack by a paedophile.
According to Robert Eech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers follow-up services for both vehicles and people, even in case, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence can help.
"You can configure the device to regularly send the position after a certain period."
"If you are harmed, at least it will facilitate the last position of the person concerned."
"The most expensive devices have an inclination meter integrated, so if the person simply slips and stands still, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," says Eech.
In his opinion, such a service can be obtained even with smart mobile phones with navigation, in which only special software should be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment they are devices similar to a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they may be lost.
According to Macro Weil's Pilin, for that reason tests are currently being carried out on devices that look like a digital watch.
"Furthermore, they will have the added advantage that a potential aggressor may not identify the device."
"Or that I identify him after a while, which can make the police buy time," he adds.
Although tracking devices are carried on the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is the verification of the position with a GPS system (used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough fuses to surround the entire Czech Republic. But they only last two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometres of wick to light explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence added 224 kilometers of wick to its arsenal.
So, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the wick is two years, four at most.
The army bought the explosive wick from STV Group, a. s. for forty million kronor.
The general's staff responded to MF DNES by justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of fuse by saying soldiers need for training maneuvers 60 kilometres of wick a year.
According to the calculations of the army pyrotechnics, with whom MF DNES contacted, it is decided, however, that, in such a case, such maneuvers with frequent use of explosives each year should also be carried out by all generals, high-command officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They didn't want to be exempt, neither Defence Minister Alexandr Vondr and army captain Vlastimil Picek.
Only in this way could it be justified that the army spent 60 kilometers of fuse.
That length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if so, the army would have enough stock for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two meters of fuse, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the engineering or special units) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
Soldiers from the rapid intervention brigade complained personally recently to Minister Vondra because they say they barely have ammunition for various weapons, so even shooting practices are limited for money.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also don't get to understand that they repeatedly buy us such amounts of fuse."
"But it's their decision and they'll certainly know why they're acting like this."
"For us, the army is a good client that, as a company, we are trying to satisfy," admits STV Group's commercial director, Jan Dock.
Ministry of Defence spokesman Jan Pejek defends hundreds of kilometers of wick, saying he will also have stocks of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Dock, of STV Group, indicates that the fuse only has a lifespan of four years and, in the case of two-year pyrotechnic products for the army or police.
"If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, due to possible criticism from the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of its useful life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, when buying 445 kilometers of wick, he got a discount.
"It cost us 60% less than last year's request of 244 kilometers," says spokesman Pejek of the Ministry of Defence's purchasing center.
Just to compare: the annual wick consumption of police pyrotechnics, which remove World War II ammunition or left by the Soviet army, has not been over 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always ask only for the right amount to exhaust the ammunition before its lifespan ends.
They decided on security reasons for pyrotechnics and, in addition, in the meantime, more modern and reliable types of fuse can be obtained.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in completing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics spoke to MF DNES, after a couple of years there will be the following problem with the current one: hundreds of kilometers of old fuse will have to be eliminated, which is now being bought "barata."
So far I'm still living off the contacts I got thanks to the contest.
Winning the "Employment of the Year" contest helped Luká Pytloun in the sale of his hotel franchises.
The last edition won the "Empresary of the Year" competition the 28-year-old entrepreneur Luká Pytloun de Liberec.
His success story seems to be drawn from a movie.
Luká Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad, he realized that in Liberec it was necessary quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he collected with seasonal jobs abroad and a bank loan he bought a house that was half demolished composed of five floors.
Given that he was still studying his third year in college, he was really brave.
"Today, the value for money of accommodation in our area prompted me to do something about it," says Luká Pytloun.
He began renting the first rebuilt floor to foreign workers.
All the income he earned was invested again in the building, which gradually turned into a 54-bedroom pension.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he gradually managed to open four pensions in Liberec, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
However, this year he opened another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tise, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytlo franchise," said the number one businessman last year.
"This sale of hotel opening licenses greatly helped to win the 'Company of the Year' contest," adds Pytloun.
The victory increased its fame and popularity in both Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
Undoubtedly, he recommends that everyone want to try some company participating in the competition.
But he believes that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he continues to live from contacts and acquaintances who, without the contest, may not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest I have started collaborating regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in the employees,
in total about seventy.
"I have seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that gained general recognition."
"It's not, much less, my own personal success, but it's the result of the hard work of the whole team."
"It's just my name that appears on the front page," says Luká Pytloun today modestly.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we've had in Farmet.
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, Farmet may have already had the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel Eársk, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone "Company of the Year" contest last year at the "Slava House" in Prague.
The jury valued his efforts, with which he managed to turn a small technical workshop into Eská Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight the competition," says last year's winner.
The Farmet company's history begins with the desire to do something useful.
That's why, when the state proposed to Karel's Eársk's father the rent of a small workshop as compensation for the seizure of properties during communism, he did not hesitate too much; he resigned his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of companions, they founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest automaker in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the non-specialized audience after achieving success in the competition in the media.
"Not only did our customers start to consider the Farmet brand to be considerably better, but foreign partners also began to value collaboration with a company that achieved greater success in their country," says Karel ársk.
Last year perhaps it wasn't just a sign of the euphoria of victory.
It also gained recognition for the commercial results up to 2008 and, in part, from 2009.
And just 2009 was the toughest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and begin to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We obviously didn't get rid of that situation either."
"The revenues were reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and we even had some layoffs," explains Karel ársk.
A viable company must sometimes even take unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company's profits, although it was at lower levels than before the crisis.
In spite of everything, where Farmet did not cut costs was in research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training center, reinforced the presence on the international market and obtained magnificent valuations at national fairs," says .ársk.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Revenues are rising again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement expects it to bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel ársk.
A survey that unravels ridiculous rules
The Absurd of the Year poll is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
He's already managed to eliminate some ridiculous rules.
The unfamiliar winner of the new edition of the year's Absurd survey was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was made by more than a third of the nearly 4,000 voters.
For example, the social security administration requested an extract from the commercial register, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech social security administration will no longer request an excerpt from the commercial register when it controls the insured person's impositions," said SSZ spokeswoman Jana Buraová.
The aim of the Absurm of the year survey is to consult the rules and regulations to be respected by companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year it forms for the fourth time part of the business tournament of the publication Hospodá-ské noviny and begins to create hobby among the general public as well.
While last year's edition had the participation of 3,000 voters, this year it almost reached four thousand.
And it's not surprising, since we still have several legal obligations that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in the number of papers necessary for the tax return we are in the world first," says Karel Havlí-ek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, simplification of business rules has been a stated goal of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, the Czech Republic is ranked 74th, or eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdez of the Year competition was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated in the same way each year.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity each year between April and the end of September, when the contest closes.
Proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the organizer of the contest picks seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
Win the absurdity that receives the most votes.
More than 100 were presented for this year's survey, including 105 rules and regulations that make no sense.
The examples were sent by both entrepreneurs and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the contest was the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and motorways pay the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
This year's list of seventy proposals is published on the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the contest, which is always held in early November in Prague's Wenceslas Square, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world usually participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kuel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic, attended this event.
"Economic prosperity cannot be sustained if the state continually hinders entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to remove absurd regulations are not left in drunk water.
In 2007, what bothered people the most was the obligation of the entrepreneur to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention to go to a fair or exhibition with a post.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended second in the number of votes in 2007, i.e. communication to the labour office by its foreign workers of work trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the so-called green card.
And the third is the vanquished.
The 2009 Absurd was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a fridge and two soil scales.
That is why this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to dispose of a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Eco-diversit, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospodá-ské noviny competition is the category called Responsible Company of 2010.
The task of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
"In this way we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebel Degree of the year competition.
For this new special subcategory of this year's edition of the main competition of Vodafone Company of 2010 were presented companies for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between them, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, these are, for example, persons with disabilities, other personal or employee health problems.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Republic was the software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of funds to sponsor disabled children for seven years.
In Podábrad, there is a stationery that is particularly concerned about the health problems of its workers, since they constitute more than 70% of the workforce; that is why it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of Czech Republic and in the contest Vodafone Empresa of the year ended up in third place in the region.
In Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours a week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it buys a priority from Czech manufacturers, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and administration activities produce the least possible impact on the environment," explains businesswoman Milu-e Ryznarová.
The head of TI Enlogit of the region of Estí also thinks about the health of her employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; in addition, she supports work from home and in her business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Person in distress scholarship, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says the representative of the company Ondaej Such.
They are also in good steadfast with a mention of the laundry company Praní a .i.t?ní in the region of Karlovy Vary, whose employees receive special bonuses that have an impact on their pension funds.
"We give benefits in food, transport, improvement of qualifications and leisure," says Josef Strapá, of the construction company of Bruntálza Czasch, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of Responsible Enterprise of the year, all the regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year contest were automatically appointed to the registration form questions and sent it before August 15 to the organizers.
Organizers removed the forms that were not complete or erroneous from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competition companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Company contest responsible for the year, but they are not disqualified from the "main" contest Vodafone Company of the year."
"Individual applications for this competition are not allowed, as it is a subcategory of the main Business Competition of the Year," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose consultancy.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
Anti-corruption police have made a number of arrests in the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
Detectives handcuffed a local media businessman and real estate entrepreneur Lubo G.
It appears that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of the rights in such a way that the auctioned land was received by a precise interested party.
I had to pay Lubo G. half a million kronor for it.
"At the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public tender," Pilsen's chief prosecutor Antonie Zelená told Právo, adding that for the time being she cannot disclose further details about the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, the 46-year-old businessman was released by police.
How he could influence the public auction, given the little official information, can only be speculated.
The spokeswoman for the Lubomíra Eerná Agricultural Fund responded to Právo's questions by saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at the Pilsen headquarters and it was during a public auction.
"It's a customer, not one of our workers," he said.
According to Eerná, the public auction is called "Convening for the submission of proposals for land transfer in accordance with the law on land" and is carried out when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These people, during the call, offer a value higher than their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"Depending on the offers, the order of the buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the largest offer," explained the Fund spokeswoman.
Lubo-G. had information on who was to be submitted to the call and, since he was both an interested person because he acquired various restitution rights, proposed to those interested in the land that he would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of arrest, I had so much money on it.
Lubo-G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was in the case of the former head of PF Václav Sankot, who was charged with dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Lubo-G. has just obtained from the Fund planned land for the construction of public infrastructure, particularly in the place where a large road to the Borská pole industrial area should be built.
Afterwards, he changed them very beneficially with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the city council had to intervene because, otherwise, blocked land would avoid construction.
Families will have to pay extra costs of several hundred kronor a month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher rents.
Families will therefore have to remove several hundred kronor a month more from the wallpaper from the wallpaper from January than now.
Electricity prices are up 4.6 per cent, gas is around 2 per cent, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10 per cent more for the water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should amount to about 100 kronor more a year than it is now.
However, major electricity providers cut prices, as support for renewable energy production, particularly photovoltaics, has increased.
However, the gas is moderately expensive, especially at the time when heating is most used and therefore the consumption is higher.
In this case, they must also have a couple of hundred crowns more a year.
While electricity and gas are expensive across the country, the change in the price of central heating varies from place to place.
The price increase is planned mainly by the largest municipality.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay for the central heating of about 50 more kronor a month from January, while Liberec families will pay more than 1,000 extra kronor a year.
Residents in Prague will also have to endure a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rent of infrastructure.
If the rent does not vary, the Praguens will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will rise by 7.4 per cent.
Rental prices of 450,000 rented flats in Prague, where regulation will end in January, can rise significantly.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 floors in Istí nad Labem, will increase the rent from January by up to 100%.
The company will take those who disagree with the new lease to court.
Regulated rents, which benefit residents of around 300,000 flats, could increase next year by up to 10 per cent.
The young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. Beer is no longer in the way, because it takes effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause them to end up in young medical care drinkers with an age of less than 15 years.
Children who end up lying in hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This stems from the experience of doctors who encounter such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because they take a long time to get drunk."
"Now fashion is strong alcoholic beverages," the head of pediatrics of the Hospital Hoovice in the center of Bohemia, Lud-k Pelikán, tells Právo.
"When they manage to get a bottle from their father from the cupboard, it can be whisky, but it's usually about Fernet and vodka."
"Vdka has the advantage of it lighting up with juice and doesn't smell that much," he explains.
This is also confirmed by Motol University Hospital spokeswoman Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually about Fernet or rum."
"These are modern alcoholic drinks, particularly among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use spirits they took at home," Jurinová adds.
According to Chief Pelikán, it is drinkers of thirteen and fourteen years of age who usually appear in hospitals.
Before Hoovice, where he has worked since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to come in maybe four times".
"It started at the age of twelve, when she was brought in with 3.5 blood alcohol, in addition to a mixture of ecstasy," says the doctor of the department about this case.
"He was at Holeovice's fair at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother wasn't even surprised that his daughter disappeared 48 hours," the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance for drinking on their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, there is no proper need to be spoken of dependency.
"It means an alcoholic to a person who has chronic alcohol dependence for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which is not produced in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment," explains Chief Pelikán.
According to spokeswoman Jurinová, forty drunk children were hospitalized this year at Motol's pediatric clinic until mid-November.
However, the statistics only show those who come with severe poisoning and must remain in hospital.
Young drinkers who, after the street medical examination, go home to the parents or the police, do not count.
In addition to cases where children simply gather after school and drink spirits, for Pelikán there are three seasonal ups and downs that are worth mentioning: witch day, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"In this circumstance, they drink for bad notes or, on the contrary, celebrate the start of the holiday."
"On the day of the witches I have come to see in admissions up to seven drunk children at once," adds Pelikán.
Drinkers who spend the night on detox under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by the injection of a sultry serum and the nutrients missing from the body.
"They're doing much better, because after the hectic night, they get up well and don't hurt anything."
"They're just confused about where they are," Pelikán says, adding that patients often lose good humor at least when they see the costs they have generated.
Ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a serious patient room comes to cost a dozen thousand crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell the children directly how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend the whole summer in a youth job so that you earn enough to pay that night," adds Pelikán.
Health insurance, in his opinion, perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually returns the costs of treatment to people, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are in the hands of others in Spain for the first time
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, departed on Tuesday for Seville, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
This is the first time such a device has been in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
At the moment, they were only abroad for internship or demonstration flights.
This is the two-seater version L-159T1, which the Czech army used so far and was still in a state of flying.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 single-seaters.
These are still preserved in Aer Vodochody and the intermediary of the sale, the company Omnipol, already took care of them last week.
Jan Pejek, of the defense press department, says it is not yet known when Vodochody's planes will be physically withdrawn.
"The L-159 single-seater aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from long-repaired aircraft, with no investment or additional input from the Ministry."
"The two-seaters L-159T1 were exchanged in their current state," he told Právo Pejek.
He added that the army is not running out of two-seater aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-seaters.
One of the new planes was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pejek, EADS pledged to have the aircraft added to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly indicates that EADS is the one that withdraws the L-159 aircraft and that they will serve for the practices of pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how he will use them in this framework," says Pejek.
The newspaper Hospodá-ské noviny published early that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a house plane and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion kronor were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense management says the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired 72 aircraft from Aer and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of home planes may have judicial consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft by making a European tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three home planes and the last should reach Kbely's Prague airport in fourteen days.
A longer index finger than the ringing indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest rate than annul are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British cancer journal.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to 60 years of age," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, Eeles says.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the Indica finger of the right hand shorter than the ringer.
They were the same odds of prostate cancer as 19 per cent of those whose fingers were the same length.
For men with a longer rate than an override finger, this risk was reduced by 33 per cent; for men with less than 60 per cent ages the reduction reached 87 per cent.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies have indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Paes, told .TK that he knows the study, but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer can be "demonstrated completely."
The Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
Czech Republic, like most in Europe, dawned on Thursday covered in snow.
Roads and sidewalks are mainly covered by compact snow and the chitanieve machines circulated through numerous areas all night.
In the morning the D5 road between kilometers 89 and 93 was closed in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of commercial vehicles and passenger cars, as was the D1 in Brno towards Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the automotoklubu (AMK).
At kilometer 91, a truck broke down, in 93 two commercial vehicles collided that caused injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometer 185 towards Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers must move slowly after Brno at kilometer 190 or cross Brno and join in kilometer 182 in Kovalce.
There, traffic jams of several kilometers have formed.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, just off Prague.
Prague is covered by a multi-inch layer of snow and thermometers indicate -7 oC.
Traffic jams are forming for example in Prosek, although it is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Trams circulate late, for example on the line between Karlovo námstí and Námstí Míru.
At eight o'clock in the morning, there will be another state of crisis in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections for three fast.
Problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
Ruzyn airport closed from 11 p.m. on Wednesday night until five in the morning.
Currently, it can already circulate on most of the roads of southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
Three secondary roads are closed to circulation in Bahrain, snow languages are being formed in Bahrainska and chains are needed in Blanenska to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vy-kovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kuerov and also "aratice" - Mileovice.
To clear them, milling machines will be required.
At the moment you cannot say when they will open up to circulation.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of the Bilé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
Roads in the region, which, since it is a protected natural area, must simply be left in an inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to TK.
In the Czech Republic fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, more in the north of Bohemia, where the snow layer reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesia region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snowfalls gradually remit in the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new 'smart weapon'
The American military is using a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known for the time being only by the coded name XM-25.
The generals hope the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that it will "change the progress of the game" to make its victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an extremely precise aim.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
The 25 mm special ammunition created for this rifle and the high explosive charge it contains causes it to actually function as a small grenade.
Projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when hitting the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or trench.
Undoubtedly, normal protection cannot be used and, when it launches its killer metallic splinters, it can be essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to the same laser beam, which determines the distance, then gets a precise point of sight and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and pulls the trigger."
"Let's say 543 metres have been measured."
"When the trigger is pressed, the gun is loaded and the projectile is loaded and throws the projectile at a distance of 543 meters, plus minus one, two or three meters," says Audette.
400 jobs are moved
The Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported by the computer sector giant and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July from its previous office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Strasse Street in the Niederrad neighborhood of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term another 100 employees of the consortium, which were previously scattered throughout the region, will be accommodated there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region yesterday brought joy among those who were in favour and disappointment among those who were against it.
Frankfurt economics section chief Markus Frank (CDU) said that he has earned a "Global Player."
This is a "magnificent recognition of the site."
Fujitsu is settling in the city, the settlement is a major boost for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) laments Fujitsu's decision.
The address earlier informed the city of its intention.
"We have never offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
However, the computer manufacturer's good contacts with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change the difficulties.
After all, the economic motives caused the fall.
In this way, there is now a large empty place to fill in the famous position.
"I hope the owner and the building's landlord will be cooperative."
The property previously used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" was part of the leftover Marienbader Platz buildings for ten years of a controversial construction project for the resort city.
As a joint project of the city and a private company of projects between the station and the city council, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is in charge of the criticism regarding the massive construction that previously used the holes as parking spaces and in terms of the level of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment council and valuation companies, the manufacturer of Software for booking systems, Start Amadeus, have been installed, as well as then joined Siemens with the Fujitsu computer manufacturer.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by Frankfurt real estate group Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe along with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium, originally from Tokyo, is recognized as the third largest provider of IT in the world.
It has companies, such as computers and servers, and also provides the precise services.
The Rhein-Main-Gebiet branch is one of the largest in Germany, Fujitsu has more business in Munich anyway.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries there will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
That's why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The ancient complex of the 1920s, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses, among others the central association of electrotechnics and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
Anguish takes on Wikileaks increasingly.
Internet service provider Amazon has removed its server's disclosure platform.
Political pressure may be found behind following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is reportedly being held in England.
Wikileaks's disclosure platform is always the target of criticism, ever stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are currently searching for an internet homeland in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's wanted list, is to remain in custody in Britain, according to one article.
"Wikileaks expelled from Amazon server."
"To speak freely in the country of freedom," activists of the revelations told via the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents to the Amazon services website to cope with the high figures of access to documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks explained: "Perfectly, we will spend our dollars hiring people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, they "should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks, after an employee of Sen. Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, CNN reported, according to a call to Lieberman's office.
The chair of the Senate's security council had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I had wanted Amazon to take these steps before, before previous Wikileaks classified information publications," the senator said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and inconsiderate Wikileaks process puts our national security at stake and threatens life in the world," the independent senator said in a statement.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with its service to spread stolen material.
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
According to a London newspaper article "The Independent," the 39-year-old Australian is being held in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The internet activist has constantly described the investigation in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats have existed.
"There were even calls about a Julian Assange murder".
That's why you fear for Assange's safety," Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the founder of Wikileaks remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson clearly reacted to the statements of America.
In America, former Arkansas Republican Gov. Mike Huckabee said the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations should be tried for treason and should be executed.
In Canada, said an adviser to head of government Stephen Harper, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should "be assassinated" and Obama could "use a drone."
A major dispute is growing between the White House and Assange.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman for US President Barack Obama, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange has called for the resignation of the secretary of state, in case she is responsible for recently ordering diplomats to be involved in espionage tasks.
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than its website."
The American government needs to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in general.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution for the National Counterterrorism Center, was appointed as exceptional manager, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms," which are necessary in the light of the Wikileaks leak.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the full information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the American government announced that in order to take care of the security of dissidents and activists, they must jeopardize the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice Cream
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna ice creams are prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future ice creams has the highest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream actually come from?
From the gellatee and the gelataio.
The gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of Italian art of ice cream making.
The gelataio removes the cream of the ice cream from the counter with a spatula, spreads it over the bar and sells it.
To know this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the university of ice cream with the freezer in 2003, so that the cream of the ice cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future ice creams has the highest influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate ice cream and internships in the ice cream of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new professional career, others risk the soft ice cream of their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of this art in California, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business advisor and wants to create something of his own in a few years within an enervante job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
One man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of their bars ice cream, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master ice cream Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants later the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
It is not only his good taste, but also his silky softness and his good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation or the cream cover of the national upper house and mainly of the south of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that is why every ball has something romantic."
The first step towards elaboration seems very easy.
Luciano throws the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers in a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the moment cools it up to four degrees.
Then open the tap of the machine and comes out a pasteurized white basic cream, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can the ice cream be made only with natural elements or without swindler?
How can you give free rein to some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises to wake up from the trends of the time.
The one who talks about ice cream "not just natural ingredients," may have used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar rubber, beans.
Of course you can make ice cream without a stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, place it in a bag and the customer will bite a granite icy sound.
Certain variations are allowed in the basic mass.
Scents are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, Master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the sweets section of the supermarket.
Besides, there's dust and pasta.
"All suppliers will try to sneak flavoured ingredients into their merchandise."
"However, you must experience sometime."
Whether with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white dough, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and cocoa powdered with base for all possible chocolate pleasures.
Now the course participants can use the frosts.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic dough, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
They also conduct the same experiment with types of fruit ice cream.
Knowing better doesn't necessarily depend on you having more tofe scent or more fruit puree.
It is not necessary for hazelnut ice cream to know nuts, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group makes the adored kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water and slightly less stabilizer.
First a balanced mix highlights the taste of ice cream, Luciano says.
The production of ice cream is a problem of articriticism: Peach puree is used with a lot of sugar with a lot of sugar, you have to reduce the sugar ratio of the basic recipe.
For lemon ice cream it takes an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano removes a utensil with which he fixes the amount of sugar in the types of fruits (measurement of the winemaker for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately the tables make the bill easier.
Making ice cream requires nothing but physical application, as before.
It not only helps the utensil for the automatic elaboration of the basic mass.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared mixture of ice cream is simultaneously beaten and cooled at below zero.
Still, all the automation stays out of the little paste.
Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his teammates from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if he were a mini-first giant uncontrolled.
"In all the courses," says teacher Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa has infiltrated the industry experimenting with transgenic plants.
This is currently formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which is considered an institute for independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It looks like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well," Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, said in Munich on Wednesday.
Harry Kuiper, the director of Efsa's expert group on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert have also been hired for years at the Ilsi association.
Consortia such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer pay for it.
Kuiper has worked significantly on Efsa's verification standards for genetically modified plants, which puts him in a clear conflict of interest, Then criticizes.
Efsa's provisions are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of Ilsi's situation and mimic the company's deed, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
It is the second time Testbiotech has criticised a collision of interests.
So, recently, a senior Efsa manager went without the support or transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed with that his side.
Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also recently revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which were held by the Office for the General Environment as well as an EU parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data are used, including some in the industry, provided that they are of high and technical quality, are ordered in a report.
Experts working in Efsa are not required to have any contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US.
He calls himself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without Lobby's commission.
In this regard, independent experts, such as Then, criticize the fact that transgenic plants are currently allowed without researching food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not proven.
"We want to know what, for example, makes genetically modified maize in agriculture," says Then.
The current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the entire GM plant, which does not offer reliable results.
"If the risks aren't sought, how are they going to be found?" he asks, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck thinks the same way.
The scientist has been studying the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying, in the US and in Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not usually published.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The trace of the stones
Uli Gsell has gotten some, in total about 400 kilos.
On Monday he was in front of Stuttgart station, with the Tube behind his back.
There were demonstrations
Nevaba.
The story is known: In September the bulldozers arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never the same again: Thousands and thousands demonstrated against the S21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing went rubble.
Rotate in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are relics".
"They must not disappear".
He is excited: "A cheap and poor, simple and natural stone."
As he once said, he has smelled the smoke from cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he's gonna do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trace of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former French Navy ammunition depot, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He has bought everything that results from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be disgrace, grinding the gravel or sent to the dumpster," he says in his office, a wooden house that was once a guard booth.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition company.
He spoke to the enemies of the 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing for the downing.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable thing, when the stones continued to be used.
About 200 S21 foes took the 80-pound mob cut, priced per piece from 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a souvenir but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the woods, the rest long ago it was sold.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could take in the trunk and over.
The stone of Stuttgart of impulse has long become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kruterbeeten.
"This stone is not really special," says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political component."
Ascend to his SUV, he takes a tour of his great 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, interested in computers and finally works with stones.
And he's a stone lover.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
He carries his treasures all over Germany.
He says he is the country's biggest dealer of ancient stones.
Stop it.
In the snow there are artistic chopped sandstone stones.
"They belonged to the bridge of Dresden Marienbrcke," he explains.
Dawn limestone, yellow, warm, he gets excited.
"My dear stone".
The road crosses the forest.
Point out a lot: Red sandstone, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
"Beautiful travertine".
Formerly the mazizos belonged to the Neckarstadion rostrum of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite of Sankt Blasien Church, toba of the Heilbronner hospital.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how he sculpted the stones before and moved them with a simple rigging and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something was destroyed."
He hasn't gotten rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave to do to the stone dealer, as well as quarries, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a stained glass window and a gardener have settled upstairs in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the man who takes advantage of the remains.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue there.
Talent struggle around big potential
Reign an active influx in the buffet.
16 students crowd around the buns, tomato soup and the sweets.
Braunschweig Technical University and carmaker Vokswagen have invited students of mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In some sort of ideas contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn all about Volkswagen.
Rivalizing and in the same way, many companies, like VW, come together in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Their mission: Hire the most talented students from universities as soon as possible, before they enter the labour market and are hired by others.
And since universities do not provide publications on the skills of their students, an attempt is made to glimpse exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium is won over to the talents.
A lady from the staff department distributes pens, gums and folders with the VW logo.
He explains to the excited young talents the internships and the work for students and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle of Braunschweig Technical University takes the project with VW.
He sees advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"In turn, VW can meet students, look closer at the interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers."
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are so directly desired.
"The main point previously was in technical projects," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not they have to announce themselves and, above all, to get a highly skilled workforce.
All students in engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), 40,000 vacant engineering posts were in October.
And, according to the VDI's prognostics, this engineering vacuum will grow even further.
At the audit and advisory firm, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of talent hunting.
It organizes expensive recruitment events, such as the KPMG race, a modern type of yincan, where participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight highly promising students to the U.S. next year.
In addition, participants can look at KPMG's subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the exit.
Only the creme de la regenerame of many participants goes to the U.S.
Universities are increasingly striving to choose and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the mass."
"The simple journey alone fell short of us."
For the talent hunter Dykta the notes give results.
"To this day we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants."
"Some are close to an end, and they want to apply to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also hunting, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, with their work fairs.
"We're trying to get students at the specialty fairs."
"Something about Intersolar," says Sitha Stabe, staff manager for solar technology maker Solarworld.
The Bonner company has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
He knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently, 35 vacant posts appear on the company's website.
"It's being very difficult to fill in the vacant posts."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter path is contact with the university's professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example Freiberg University.
"Teachers advise that you can do internships with us or do your thesis.
No expensive advertising campaigns are being carried out for solar specialists.
That's why the company needs to be promoted with other advantages: Personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium cannot normally offer it," says St.be, the staff officer.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, attendance at children or good possibilities for promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Instituts, Solarworld holds 55th place among Germany's top 100 employers.
The institute draws up an annual list of the best German employment providers.
For what he asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and the environment in it and observes the preconditions of the employees.
The staff manager also expects extra points in his classification by his aspiring workers.
"I think the applicant is particularly at the external classifications of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of Deutsche Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy to earn a good reputation as employers.
He advises his clients more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer goes through the employees themselves," he says.
In sector jargon it is called Internal Employer Branding, also promoting corporate identity within the staff itself.
"Some satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When people are treated well and identified with the company, then you get promotion directly for the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a gang game," Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
No new oil drilling has appeared from the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico in recent years.
The Washington government issued a blunt ban and thereby overturned its previous plans in an unappealable manner.
Also on the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What led to this strict ban, which will be in place for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the oil rig "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the misfortune that cost the lives of eleven workers and caused the biggest environmental catastrophe in the US, President Barack Obama had admitted new drilling in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
Supporters wanted to reduce U.S. dependence on new oil supplies from abroad.
To this day it has not been fully clear of who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of lawsuits.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its findings in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, various peteroler consortia submitted applications for further drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by using tougher controls and stricter safety regulations.
The responsible supervisory authority, which after being accused of corruption charges has fallen into disrepute, is currently being reformed at the root.
Obama announces in parallel that lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the Gulf will be lower thanks to stricter regulation, to date.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the result of the current survey by the advisory firm BDO - ahead of Wednesday's extraction ban.
American Energey Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation."
Investments in new mining projects are being prolonged at the earliest, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
River water is oil maroons, smelling like a gas station: Millions of liters pouring crude oil have shattered the nature in Nigeria's Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and the illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari is fine with it.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassured journalists: "Today enough oil will pass before your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys stranding in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colourful glow of the water, the scene looks almost pretty.
Brown oil stains are not seen floating on the surface.
"He used to take prawns from handcuffs," explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland by a broken pipe.
Fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach fish-filled waters: Which, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most stinking regions in the world.
On the way to the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship's engine removes a brown broth, which dives its hand into the water, will pull out some full of oil.
The roots of the trees of the mangroves rise from the ground like dark liquorice sticks, sadly isolate the palm trees that collide and hang their palms.
In vain are sought flocks of birds, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the barrier of the exterior is silenced, a kind of ghostly calm of a previous paradise with the smell of gas station smells expands in it.
"What happens here is an ecological struggle," says Celestine Akpobari. "We are in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The area of the settlement of the Ogoni is a fierce battlefield for years: Here the first European explorers broke in more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to place his first factory the Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today, companies are banned from returning to Ogoniland: While pumping more than two million barrels of black gold from the entire delta region, three times larger than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction sources and 7,000 kilometres of pipes, oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters stood out steel platforms such as bizarre water sculptures: "Christmas balls" affectionately called the drillers' heads.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
"A head fails every moment," Akpobari says, then flows a constant jet of oil into the water.
According to experts' assessments, more than two billion liters have been poured into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the breakdown of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the largest ecological catastrophes in human history.
Anyone responsible for the long-lasting environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell's consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see the heads about to break and pipes with leaks as the main cause.
In Nigeria, Shell applies mainly low safety standards normally conventional in the world, scientist Richard Steiner reproached the consortium in 2008: "Only pipe defect rates are "above a multiple higher than elsewhere."
One place, which from afar seems forgotten, a workshop full of oil appears under the free sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered with oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to drilling, sometimes arbitrarily strewn on the ground, he flies a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, oil heats up in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the group's boss.
First, the gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the container, later the oil pipe drips and finally salts diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300 litre diesel barrels daily: "It provides us with 34,000 naira," about $22.
Delta residents take advantage of fuel shortages in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of just 40 euros-cent per litre illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers," who tricked the pipeline network that runs through Ogoniland: According to experts, at least 16 million liters of oil are lost a day throughout the Niger delta.
Only a negligible part of the temporary premium material stored is clearly illegally refined: Organized criminal networks, to which politicians and senior military officials also belong, keep the best part in cisterises and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate on whether the environmental catastrophe is rather due to the management of the population or the loose way of production.
"If the oil companies did not behave as invasive and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no thefts, no illegal refineries."
While the conditions of the Ogoni are shattered mainly by Shell to the point that only one deduction from the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, such as the Chinese."
Michael gets nervous.
"It's about time you disappear," says the muscular Elmann.
"The soldiers can come at any minute."
If the army's special unit catches the illegal refiners, they don't threaten to arrest them, if not with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
"This doomed invention has completely torn apart our country," Akpobari says.
Investigators detect dangerous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a big security problem.
In an investigation into a machine that made a forced landing, researchers found a possible factory defect, which can produce "a catastrophic engine failure."
Qantas airline wants to sue engine manufacturer
Qantas Airbus passengers who made an emergency landing in early November were far more lucky than you can imagine: Australian aviation safety authorities perceived a major safety problem in the engines of some A380, and warn of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a cuff connection, cracks can be caused by fatigue or cracks, ATSB officials announced in a report released Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic engine failure."
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among those is the Qantas-Airbus, which had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline launches legal measures against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in Sydney federal court that allowed more legal action against the company.
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the engine brand they have lost parts and its wing is damaged.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be spared.
The Australian researchers announced they will carry out more safety tests on superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security problem has become important enough to inform all those affected.
After the Qantas aircraft emergency landing, the airline kept its A380 fleet on land for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept about three of its 11 A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replenished the engine of an A380 as a precaution.
This double-decker aircraft is the largest passenger plane in the world.
A Nevada across the country causes traffic chaos
Germany totally white: Overnight it has snowed in almost the whole country.
On many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter ice ice cream Germany: All over the country has reached freezing temperatures overnight on Thursday, triggering chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a layer of snow 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited on most motorways and on many streets.
On the A7 at Flensburg, the snow-removers are in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but not ready.
In addition, strong streaks of wind sweep the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) expects live tides with the water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the Baltic Sea coast Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony, the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on motorways and on national roads.
According to the Meteomedia weather service, the red alert is called in S.chsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimeters of freshly fallen snow and cold and strong winds are in charge of swirling it.
There many trucks and cars were trapped during the night.
Also in Saxony Anhalt, police authorities reported major disturbances in the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind crippled traffic and created traffic.
In Thuringia the snowfall affected the A4 and the A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disruption is expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, fallen trees on the lanes or shattered catenary and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, the intercity service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
Firefighters and the rescue service attended to the 165 passengers on the train with wool blankets, food and drink.
Winds with snow sweep the streets.
At Germany's biggest airport, snowy winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokeswoman for Fraport, there are already 40 flights cancelled.
The snow removals are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers stranded at the airport, although there are 400 tent beds prepared for them.
On many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a track crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
A similar accident occurred in the vicinity of Nuremberg due to the snowy streets: Here too a truck was hit at a track crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
A 30-year-old woman also died after she turned around with her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will be getting softer and dust type and therefore swirling on gentle streaks.
But the wind will slow.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank looks for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its symbol: According to one article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Deutschen Bank recently fixed its headquarters: Twin towers were modernised in the Frankfurt bank neighborhood; while bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium looks set to take advantage of the costs of the rewall, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the Financial Times Deutschland states, based on a spokesman.
The spokesman does not name the reasons for the sale in the project.
"We always check whether it is appropriate to own the properties or sell them and then re-list them," he said.
That is why Germany's largest credit institution relinquishes its company's headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investor of a house fund and then made the relevant arrangements to him.
Energy reforms reached figures of approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would mean a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field estimate the value of the newspaper's towers renamed "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
Whether the renovated buildings are sold at a bank fund or to an independent investor has not been revealed today, the spokesman said.
Thousands of people mourning for the deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who died after many explosions in a mine.
The bodies have not yet been found, because security measures remain precarious at the site of misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago, an intense explosion took place at the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced at the site of the misfortune, but found no sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue team was able to go down for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts deduced that there was no chance the miners had survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Family and friends now remember the deceased with a commemorative event.
Ten thousand people have changed with the glittering sunshine at Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island.
They're silent for two minutes.
In homage to the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal items, under clothing and surfboards.
Flags waved at half-mast in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand hoped the miners would return to the surface "of the depths of the earth," John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, told the participants of the commemorative event.
"But they never came home".
"He cannot assume his son's death until he has seen his body," said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the families of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative event.
Miners of British and South African origin were also buried in the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been removed, the scorching temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, Gary Knowles, the top police officer, told reporters.
To hell, warrior.
Does the gore fit in the art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn again explores the boundaries of the genre with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising."
What public will Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when filming "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior imprisoned with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and murders his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators seeking bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and rip out his enemies the guts of their bodies alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, says almost no words throughout the film and the other characters are carried away at most one or two phrases or a couple of painful deadly screams.
Otherwise they shut up and enjoy Scotland's beautiful, terrifying landscapes, which the scenes offer the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for filmmakers grown up and interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has several target groups it's a shame they can't rule out each other.
Director Winding Refn regards his savages and trilogy over drug trafficking hairstyle "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with a little more humor in the mainstream or somewhat less brutality of the art house.
A brain mass and guts that spring cannot deter most followers of art cinema.
Most fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent christening missionaries for interpretable reasons and gets stuck forever in calm and fog before his team arrives in America and shuts up there again.
It's a shame that "Walhalla Rising" hasn't found a film distributor in Germany and is only released on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody facade, a sometimes exciting piece of cinema hides, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a logical action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into film.
And that's why there's no escape for viewers.
Refn is barely a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the gloomy trance sound band knots on his throat, especially the incredible hatred, which from the characters' hearts goes to him.
Only a young blond boy, who supports One faithfully, retains something of innocence, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the single-eye hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior left hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly in the devil's ambassador himself.
He represents doom, but maybe only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to get angry, upset and be surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious earth movements
The nuclear power organization IAEA has new signs of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this issue until controls are allowed.
At midnight from 5-6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets struck a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of Euphrates; the largest and closest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
His name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), dealing with a reactor that Syrians reportedly built with the help of North Korea in the bucket, hidden in a valley leaving the river.
According to information from the CIA's U.S. international intelligence service at the end of April 2008, a current reactor was designed under the name of the nearby kibar very suitable for plutonium production, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique hardly serves other purposes than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from the vicinity or from the inside.
The reactor had been in operation for a short time, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is barely better known than at the time, the riddles became greater over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoir that before the attack the CIA was absolutely certain that Syrians had built a reactor in the-Kibar, but that he saw little indication that there was "a nuclear weapons program" in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only talk about a "supposed reactor," although they consider the CIA's presentation "plausible."
They lack solid evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how safe a reactor was to have a reactor ahead of him, a senior UN diplomat responded in summer in a laudable way that the IAEA has "sufficient material to have questions."
Syrians quickly disposed of the rubble of the alleged "unused military building" and paved the way.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in the-Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, of commercial vendors at the time right after the attack, which must have a higher information value than the CIA presented.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown client, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria always implied that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
The IAEA dismissed it as implausible after the particle analyses.
Damaskus has since refused to discuss the issue, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, controllers are prohibited from a second inspection in the-Kibar and the entrance to the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel is also in strict silence.
"We will never comment," Ehud Olmert, acting prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and "is gradually becoming a serious credibility problem for the authorities," as a senior Western diplomat corresponds to a place at IAEA in Vienna, a serious breach against the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Atomic Weapons, which the IAEA ensures.
The IAEA considers three more equipment as the key to progress in the clarification, which must be "in functional connection" to the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
Inspectors have not so far publicly disclosed what teams are being treated, or what functions they have, or whether they appear suspicious.
According to the newspaper S.ddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has appointed Marj as a-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from the vicinity of the cities located as an intern.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these sites and located a building complex near Masyaf with satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly on or off next to a military base, Syria is prohibited for this reason from entering the three sites to the IAEA.
In Vienna, Syrians are said to fear a record that the US has asked the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alert to the equipment thanks to warnings from the US secret service.
Through satellite photographs, IAEA has indications that material is being moved between the three sites and the cube to the banks of the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the equipment may be "related to fuel production."
But there is "no indication of sensitive activities," uranium enrichment or refurbishment; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should be separated later for bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt as to whether the ruins, the valuable tracks that can be recovered, are in the three places.
As the hundreds of cargo from the ground trucks disappeared, no one has information about where the debris remains.
The IOWO considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located a few kilometers from the-Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, that Syrians recognized in 1998 for its fitness as an area for radioactive waste, unlikely.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review.
But photographs from orbit show Syrians making land movements at the three suspected sites and disposed of large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be a coincidence but it hardly helps to dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector, the IAEA is said to have spent a few months to develop an inspection plan there, which Syrians would allow, in order to maintain the possible military secret, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the inspectors' interest.
Meanwhile, Damaskus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter has not had much urgency, for a couple of months, Glyn Davies, a type of U.S. ambassador, has been holding so-called exceptional inspections, one of the toughest means that the nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who is to propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future," but still hesitates.
This path is very risky: This requires the majority of the IAEA's governing council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected: "What if they don't find anything in the end?"
Love in the Times of War
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie started in the summer with the direction of her still unnamed debut.
She herself has written the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serb.
Not much else is known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumour is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations have been protesting quickly, prompting a few days of planned filming in Sarajevo to Hungary at the last minute.
The film has been shot in Hungary and post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's war victims' organization wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, Jolie told a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
She is not a diplomat, weeks ago the women offered her a meeting in Hungary that she rejected.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
There are no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's position on the issue gives victims enough about the script.
Her organisation, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended dismissing Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that read the script, granted after a strip and loosened a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie was not in spite of everything.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, she is very much involved in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give voice to all the parties involved.
Its content remains vague.
A second synopsis of the film circulates on the net that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the beginning of the war and meet again when she, a Muslim Bosnian, is deported to a Serbian camp in which he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the "victim of rape who falls in love with torturer."
It's sure Jolie's film really starts before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is "unfair and based on misinformation."
Today they can achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script is still on the net illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like far from here.
This afternoon is finally good for the Irish again.
No trace of grief
Instead, the home team dominates its customers in Sweden, Finland and the US.
Fans scream with joy as loud music echoes, hitting the ground with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in the homeowner Cork, because the players throw themselves, and find, pingpong balls to the glasses of beer from a distance of three meters
The bizarre show is called "Beerpong," and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few plane tickets to Las Vegas for the world beerpong championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this bizarre drinking game and discreet computer don't really make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with that, distracting himself from the fulminating question, what the future will hold for him.
Fun in Las Vegas is not in his plans, in January he will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling," he says.
'It's a long way from home and I don't have a job there yet.'
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "from a thrower he got the job of his dreams as an event manager, maybe it's a good sign," the young man says and smiles.
Because of poor prospects at home, two of Tanners' three brothers have already sought luck overseas.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, her brother Colin currently works as an IT adviser in London.
Young people leave: On the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, economics experts and the ESRI social research institute in Dublin predict.
As of 2015, 200,000 migrants are counted.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, comes a migratory wave comparable to that suffered by the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis mainly confuses young people, well-trained Irish people, for whom so far, everything is uphill.
Job losses and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of 30 are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young migrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything sinks."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever can, goes and loses our country and with it a whole generation."
"The last one to close the door".
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish student union, sees a bleak future as the government only engages in montages and no longer offers prospects for the future to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they don't have strategies to get new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
Watch as his colleagues go from unromered practices to the next.
His biggest concern, he explains, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this issue in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a fair that offers a service around the theme of working abroad.
"For those who start working, doing it overseas is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to lead your career," says the manager.
Photos of a boy sporting surfing in Australia and another snowboarding in Canada appear on his website.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleys, but it involves freedom and fun.
For half a year now, Seán O'Donovan knows what it's like to build something somewhere else.
Since there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish comrades in construction in Germany.
Now they're upping a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he will go to Hanover or Berlin, the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only seldom because he works overtime to pay a credit for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, as long ago he stepped on the threshold of his house.
"Will money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
He laughs at something embarrassed and goes for icy rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with manicured gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 per cent funded by a credit.
"They were crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions," he says.
Are you afraid of failing with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have kids I have to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer doesn't like the complaints he often hears today.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, by far, as dramatic as in times past here on the island," he says.
'Working a season overseas isn't the worst thing that can happen, maybe we feel like Irish for the first time.'
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last big economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he came back and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future pending and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He's already worked for a couple of years in London, and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend do well in New Zealand?
But these days there is one thing that worries him very much: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid he might degenerate into a farewell party.
"Just, not too many emotions," he says and gives his beer a big drink.
"He said goodbye, it sounds very distressing".
'We better call it a party to go, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games.'
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support private companies.
Crime generates greater concern than unemployment.
Moreover, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it allows for monitoring changes in attitude in the region.
Two related issues stand out in the results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the relatively lively humour in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in various countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a low 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a major decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents from Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see chart 2).
Some 44 per cent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably higher than the 25 per cent recorded in 2001 (figure 3).
Some 34 per cent said they trusted their country's Congress and 45 per cent trust their government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turbulence in Latin America seriously affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has been maintained during the global financial crisis is probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Moreover, the existence of a stronger social safety net has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only increased marginally in 2009 and has been reduced again this year, to 32 per cent.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see chart 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a general sense of progress.
This sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the polls began, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see chart 5).
Some 31 per cent say that, whether they or a close relative, have been the victim of crime in the past year, a figure that has fallen from 38 per cent last year and is the lowest percentage since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in increased support for private companies and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private companies are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56% (see chart 6).
Some 58 per cent agree that the market economy is the only system to allow their country to develop, up from 47 per cent last year.
It is interesting that 62% of those surveyed in Venezuela think the same (and 80% support private companies), although its leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country with the highest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19 per cent of respondents (compared to 18 per cent last year), followed by the United States (9 per cent, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent versus 11 per cent a year ago).
However, the United States is the country considered most influential by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Waste election
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, it happened in a much worse way than foreigners feared were being feared to help the country go back after its problems.
Votes were cast in the polls, some people voted several times, ballots thrown in the sewers, destroyed polling stations and acts of intimidation.
The polling stations opened hours late.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, roamed the area trying to figure out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the annulment of the elections.
The protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, said they were "a relatively good election in many ways."
Observers for the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said, cautiously, that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The tie is expected to take place in January.
Not all hopes for the election have been lost yet.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition calling for the vote to be invalidated.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has barely any support, if any, has moved on to the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic sweeps the country and more than a million earthquake survivors continue to live in tents, a large abstention is expected.
When the time came, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they failed to do so because of a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity documents, needed to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as has been evident, so do the Haitians themselves.
Moving tiptoes to the center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity rate by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
Still, that he can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's election will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs Fernandez puts aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are inconclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to take over economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as chairman, was in the habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the extra income at its discretion.
In theory, Ms. Fernandez's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened following Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some dissenting members of the Peronist movement in power have clashed with Ms Fernandez.
However, after chaotic sessions in which one deputy punched another in the face and other deputies accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will therefore apply to next year, which will give the president an even greater scope for action when it comes to spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1 per cent, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage requirements of trade unions, put it at about 30 per cent.
Mr Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than control of inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and had INDEC, the statistics institute, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now dictate these policies?
He has convened meetings between the private sector and union leaders.
In addition, officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18 per cent.
The economy has been driven by high prices for Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the momentum to growth achieved with a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for this reason, Ms Fernandez is signalling her wanting to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier in the year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it appears that Ms Fernandez is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped with the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as is customary.
Last month, however, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new price index for national consumption, which seems to be the prelude to the clean-up of INDEC.
It is unclear whether President Fernandez wants to remain in politics when her term ends, given that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If he does, he will need to win the support of the middle class, much of which has grown tired of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer holiday in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If she wants to win other elections, she will have to decide whether or not she repudiates, calmly, many of her husband's policies.
Half hurrah through China
Taiwanese voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the mainland.
What do you think of Taiwan about its great brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 percent of those eligible, went on November 27 to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment by the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become an advocate of sentiment for the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but by little.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, it failed to win a majority of the vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has opted for Taiwan's total independence, won nearly 50 percent of all the vote compared to 45 percent of the KMT.
If it had been the presidential ones, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by about 8 per cent.
For the first time, the PDP tied with the KMT in the municipalities.
In the election you could see the typical elements of Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with banners and light girls in dancing clothes.
Nor was the mysterious attempt to murder of rigor.
Sean Lien, the son of KMT honorary president Sean Lien, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young man straight in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to hurt Lien or take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the PDP leader, the shooting affected the election, sowing suspicions about the PDP and causing voters to lean over the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the issue of the continent itself was not addressed.
Instead, the candidates talked about public accommodation and job creation plans.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and detests China's military threat.
As a result, the KMT often avoids publicizing its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time the PDP also avoided encouraging anti-China sentiment.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr Ma, for his part, said it had been confirmed that his policy towards China was acceptable to most Taiwanese.
The Beijing government is expected to continue to bribe them with trade, in line with its strategy to get Taiwan back to the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare for a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly also like to achieve political integration, but the first thing is the first thing.
It will be best to wait for the 2012 presidential election to pass.
In any case, the PDP has reinvented itself.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was jailed on corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he openly instigated explicit independence.
But under Ms Tsai's leadership, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PDP is struggling to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been welcomed as a PDP candidate for the presidency, as has her Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything it can to show that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms Tsai announced plans to set up a group of experts to act as a point of contact between the PDP and China, provided that negotiations can be conducted without preconditions.
Ms Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party represented a "reliable alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr Chen seems angry at the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said PDP candidates would have come out better if they had insisted Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to present the presidential elections.
Even without Mr Chen interceding, the PDP will have difficulty choosing from its potential candidates.
The KMT must also do a conscience test.
Mr Ma's ratings have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Their lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says it will restructure its cabinet as well as local teams.
Large samples from the PDP suggest Taiwan's support for a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the Artist Revelation category.
Act at the request of a president and people will probably look at you.
Hope Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at her Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, was one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Revelation Artist.
Given that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Hope," the nomination gives us what to think about, but respects the Grammys' rules that he must be an artist who hasn't released more than three albums to the market before recording the one who "determines the public identity of that artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society," certainly a breakthrough and, given his light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with pop, funk and Latin rhythms, you can at least draw a distinction between Spalding and the path to Norah Jones' success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammys voters, who have recently focused on the jazz realm for this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity," an exciting and magnificent album that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer's competitors is veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a strident favorite in New Orleans and a regular guest on HBO's "Treme," was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which for the rest leans heavily towards fusion as on the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's wild punk's wild Argue's Secret Society earned a well-deserved recognition in the big group category, competing against the big camera jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the ever-risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his ot, "Pathways," was a great example of the bassist's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in best classic album direction
Nominations in the field of classical music for the 53rd edition of the Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," by piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse," an eclectic orchestra work of three movements.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California are Estonian composer Arvo P.rt for his symphony No 4, "Los Angeles," a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
The nominations for classical music are distributed in thirteen categories covering orchestra albums, opera, choral and solo.
The classic producer category of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for the Symphonies No 3 and No 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" by several artists; and the "Requiem" of Verdi of ChicagoSymphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" of the Royal Opera House orchestra; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan for "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchesof Wales.
Songwriters nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include P.rt for Symphony No 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionately Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Symphony No. 4 of P.t. premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The roughly 30-minute piece is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"It composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms of North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the orchestra function category, for directing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists nominated are pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergoman.
In the classic mixing category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The mosque proposed in Temecula gets approval from the commission of the
The Temecula mosque project has won unanimous support from the local commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the bill, saying it encourages terrorism and traffic jams.
However, committee members decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local legislation and would be impressive from an aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Baha &apos; is of all religions," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I am proud."
"It shows that justice prevails".
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"They just talk too loud".
"There are wonderful people in this valley".
The meeting began at six o'clock in the afternoon and lasted almost midnight; most of the time it was dedicated to people who interceded for or against the center, practically the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"The United States no longer exists," reads one of the comments.
"This is another Planet of the Apes with Mrs Libertad dead in the sand."
"America has fallen".
Plans for the construction of Islamic centres have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near zero zone, the New York area where the attacks of 11 September 2011.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has reported acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been living smoothly in Riverside County for years, but he wanted more and better space than the warehouse he rented on a shared property with a manufacturer of water filtering systems.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It occupied a 4,32 acre area on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the City Council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new ways of life on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new ways of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although the researchers discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that there may be life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or arsenic."
"That makes it very peculiar, although it lacks little to be a really 'alienient' kind of way of life," Paul C said. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appears in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
For a long time, there have been six major essential elements for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, researchers have discovered that the bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, may continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"It makes you think about how much is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar from Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on planets other than Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the convening of a press conference to discuss it, at which no details of the discovery were disseminated, generated great speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report indicated the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't do it.
What the discovery "yes shows is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider indispensable to life may not be so fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the investigation team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the replacement of one element with another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's astrobiology institute, which led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from a chemical point of view, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus."
"Therefore, it may be difficult for organisms to differentiate them."
"However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work as well as phosphorus, so it comes in and, to put it in some way, it appeals to biochemical machinery," explains Anbar.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they managed to adapt and used to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can show that it can live with arsenic in its place raises the possibility that there may be a natural existence of arsenic-using form of life, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
- Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be replaced with phosphorus is not new, but no one example had been found to show that it works.
Arsenic was more common in the early ages of Earth, he said, so researchers speculated that the first life forms may have used it.
"Yes, it suggests that there could be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in the past," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The stolen dogs missing in Compton have been found
The two missing dogs of the four stolen have been found outside the Bellflower motel, Los Angeles County sheriff's officials said Thursday.
The four racing dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, went missing on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van in which they were spending the night, in front of the Bellflower Motel 6, according to authorities.
Two of the canines recovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two were found Wednesday night, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape".
"They've come back to their rightful owners".
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood, nor the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't want to say anything," Whitmore said.
"We're following some clues".
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to make any comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akites at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not been damaged.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to showcase at the competitions in the area this week on behalf of the Japanese owners of the dogs, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to showcase Trace.
The other dogs were to be exhibited in other competitions scheduled for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple's nearly two-month tour by participating in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard did the check-in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of the window of their room.
They carried three other dogs (a boxer's brood, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick coat and would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van theft on Tuesday at 6 a.m.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday it was unclear whether or not a reward would be given.
Lion ready to roar again, while MGM restructuring gets final court approval
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM has finally got the green light to start over.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the "pre-prerogated" plan by creditors to wipe out about $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and premiere of films and television shows.
Thursday's ruling confirms that the plan meets the demands of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal hurdles for MGM to relaunch under Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the chief executives of what will be a reduced study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320.
In fact, MGM won't be leaving Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million credit facility to fund the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded in mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to provide advice on the management needed to order its finances, as it struggled to make interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron chairman and bankrupt business recovery expert, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial tribulations and satisfy the studio's more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, in late 2009 the parties agreed to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion the creditors sought.
Before spring this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was eventually backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper's companies will receive multimillion-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will get a $9.5 million payment.
Cooper's companies, which have been raising $375,000 a month for their company management services, will receive a $4 million "successful honorary."
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which premiered only one film this year, and collected an annual slate of seven or eight films that will be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit," along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share of the two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18 per cent of MGM's debt, had been trying to fix a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies did not result in a deal.
Tech Toys wants to keep balance of its gift budget
While the iPad is the main candidate to be this year's most wonderful toy, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant dent in their gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bikes of 99 dollars each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes adorned with beads, or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy sellers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law has been working; this year's technology toy will likely have more power, costing the same and even slightly less compared to last year's.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the best known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button-driven toys are increasing, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and over) are stuffed toys the size of a cobayo that sing a note when their bellies tighten.
A squeeze equals a note, and a second squeeze starts putting together a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start squeezing, you can't stop.
For singing combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and over) is the best option.
Borrowing from last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays shift-change games like Simóm Dice, and can make the moon step, thanks to its innovative wheel-articulated feet with locking device.
The children who tested the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you're a 1980s kid, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and over), with a backpack full of question cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with an eye-catching self-correction workout notebook.
If you are wary of giving your child your smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although the games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, from 3 to 12 years), it is the first important set of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, 3-7) uses an iTunes system to present games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30,000, Hasbro, for eight years and over) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a matchbox, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to put words by putting the blocks in line before the weather runs out; it's formidable for a makeshift punctual contest.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
Based solely on their presence in toys, the two biggest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, 6 to 12) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you exchange the code online, your child gets enough credit in the Penguin Club store for two items.
These could include wheeled skates or a Puffle mascot toy.
Slightly bigger than the bristle of her toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and over) is the latest in a line of microrobots powered by button batteries.
The fake insect moves quickly on 12 rounds of vibrating silicone in random directions.
It's fun to make a block maze to see if you can find the way out.
It's also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend some time inside our dog's mouth.
Promotes a more moderate side of order maintenance in China
As an urban sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the passage in a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people in his care, issuing orders quietly with military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan, the corpulent police of the urban order of China, feared and despised for their whimsical strong measures and their inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Firms".
"Attention".
"Show them," he whispered, "How are the pretty girls?"
Four girls who barely spent their teens wearing white gloves and identical olive green jackets and tight trousers to get attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats placed perfectly on top of hair tied with blue and white striped buns.
"Personally, I think they look normal," Mr. Tang, contemptuously.
"The models are cute".
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a grade title.
Guangdong Province changed the greyish green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating glances: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a deciquatic snacks cart, and watched it with a frown constantly frowned for half an hour, until the street vendor picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 in Chengdu, has chosen a radical makeover.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police, expressly chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the rough cop a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's tiny respect for these city squads.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors from Hubei Province beat down a passerby after using his cellphone to film them while they were dissolving a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for inspectors in Beijing was stolen and posted on the Internet, describing how effectively whipping criminals without making them bleed.
Earlier this year, a Shanghai watermelon street vendor suffered brain damage after a scuffle with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available to download online, features Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan has left a scar on government," lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a really meticulous clean-up."
Skeptics say the current approach is far from this.
After the district requested eight new female recruits in October through a notice, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News asked whether women had real duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district's warning called for female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features."
They should have above average height, more than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the work was physically too arduous for women over 25 years of age.
"His image is the important thing," an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities."
Female chengguan are like vases, she said, adding, "in addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city's administration office, is not eager to back up that description.
But he noted that height demands were standard in many Chinese job warnings for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means being handsome, it's a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely the disabled or disfigured should not be presented.
"We cannot allow a cook or a hunchback person to come to work here," Mr Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be right".
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with his cheeks and subtly curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent on her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His co-worker with dimps, Xu Yang, 21, said "Our job must present the image of the city."
They also don't oppose their work on time, they said, because they harbour career ambitions that simply scare away vendors in the alleys where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squad faces about a dozen street vendors who launch themselves on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as many buns or bowls of tofuge as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to go".
"We've told him many times," Ms. Xu said as a salesman escaped on foot, temporarily abandoning his bike-throwing car with noodle garrisons.
Officers describe his duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
"This is pretty much the same every day," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in his spare hours.
"Very routine".
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the merchandise of vendors.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy, which are commonplace across China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, mutined after the false rumor spread that Chengguan officers had murdered a salesman.
More than a dozen police officers or Chechen officers were injured in the nighttime episode; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
For now, Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike shouted rudely.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, made their way to the elbows to their vehicles and left quickly with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the men's squad, remained behind, with his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female officers, the coordinators, men 40 and older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to keep an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally".
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said naturally.
"Most of the time it's the public who start the fight."
Prosecutors will not press charges against Senator Ensign
The senator's lawyers announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have absolved Senator John Ensign of the criminal charges that emerged from his affair with a former campaign aide and his efforts to secure lobbying for the woman's husband.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair made national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said he was "surely happy" with the decision, which came after a full-year investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department had "informed that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of his investigation and that he has no plan to bring charges against him on this issue."
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign may have colluded to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents that were first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his aides, to obtain lucrative work by lobbying, to secure the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Ms Hampton once worked as treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political backers to find Mr Hampton's job and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an aide to Ensign, he was excluded under the lobbying law for his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, came at odds with the so-called "revolving lobbying ban," which seeks to restrict former state employees using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, "it seemed to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving statute," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared cautious in accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for its public integrity section, including last year's decision to drop out of prosecution against former Sen. Ted Stevens, amid charges of misconduct.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowardly," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws don't apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's lead attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor Monday and another call the next day, telling him the department did not want to press charges against his client.
Ensign's defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable going into detail about my discussions with the Justice Department, I can only say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which alleges that a $96,000 payment from Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal electoral law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, which got a lobbying job thanks to the help Ensign gave to Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him he was "shocking" the Home Office on a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the transportation secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair surfaced last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign's spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said the senator expected the ethics committee to quickly follow the Justice Department's example and conclude its investigation.
"Senator Ensign is keen to continue his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire appeal will target Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "kicking" in the ranks of the courtroom.
Minutes by minute, they sent reports of the gruesome testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the process widely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, is set to reach an official end, with the death penalty judge cast by the jury.
But Mr Hayes' lawyers have filed briefs in court outlining the arguments of the appeals that are likely to take to court for years.
One of the most provocative claims that intense reports about the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created "a circus atmosphere," and such widespread and immediate saturation with exalting details made public passions exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force appeal judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"Depending on what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual's rights to have a fair process," Thomas J. said. Mr. Hayes's chief defence lawyer Ullmann.
Trial Judge Jon C. Blue, of the state High Court, latched the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying the news media were "carefully controlled" and there was no evidence the jury had been carried away by the passion.
But it probably won't be the last word on the subject.
For decades, the appellate courts have recognized that coverage of cases can raise questions about the fairness of a process.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the Sheppard vs. case. Maxwell, who had "a carnival atmosphere in the process" because of the media.
The crime is believed to have been inspired by the TV show and the movie "The Fugitive."
Some lawyers said the appeals courts, which examined Mr Hayes' conviction half a century later, might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr Sheppard's case.
"There is a general concern about the impact of new media" on high-profile processes, John J. said. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the Connecticut death penalty and wrote a report that said it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appeal judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many of the issues outlined by Hayes' lawyers, who are likely to be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense attorneys also say, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to testify to the reactions of potential jurors, showing them creepy photographs of the crime scene during jury selection.
Jurors have said they were horrified by photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and their daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense attorneys say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and that he had incorrectly pressed for a verdict for his bizarre decision to order the jury to deliberate over the weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of intense coverage of the process can attract most of the interest.
They noted in a recusal of the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continually thundered the fire of emotion about the case.
"The daily agglomerations of the media, the cameras and reporters out of court," the lawyers wrote, "was something never seen here in New Haven and maybe across the state."
His attention to Tweeter's coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said the complaint about the fact that immediate news was more important than the reports delivered more slowly, was a ludite vision that would make the court's policy on controlling coverage weak in future trials.
But some lawyers said the appeals courts were often attracted to arguments about adaptation that was required in court because of social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In his brief, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which overturns Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the coverage of the process, and made it clear that they would require the new media to require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard vs. case. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civility build a bridge to unite divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invective and negativity, this week has sparked some civility in Washington.
Is it a harbinger of genuine bipartisan future cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders did not produce any progress on the big issues to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But from what everyone says, it was at least a polite discussion about the differences of the two sides, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to earn partisan points.
Wednesday's public meeting of the president's deficit committee was equally civilised, despite the remaining political differences between members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide that still separates members.
That's hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has come.
Both sides are now in a probationary period, probing each other to identify signs of cooperativism and commitment, as they try to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
Reason why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent evaluations of it by participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and are too deeply rooted to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, expenses, healthcare or social assistance, the two sides are at opposite poles.
Still, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There's no doubt that things have changed with regard to the way things are said," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
"They are inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse party passions, which are then extinguished.
That's good".
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a compromise to expand unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans can't make them believe they favor tax cuts for the wealthy, denying unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, there is greater optimism about a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) pact.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns that successful cooperation on pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112th. Congress meets Jan.
Instead, he said that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement will begin.
"After the things that need to be done are carried out, in the short term psychology will reverse the situation to one of confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civility can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and Tea Party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As aware as Republican leaders have about the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know they must try to keep their promises to cut state spending and override the new health care law.
These party lines are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the deficit commission's recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes and the retirement age, and cutting spending.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken care of one of the toughest jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forcibly introduced the deficit issue to the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the elected officials on the panel, suggesting that in fiscal matters there are, at least now, few bases or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between White House Republicans and those of Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of party clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of heightened bipartisan cooperation.
What would change bring about?
The public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as happened in 1995, then both parties will watch the reaction of people carefully.
Whoever they think is losing is likely to change course and seek compromise.
However, this may be an optimistic vision.
Partisanship and polarization are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a bigger ideological gap between Obama and congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilism shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort from both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked American document portrays Moscow as the paradise of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a "cleptocracy," and leaves a portion of the bribes and protection money it collects directly from the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in February.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service are reportedly handling huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Every stratum of the bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical authority," takes its share as the money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a clean-up since.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have consistently denied corruption allegations over the years, and he has won several libel lawsuits over such accusations.
In September, when asked on a Russian television channel about a documentary that suggested he was corrupt, he said: "It's crazy, a hoax, an annoyance."
According to polls, Russians overwhelmingly believe their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy's report, and it is unheard of that it is the diplomats of a foreign country who do that.
"The direct links of the Moscow city government with criminality have led some to call it 'dysfunctional', and to claim that the government functions more as a kleptocracy than a government," the note says.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and the mafia that literally means "roof" or protection) that passes over the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts identify a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top".
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas because the city does not provide some services."
The report says the SFS raises the money from the largest companies, and that police are targeting small businesses.
One source, the report said, "explained that Moscow's commercial owners understand that it is best to get the protection of the MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no more a priority."
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, protection can be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who don't pay quickly find their businesses closed for one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports on men taking suitcases, probably filled with cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem's Moscow expert group, said in a recent interview.
"But he is a part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country ranked 154th (countries are ranked as at least the most corrupt).
The revelation of the note from the U.S. Embassy, which did not happen until late at night Moscow time, will surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and although Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that the WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted angrily to a revelation that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
'But to be honest with you, we don't suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, it was done in such an immoral way.'
Red Khmer veterans forced to face past
In a concretely lighted classroom, with stained and husked walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"Here everyone loves Ta Mok".
"He was a good leader and cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the Butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge government, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge fortress in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-held loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that first teaches the Red Khmers' history to the sons of their former soldiers.
And in July, a joint United Nations and Cambodia court issued the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, sentencing the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of those events, anxiety has grown among Anlong Veng's Red Khmer Rouge veterans, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they can't do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within families."
During the rule of the Cambodian Khmer Rouge, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese in 1979 invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-led government, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a U.N.-sponsored peace deal led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the government, culminating in the 1996 rifts of Ieng Sary and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest fighters of the Khmer Rouge fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local administrative positions in exchange for laying down their weapons, the satin soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
"These people have made little profit after surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised without any circumstances to do business."
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before dedicating himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Khmer Rouge was fine," he said.
"Ta Mok fed everyone".
"But now life is difficult because we have to self-supply."
The current Khmer Rouge court has also raised concerns here.
Earlier next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court's mandate is to prosecute the main leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but he has not said whether he will pursue cases in addition to those four.
This doesn't do much to calm fears at Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told investigators at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced labourers are thought to have died.
On a recent embarrassing afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden piles on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows over the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Khmer Rouge.
She said if the court called her she would not stand.
"Cambodia is in peace and stable," he said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war".
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is just what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk, of the documentation center.
"The reconciliation, according to the conflict, is to re-unite the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The center produced the government's first textbook on the Khmer Rouge, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea," 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's high school history textbook, which contains less than four pages of the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's bond with the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court," he said.
"They have suspicions because they are not sure about the number of people the court will try."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are starting to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge retains a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too many weeds and covered in discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of black soot covered by a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cellphone salesman on the side of the road, said he didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray," he said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot's last break, where he would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope of having good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stockpile of uranium qualified for weapons
In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the Belarus government announced Wednesday that it will give up its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement released after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it seemed they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a pair of classified operations were carried out with Belarus in the past two months to remove 84.82 kg of weapons-qualified uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
That paved the way for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material, about 227kg, according to an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the matter.
The deal appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was apparently a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This shows that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Society, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the deal is "a very significant and important step" taken by Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material around the world over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be seventh.
A dozen countries did so under George W. - Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have retained highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically uranium qualified for weapons) and low-enrichment uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
'This is our raw material... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone.'
"We use it for research purposes, that's all".
But Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, signalling interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly radiated.
Officials said he was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 2,000 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was carried out by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with the installation of low-enriched uranium research, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official who works on Global Threat Reduction, said "this was coordinated and orchestrated with great care to strengthen trust" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of weapons-qualified uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will seek to remove its reserve by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential detente.
It stated that "while progress on these global security issues is welcome, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential to the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Spanish government did not object to CIA flights
The Spanish government did not object to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners heading to Guantanamo on Spanish territory, the US ambassador to Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in the leaked documents (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, which adds that the then first vice president of the government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they were carrying out appropriate surveillance on foreign planes passing through Spain."
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries of complicity in human rights practices, including Spain, a meeting between former US ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega took place.
The vice president acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Zapatero government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "saved pickles," Aguirre says on a cable.
Also the then head of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the government had a limited capacity for influence."
For his part, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he would not try to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements or any sensitive information," the embassy explained after speaking to the prosecutor.
However, the US reflected its concern about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors," rather than the declassified information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments," Aguirre laments.
In March 2007 at a lunch between the U.S. ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he told him that "although Spanish judges are rabidly jealous of their independence and will do whatever they deem appropriate," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The ambassador also expresses his concern about the action of the PP in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. government," he says.
The confessed parricide complained on the "August" network of being a mother
The young woman spoke about the boy when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror the Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the net.
With this nickname, which she has used since she was little, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two natives of Noia, the people of Coruñés from which she is native.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know his sentimental life, which ABC reconstructs through testimonies of his relatives.
The 30-year-old Galician woman began a relationship in 1998 with Ivan Túñez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left him, it was soon known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get tested for DNA.
It didn't take long to meet him another engagement.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
With him he came to live together for a long period.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her for a week to Palma.
But from the content of the communications, it is seen that their romance fractured, which they broke.
In March 2008 she's in Menorca, alone, and she writes: "Alberto is very weird and musked, because I've come to work."
'When I told him it was okay, but of course, he now realises what it's like to be with the kid all day and not have the freedom to do whatever he wants.'
Then he talks about a message to the mobile phone he just received: "I want you to go back this month or give me an address to send the child."
She complains: "If you don't like me leaving the kid with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back," he says.
In May, he talks about the return to his village: "This week I'm going to go there, but I'll only be until I'm 19, because on the 20th I have to introduce myself to a job so I don't lose it."
He clarifies that if everything goes well, he takes his firstborn.
"It's going to be with who you should, that is, with me, and I'll never think of leaving it again with anyone other than my mother," a dubious intention given her bad relationships.
In July, there's another post.

Monica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, from the juvenile court detainment centre.
The ex officio lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the events took place, "nor had any intention of causing any harm to the minor."
Before, he did confess that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his body in a suitcase.

Populars would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies experienced in the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP already has its sights on the general elections because, whether or not there is progress, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation obtains in these elections usually doubles the one it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 general elections, while in the 2006 regional elections, the figure amounted to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the CFP won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, which has been nourished by a transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the CFP could go from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU also won four (now it has 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 deputies (it has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose one deputy - now it has three - while ICV would stay with a deputy or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will take place in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in its relay at the head of the Diputación de Barcelona, one of the administrations that manages the most budget - 661 million euros by 2011.
Both nationalists and popular agree on the possibility that the PSC would lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get a majority or possibility to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be crazy if this formation loses its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its vote figure in the four capitals and could be decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to lead the overturn in the Tarragona capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has been located only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
Popular people have also grown up in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to list lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerian detainees detained by officers of the General Police Information Station in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, provided passports to different Al Qaeda groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the latter perpetrator of the Bombay attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with the "Bampai operation" the Al Qaida counterfeiting apparatus at the international level and, "therefore, its operational capacity" has been "weaken."
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then distributed to groups that make up the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" can cross the European and other Western countries with total impunity.
The detached cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operational in Europe, hence the investigations have participated, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, so it is not ruled out that in the next few days strikes similar to that carried out last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), in Thailand another developed with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones who ran from Bangkok the cell based in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly robbed tourists who met the requirements of the so-called "World Islamic Front."
That is, the documents were to be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years old, valid for several years and without stamped visas.
The media point out that, for the time being, no information has been found to link those arrested in Catalonia to the Bombay attack, despite the fact that the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba," has been one of the groups receiving passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia about a thousand dollars were sent through a transfer agency that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that killed 106 people.
Police have seized extensive documentation.
The PP demands Mas to park the tax concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and which is summed up in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and dispense with filo-sovereignist adventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to propose in the equator of his mandate.
The president of the popular Catalans attended the meeting of Artur Mas with the security that gives him to have obtained 18 deputies in last Sunday's elections, a figure more than enough to be loved, since the CiU candidate needs that at least one of the formations that the opposition will exercise to abstain in the investiture vote.
The future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held depends on a possible agreement with the PP, but, for the time being, the talks that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are taking place in Catalan key.
And as far as the president of the PP is concerned, to support an investiture "we will have to park all the sovereignist and independence speeches," as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader intends to even submit to referendum.
Both leaders do have in common their commitment to thin the political apparatus of a highly inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of the inheritance and donation tax.
The details of the negotiation on the investiture of Mas will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
Owners of downtown Olot don't rule out their warden killing more than 11 elderly
Those responsible for the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while there was an employee, killed at least eleven elderly people in his care.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the center, lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat's wish would be able to prosecute the person responsible" for the deaths but "legality and responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civil liability."
In addition to the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the warden, the great threat to La Caritat now takes on the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the families of the victims are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has since not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the order ordering the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatrician - who suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, taking into account the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was dispatched by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, flatly denied this point yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures cannot have been at any time the cause of what has happened."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is not a single indication in the case that there has been a reckless action by anyone other than the defendant himself."
The one already called "Angel of Death" confessed the day before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 for, a month and a half later, to kill a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused death by an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed by helping with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the center have access to the medicines.
Insulin punctures and the sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his eagerness to alleviate the suffering of inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the tests that are being done in the laboratory that will have to clarify whether Vila does not lie and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, he burned them inside giving them bleed as he has already confessed to what he did with the three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the warden's demonstrations, not even the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out that it is superior, and justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has changed his way of proceeding after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say that they are made available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday warning "markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity."
Peripheral spreads have closed strongly and shares in European banks have risen more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to make a mistake and the euro has barely rebounded, which is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that, as it collapses, recovers but motivated by closing short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will take time to lose fear.
A month ago the ECB summoned us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded to complete the plan to buy public debt as ineffective and eliminate all extraordinary forward liquidity measures and leaving only unlimited access to week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect them to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also expect them to continue their bond-buying program and even signaling to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they remain obstinate in withdrawing liquidity measures, may God assist us.
As at their May meeting where they said they had not even contemplated the purchase of bonds and the markets collapsed, history could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, he announced the bazuca on Monday and on Wednesday said he had already bought a lot, causing a further collapse of the market.
Yesterday the one-year-old auction of letters in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28%, versus 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still, rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been made public.
The estimated figures are about $10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potential and have until February to raise private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are assumed within the Help Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to get parliamentary approval for its new budget and does not yet have sufficient support, so Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to relax tension in the run-up to the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, in which there is a need for a political commitment to show that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the anthem of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the president had the gift of opportunity when he presented yesterday the plan of measures to be approved on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors such as the four stations in Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Banco de España has been swift and blunt and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will be resolved with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Help Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in liquidity available three times as much as in March, at very expensive rates and closes access to the markets without it.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's wife, "in addition to being, it seems so."
Cheer up, we can.
Eulen's president will challenge Vega Sicilia's board of his children
The storm does not diminish in the open conflict in the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, considering it "full-fledged," the judicial board of El Enebro on the 16th, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the firm head of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation for control of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services to the company does not appear willing to give in to his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was stripped by five of his seven children who appointed themselves administrators at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year and whose challenge is recorded in the Commercial Registry.
The judicial board of El Enebro for the 16th, convened by the judge of the Commercial Number 2 of Madrid, has again opened the box of thunder within the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to establish the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the board.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate appeal of the applicants their five children to, through procedural argument, in clear fraud of Law and abuse of rights, try to validate and heal the radically null meeting on January 18," according to its official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for the Board, once the board has been held, to proceed with its challenge on the grounds that it is "full-fledged."
The same protagonists, who remain discreetly silent, have already tried unsuccessfully to have the judge convene a board in June.
In El Enebro, a property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's seven children control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group, however, claims the usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This matter is the substantive issue to be decided by the judge once the hearing on the challenge is held, for which there is still no date set.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret Siemens weapon
Software designs real-time car upgrades.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into account the options of a newly arrived team and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final straight of the championship they all bet on the triumph of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without deserving the ability as a driver of the finally champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor of the capacity of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German put on the market in 2007 for purposes far from high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design assembly chains of manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, to faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable failures and expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and implement "in a few hours, almost in real time," the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during the races and in the trials.
Russwurm explains that the squads in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four vehicle improvements during each season.
Today 180 young high-skilled professionals work in the Red Bull team who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyse and project all sorts of modifications to the fireballs.
The manager of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull's fireballs with the exception of the engine, which is of Renault's sole responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be brought from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this technological improvement madness is the figure of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend maximum on each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its fireballs in a town about 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret."
The template for this task amounts to 580 people, including its two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's Formula One hero is undoubtedly the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drinks brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits are hidden, other protagonists hide whose contest is invaluable and its null and voidness.
The factory's head of technology, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R&D advances in cart cars contributed 50 per cent of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and the technology adds 85% of the success, while pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer science because they "are unpredictable gladiators."
HP will install in two years its own stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened yesterday in Barcelona its first exclusive store in collaboration are its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first in the network of 20 shops of between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will reconcile this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP España, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the remodeled shop located on the Gran Vía Barcelonaa, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has collaborated for 30 years.
The American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems also assured that the philosophy to install the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The American group advises and is responsible for the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be played interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in the purchase, care, after-sales and even packaging."
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering pilot program worldwide that is responsible for solving the possible problems of HP computer equipment in guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Dutch).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, since large companies already have hired technical assistance services," Helena Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'stealing' a million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other directors, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for the bank, but initially dismisses a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse in interest margins, which will be sought to compensate in part with increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell hopes to attract in three years a million private clients, his pending subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new master plan in 2011 that will be valid for three years.
The aim, in addition to surviving without the need to resort to public aid from the FROB, is to gain market share with the recruitment of one million new private customers - 700,000 if those who can leave the bank are discounted - their large pending subject, since so far it had pampered SMEs and companies more than the retail customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or the same, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, and whose challenges will be set by the bank when it presents the results of the financial year.
Few banks dare at this time to set targets and make them public as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of global banking.
Sabadell will, in fact, close its Optima master plan, set four years ago this year, although initially it was for three, but the market situation caused it to extend it one more year.
Customers who let the savings banks slip will be their main target.
At a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs," something fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And while he believes that the liability war - which penalizes margins - is falling, the price of risk premiums that banks and banks are paying for their issues to obtain liquidity are already moving to the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it's going to be a pressure factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the tap, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto already gave orders Thursday to his network to limit long-term credit and raise the price of spreads - see CincoDays on November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the banking trend now "is to raise commissions," but "there is a competitive framework."
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he says that in Spain "larges will be required."
"Everything is going to move next year," he said.
He states that the capital needs are "high-high" and does not rule out any Spanish financial institution entering red numbers.
And he points out that the FROB can supply the market in raising funds for new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, he downplayed what some bankers already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through repos, which dampens the crisis.
ECSC rules out a second wave of mergers in the banks
The CEO of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that there will be a wave of mergers of savings banks and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, several entities assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations will take place.
"I think the biggest part of the mergers has been made, Cajasol's incorporation into the Civic Banking group cannot be said to be a second round, what there are are adjustments."
"Most of it is completely done; instead of 17 we will go to 13 or 14 but all the big processes have already been done and protected by the Banco de España, which in that has collaborated very much as well," said the manager.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has stated that the process of concentration is being undertaken "at the fastest possible, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is happening in the deadlines that in their day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Banco de España," he emphasized.
"Moving from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion active volumes to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that is unparalleled in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to comply with Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a rather unlucky series of opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense," because "what the Banco de España does is remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year."
The CEO of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who call it a "lack of knowledge."
The manager pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a "very important" concentration process and that "will go as fast as possible."
He also recalled that the Spanish bank went out very well stopped from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoemaker and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have prompted a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or the abolition of 426 euros of aid to unemployed without benefit, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to unleash the current crisis.
How do you interpret those movements?
Go ahead that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another twist in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of a large part of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second is the recovery of the framework, although now it seems like science fiction, with a very favorable stream of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals of greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the transgressive countries, possible suspensions of payments of some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defining for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government pulled out of its sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be made (plans of fiscal rigour and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the front was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully extended Greece's rescue decision.
Already then it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the published one were very much against Greece's bailout.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union's treaties, in order to make it possible to rescue a country and, at the same time, force private lenders to bear some of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should assist in the process of reforming the Union that will enable those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, although measures must now be taken with which he may not agree very much, from that date the old operation of the euro will have been completed.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the infringing countries will be severely punished, they can be forced to declare themselves in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear some of the cost.
Germany is pointing out to us that we must follow a severe growth path with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, simply will not tolerate it.
The envy is clear.
And we would do wrong not to understand.
It is not just a question of redirecting the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they demand of us is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give way to greater tranquillity.
And let's take advantage of the window of opportunity they have given us, until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel, the thesis has been opened that order must be put at home.
But the red line Germany has drawn there is, and it doesn't look like they're going to move it.
And, among the possibilities envisaged, that of leaving a monetary area too crowded from unserious countries, it cannot be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.
Sport and fraud of law
Trees like those of Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax show wit but no will to escape a sanction.
The expulsion allegedly devised by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match played on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about whether or not such behaviour is unsportsmanlike and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, within a few minutes to finish the game (which their team already clearly had won), the two players deliberately lost time when it came to taking faults to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will already finish as leader of their group, both players will serve the regulatory sanction the next league match, against the Auxerre, and will be able to pass clean cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two games, and the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or the like is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the reported case is due to the fact that it has been starred by a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in its anthem boasts of nobility and honor, and that in past times it has fined its players for similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his long history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behaviour not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, if these actions commit fraud of law; since, in fact, they are actions that respect the sports regulations, but seem to avoid their meaning.
The question involves examining the kind of damage they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the assets that understands the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not endangered, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these assets referred to with fair play is to prevent the team of the offending players from taking unfair advantage of the opposing team, which did not happen either.
However, the paradoxical thing about the action of the Real Madrid players is that it did not conform to what we normally characterize as cheating or fraud of law, because their violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely their action tried to be the most evident in order to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage offenders get in the intentional misdemeanour examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that the rival is not disadvantaged or profited in the same match, because obviously the result of the action means leaving the team itself with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, as the club won't be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously, is that the players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, as the team can be eliminated at the first change, and in addition with this performance the players fulfill a penalty match and move on to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension for card accumulation occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, if you go rounds, it's not so clear it's an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions do not go against the sporting spirit, of which it is part of to make strategic decisions that favor to make the most of what the rules allow.
In the case at hand, the players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (this would be a clear case of fraud of law), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without overcoming the punishment or fleeing it.
Although the border between ingenuity and law fraud is diffuse, on this occasion I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises by two factors: because it was two self-expulsions and the way in which the transmission of the guideline was carried out to provoke them.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to capture group Christmas dinners in BCN
This year's dictatorship of the calendar concentrates an avalanche of reservations for 16th and 17th.
The self-suffering celebrations by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros, proliferate.
Like the nougat and the lottery, with the arrival of December, the group dinners before Christmas also return, which continue to act as an oxygen balloon for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but which because of the crisis have led to an adjusted price offensive to be able to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, the entrepreneurs and associations of the sector interviewed agree.
To finish complicating the accounting, this year's calendar (when New Year's Eve fell on Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (16 and 17) and barely movement for the previous week.
As has been the case since 2008, when the weak cow stage began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners on a budgetary issue.
In order not to do without tradition, many workers keep it paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, both demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaiet-Fars.
The employer's representative, to this day, does not dare to predict what this month's celebrations will be like.
"People think about it a lot before they book."
"He wants to leave but he has the alerts on the issue of prices," he says.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at a good price and with good service," he adds, recalling that customers tend to go down one step with the crisis, so that the band around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
A poll in several central establishments shows the collapse of petitions for the night of the 17th.
In the group Soteras they indicate that there is a real boom in applications for that Friday, with the aim of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more advance booking, even since the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
In AN Grup, which flags El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 premises, they remain optimistic after detecting a turnover boom since the second semester and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group emphasize that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who pre-celebrate the parties.
To their six group menus they have added a Christmas one, with 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green sprouts in some companies that invite their employees again and feel that the volume of the groups is somewhat higher.
On the part of the employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Goma, hopes to start seeing the end of the tunnel and maintains that together the reserves are "encouraged," although the customers "negotiate to the maximum."
However, the illusion of the celebrations has not descended, pay whoever pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear program generates great concern in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country."
Wikileaks leaks confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused in Washington by the Pakistani nuclear program.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details they offer on the content of the talks and the thoughts of the accredited American diplomatic representatives in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, rather than increasing, "decreases," and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
The particularity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to make it difficult to destroy in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for unveiling in Washington.
This is what the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W, lists. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of then National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as a proliferating and reason for keeping their guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work on nuclear or missile programs," Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said in a meeting with their American counterparts.
The novel of the documentation leaked by Julian Assange's portal is the shrinking cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and Pakistan's high rate of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy office in May, which calls communication with Pakistan "frustrating," argues: "Transparency is often non-existent; offers of help go unanswered or discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, an official of National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit of the head of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the person responsible that "the Pakistan Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups."
On the hunt for the Wikileaks chief
Obama appoints top counterterrorism leader to avoid further leaks
Interpol issues a red alert in order to follow the movements and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be sure about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Besides, it's not new, but dates back to November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents but with the allegations of sexual abuse the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks creator Mark Stephens' lawyer says "police know where and how to contact Mr Assange."
It was on the 20th that the international police force based in Lyon, France, issued the order at Sweden's request, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have indications of identifying or locating Assange "with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as explained by the organization, do consider the so-called free-range network to make an arrest - which must be undertaken by the national police force - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The move has outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder has been willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities by videoconference.
They also recall that Assange applied and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor in her case, which they compare to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's head of security.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution," the letter denounces.
As the world seeks him - and from Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange remains unaccounted for, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave from an indeterminate location an interview with the editor of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy on the UN in violation of international treaties that the US has signed, he should resign," he said.
His opinion was despised yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior counterterrorism officer, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's attempt to downplay Assange's counterbalances with views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the lower house from January, has asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and pursue any contribution or help."
Further afield Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, has gone, who has had to retract after saying Assange should be "assassinated."
"Obama should make it a target and use a drone or something."
The unapologetic was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever in the government leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind," he said on Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with nods to those related to Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret ballot on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to overcome the umpteenth internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, not north by the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his love of resignation is insufficient for those close to former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his own mentor and that he can not cause him the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
For this reason, the leader of Esquerra will try to win over the new critics with winks that allow him to arm himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national councillors of ERC will be able to pronounce on their continuity in secret.
Through ballots, not by hand.
If the carodists want to vehicular a certain vote of punishment for the president, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of ranks wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he said that half more one of the votes would not be considered ratified, but added, without specifying percentages, that a result "to the Bulgarian" would not be good either.
Those close to Carod demand the president more than to make his position available to the militancy, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the highest body between congresses.
But without having enough majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap by May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will put to the vote of the national council on the 18th.
His intention is to endorse Puigcercós in exchange for him promising to advance the congress to autumn 2011, something that the dome already takes for granted.
The leader of ERC acknowledged that "polyphony" harms stability and that its objective is to make, once and for all, the organization able to wash the dirty rags of doors inside.
In this line, the article that the acting councillor Josep Huguet signed on his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the head of Innovació assumed that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives."
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first is to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, that is, to include new faces that come from the Carod-related sector.
The second may be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate assembly as a functioning mechanism at once.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows the congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive conclave of 2008 left the commission to the management to review the assembly at a specific congress of charter reform.
This meeting is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years discouraged the matter from dealing with.
Now, without sectors critical to stalking, it can be a good time to get it back and try to close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the MILENIO State of Mexico count, there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to the MILENIO State of Mexico.

The woman's skin detected tattoos of Holy Death, as well as necklaces with her image.
In the last part of the month, the body of a man in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group were found aboard a car.
Two days later, the bodies of a couple of men with their heads wrapped and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message allegedly signed by a criminal organisation that read: "This happens to those who do not align."

Next to him the agents found a cardboard with a message.
Keeps China targets for reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it supports its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emission by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by 2020, said Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei said his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to convert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community on this matter.
He said China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution-building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including the adoption last year of a new Energy Law, which sets out the targets set for reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in coordination with state and local authorities to achieve energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction targets.
In addition, it abounded, several multi-year plans, both financed by the Chinese government, and by governments of other countries, are underway or already completed.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which was implemented over the past five years and which received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for changing incandescent spotlights for savers and one more mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the country's climate change government, said China's efforts have been greater than is generally thought.
For example, he explained, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 per cent over the past five years and plans to do the same by 2020, he said.
Admitted to Espino's expulsion: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN detailed that the former Panista leader is entitled to go to the National Order Commission to demand what is in his right.
The PAN's national leader, César Nava Vázquez, said that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to the legality and that the former Panista leader is entitled to go to the National Order Commission to demand what is in his right.
In an interview prior to the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sound Order Commission."
"Mr Espino has his right to go, if necessary, through a complaint to the Order Commission of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken within the scope of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think in 2012 and that an alliance for the presidential candidacy was never at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that National Action will be strengthened from the internal election on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never at the negotiating table, at least not for now, was an approach to the local election that was successful and met the goal," he said.
The Panista leader said that the PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; the contender "we enjoy and strengthen us," he said.
He said the council will certainly be able to choose the best or best leader who requires National Action for the next three years, hence it will deliver the scam "to whomever the council determines."
"I have that absolute tranquillity and openness, either five would be proud to hand over the party president's office."
He predicted that the rebound in the party in the last elections of July 4 will be reflected in the next contests, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"For now it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, hence "many hopes, longings are put on them, and I am sure Gabino will live up to expectations."
When questioned about PRI criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech in the framework of the four years of his government, César Nava called on the PRI to reflect on the six-year periods of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the Zedillo and Salinas governments were better than Fox and Calderon's governments; that they start defending them; that they leave the closet," he said.
He felt that the head of the federal executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gag or much less censorship.
Promotes Obama on Twitter law in favor of undocumented students
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call on your senators and ties to pass this legislation," the U.S. president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter social network account.
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and introduce them to pass this legislation," Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps a cyber link open with a broader document that asks the public to communicate immediately with senators, as the bill's vote is imminent.
"With a vote expected to take place soon, now is the time to get your voice heard," he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation unless the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding is approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs hoped that once the fiscal issue is resolved, a timetable for the rest of the projects can be set.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax matter before the end of the year..."
"I think we can reach an agreement at some point in that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic majority leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would ask for a "debate shutdown vote" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, although more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or American Dream Act would legalize some 800 thousand young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have stayed in the country for the last five years and entered a higher education institution or the military.
But supporters need 60 votes to pass the initiative, which requires the contest of a handful of Republicans, at a time when pro-party organizations of the bill are lobbying to ensure the passage of the law.
Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
But at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against it, and only one Republican has expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That's why supporters of the Dream Act require adding to several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Maine senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Sen. George Lemieux of Florida, who completed Sen. Mel Martinez's tenure.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas but have said they will not endorse her on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported, John McCain, has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the sore
The second round of The Pleasures of the Language was a walk where the participants showed the narration
"Texual in the language I understand but... the finger on the sore? what is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The Pleasures of the Language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this time used the subtitle of her question (at another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the Language, she explained).
The finger on the sore... "puts us in trouble," the Argentine writer commented sweetly to the public, mostly of young people, who gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "llaga" is from doctor to doctor, of whom she does not get answers although she does clue in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist he comes out convinced: "Patience is not my forte, maybe it's my sore."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the aisle, but whoever clarifies that sore is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the sore is the real thing open, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "from the sore I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist," but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very hinted.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a delightful narrative that titled Praise of the Invention, where the finger on the sore is not named but at one point is discovered.
With brushstrokes of magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress, who also touched clouds, brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a maiden would have lost, a narrative that turned to speak later America, the great novel that his own chroniclers did not lack from the beginning to tell her and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of what the conqueror captains told.
"Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) made mockery of the feigned witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise the story of America with imagination that was lacking until modesty had never been told."
However, he stressed "it is the crazy and the deceivers who best imagine" and that is where reality and lie converge, where it is no longer known that it belongs to one side or another, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
He actually calls it the 'gavantine tradition'.
"By his inheritance we are what is told".
In her turn, writer Mayra Montero narrowed down and applauded the variety of interpretations that led to the invitation of the FIL with her round table The finger on the sore.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed hers towards the great wound of social violence that her country is going through - and shares Latin America - the product of the disputes of drug trafficking and sale.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditated," he said, citing that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the wound of the writer's committed writer."
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in the intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind every statement there is a small no and behind each denial there is a small yes."
"To own our thinking and own reality we have to nuance: and nuance means often putting your finger on the sore and annoying those people who are much more comfortable thinking of caricature, black and white, on established ideas and without nuance and also annoying the powers that prefer a black and white world," he said, inviting him to regain the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Ruben Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but has already managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other a contrast marked by the results.
Ruben Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already reached the decisive series three times, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up consoling himself with the runner-up's medal, has stayed a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he has played consecutive finals.
The sanctist strategist reached his first final as coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he was carrying the reins of Morelia with which he fell by global 4-2 to Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closing he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with overall of 3-1 and it was precisely before Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Devils, Rubén again suffered a setback, as his team ended up tied 2-2 against the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penaltis round he took advantage by 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three players of his failed from the 11 steps and suffered the 4-3 volvert.
Ruben has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore does not want to run the same luck, seeks to get rid of the curse and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he affirms that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to go out champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, because of a hobby that I owe myself to and as a result the title will come for me, but the above is the most important thing," said the helmsman when questioned about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very valid has the previous final, of which, he says, he has learned a lot, "the only teaching we can have is that until the referee whistle the end we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalties to throw we were ready to run out and I think that is a teaching, until the game is over we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal shots, something that does not bother him, because he trusts his players: "One never seeks to reach the batch of penalties, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and we have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately he made a bad play to fate, sometimes because of the nerves or the anxiety of having the title in our hands, but it left us, that left us something for this final that we hope we do not reach that instance."
Romano has in his hands to stop being a runner-up technician and try for the first time the glory given by the titles.
U.S. changes rules to get visa
Persons must go to the Visa Applicant Service Centres before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and the waiting time.
From January 10, 2011, the procedure of processing a visa will be changed at the U.S. Embassy and consulates.
Under the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to the Visa Applicant Service Centres (ASC) before their interview in the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to arrange the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for petitioned visa cases (including temporary worker visas) and $390 for merchant visas and investors.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be taken from the ASC, applicants requiring a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in the Consular Section less time than in the past.
Likewise, those applying for a visa in the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA will announce finding extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency summoned the press to present tomorrow a finding that will cause an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will release tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that there is an alien life.
The finding will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, science described as the one in charge of studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
In citing the press, NASA said it will present "a finding that will cause an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there are creatures on our side and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabitable, and put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Monkey Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way of survival and this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will release the true scope of the findings at the press conference tomorrow Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (Saturn's greatest moon), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Pattern 'block' opposition
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it leads to the arrival of 'bipartisanship', they denounce.
The 60th Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, headed by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanship' in the House.
Before starting the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'thundered' against the reform of the Organic Law, since he excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it begins the 'bipartisanship', because now it will be two people, of the same number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by the Panista Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo, detailed that these reforms institutionally constitute the political marginality on the part of the PRI and PAN.
He explained that in the coming days they will talk to the PAN and PRI representatives to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be overwhelmed again by both parties and this is the end of the opposition coalition.
"So far (the opposition coalition) arrived, it is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they do not even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patrón, there are coincidences and that is why they are forming a plural group.
Congress after being monopolistic cannot be allowed to now be "duoólico."
"It is not the spirit of law reform that there is an eternal bipatidism in Congress."
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking to other comrades to make them more, the convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that Congress currently became a 'booty' between two, in reference to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just a game, now they're handing it out between two."
Patron Montalvo, asked to respect the personality of the deputy, to be given his place at the negotiating tables.
"Let not by coupular agreements, 5 are left out that we are probably going to do 9 deputies, right now to the five who see us, separated in different factions, we have decided to unify ourselves to seek a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform that they made that they agreed, we are outside and we do not agree with that reform."
$200 thousand more come out for "the supplier"
Mazatlan City Council pays another check to the questioned owner of an electrical equipment company.
One more check for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company, amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last cheque number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts payable."
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had anticipated that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the Superior Audit of the State for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still owed to him and, therefore, how many more cheques are missing to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"You haven't bought anything, you're just getting paid what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the latter, on 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as set out in the Law when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer said they have not reused its services.
This, after July 25, Northwest published a review of the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos was paid by the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urge to attend tourist sites
They regret tourist entrepreneurs an accident of the foreign tourist due to poor conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination is taken care of and reversing the bad that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said the poor state of the streets and banquets has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the mess and take him around the nearby businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to close a company one day and have no idea what money is lost, or else they don't do the works in this way for so long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's fall exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it because giving preventive maintenance and not falling only into the corrective," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area maintenance must be given, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other places that also look careless and incomplete, he said, such as the Shield and the Mazatlan Venadito.
"Today, for the tourist to come, it does not depend solely on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions," he said.
"There has been no due attention and this kind of fact highlights something that is notorious for everyone, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent, as they are not used correctly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be put online in conjunction with the municipality and be a priority to keep the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put us online to make them attractive to add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination."
Requests IP results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, proposed that the deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A Legislature of decent work free of agreements between parties and the state executive claims the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th legislature, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI deputies, 13 from the PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one more of the PVEM, was installed, which adds a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to clean management and commitment to society and to the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism should not be repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly premiered 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that Members will really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is customary for them to make arrangements to ensure their own interests and become carnival comparsas of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
Hence he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that will bring the Governor forward in turn.
"We take care that they come to do a decent job and especially committed to society and to the sectors because it was the Sinaloans who gave them the vote of confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Hotels Tres Islas, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push economic growth, generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that will somehow encourage job creation."
Regarding tourism, he demanded that the new legislators give it the weight within the state budget to strengthen the Secretary of Tourism for the state.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is incongruous as important economic activity and generates foreign exchange and investment and that it directly competes with the agricultural industry."
In addition, it is necessary to label resources to detonating and that they help in giving security to the state and updating the Alcohol Act that they have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
A magician king is wanted
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the yearning of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For his parents, the next Day of Kings will be difficult to please his illusions, as his home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives a humble house in the Salvador Allende Colony and live up to date because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Sometimes we see it hard because my husband doesn't have chamba, but we sell mandarin and dad... already in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4, wants a doll or bike while her sister Elizabeth, three, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, José Alfredo, 10, has long aspired to have a 'monster' car and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests sizeable clothes for a year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I said 'let's see son', because he was very expensive," Cayetana recalled with sadness.
For older children, those in school, clothing and footwear would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11, is a size 12; Isaiah, 10, is a size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, wears size eight.
José Juan, 14, is short of tennis, so a couple of size five and a half or six would be of great help.
If you want to help realize the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the campaign Searching for a Wizard King, donating a toy or cash at the Northwest reception.
Fourteen alleged drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions took place as part of the dismantling of a Cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen people have been arrested who will face various charges.
The persecutions have taken place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the drug was produced.
"Around 750 plants in Cannabis, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment for production have been seized," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for Quebec Security.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear at Sherbrooke's courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of production from Cannabis, possession for the purpose of trafficking, plotting and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have been produced after a long investigation that has lasted about a year.
"It has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to make the arrests," Mr Ruel says.
About seventy officers from the Quebec Security Estrie investigation module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
Undercover free clandestine migration may be combated
The Conservatives' bill, which the government says should solve the problem of skirts loaded with clandestine migrants, will surely face strong opposition, as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I'm mainly based on the Charter."
"I am here with a party that has created the granite that you step on," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals argue that the bill, in its current form, would allow for the arrest of anyone from a ship identified as transporting illegal immigrants for up to a year, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Quebec Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe also said he could not support the bill because it points to the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government does," Mr Duceppe said.
The NPD's criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected at a stroke of criticism that her party is not firm enough with illegal immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree that action be taken against those in charge of the skirts and that is what we intend with another bill, the C-35," Ms. Chow says.
"We don't support the Conservatives' bill because it attacks refugees and jails children for a minimum of a year," Ms Chow explains.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the parties of the position of playing politicians and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as if it were a doormat."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to an election as a result of its rejection.
However, a Conservative has told QMI Agency that the Government would call for a vote for each MP to oppose it later to explain to their constituents.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption unit and collusion by Jean Charest, numerous observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
Public Security Minister Robert Dutil supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Investigation since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
As a result, Tuesday's announcement has caught more than one by surprise.
It should be said that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services held on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the Quebec party critic who deals with the issue of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to describe this announcement as "a rabbit pulled from the joke" and as "a last-minute sloppy solution."
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence over possible future unity.
"You'll see the results when we announce it," he says simply.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public poll.
"The more Mr Charest is stubborn in avoiding the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To break the deadlock, he suggests Quebec should give a special mandate to the general controller to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the general controller," he concludes.
It also believes that Quebec could give the controller the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing people to testify.
The creation of a permanent crew is not the only emerging project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also calls on Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, for his part, has confirmed that his counterpart for Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments on this issue.
During Operation Spring 2001 relating to biker groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Ottawa later pushed for the adoption of the gangster law.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several watercourses are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide took place at Shawinigan in Mauricie on Wednesday afternoon.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
In the evening, another landslide took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudiere.
A highway sank.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimetres is also expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
Sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimetres of rain.
As these rainfall adds to the melting of the snow that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that several rivers will break down.
On Wednesday night, Quebec's civilian security unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudire.
The northern rivers, in Saint-Jerome, in the Laurentides, and of the Chae, in Lotbiniere, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudire region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, 10 residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The civilian security unit remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, according to Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Quebec Growth Forecast Center, for its part, issued announcements on Wednesday reporting the strong floods of several rivers, including the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
They partially blame Dupont
Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain setback to the Canadian Council of Television Standards (CCNR) over controversial statements in relation to social assistance and Haitians, as well as their rude language on radio.
The CCNR believes Mr Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social care, unduly negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in broadcasts during the day."
The council also said the discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the name of two people who had committed suicide, did not breach the broadcasting codes.
CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made on broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint from the Common Front of People Receiving Social Assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters should communicate reliable data and not deceived data.
In relation to suicide, presenter Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be considered a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes called into question by "Dupont le midi" have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Therefore, any blame has been thrown away in this regard.
The latest litigation concerned the declarations made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At the time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had starred in a media standoff that had provoked numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter said he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure if those in need were actually going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issuance of rude language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio network has collaborated "even more than required."
The consequences will be minimal for the broadcaster, which will have to, inter alia, announce decisions once in the hours of the largest hearing within three days.
A kung-fu king in Montreal
The Argel origin mountaineés Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar tour.
The athlete, who stands out in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai box, climbs the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts such as kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," explained Zemmal, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
"In my case, I look for fights everywhere because, for those who don't enjoy the game on the ground that involves mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championships, held from 23-30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I've won in the categories of full contact kickboxing and thai box," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shou World Cup in China."
"They will invite athletes who have finished in the top four in the last world championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto".
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I ended up in eighth place".
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but reached third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is that I've been progressing in every competition."
"At this step, I'll be the first time or next year".
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline native to China in which it is allowed to hit with fists and feet, as well as throw opponents to the ground.
Clashes originally take place on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The most famous pugilist in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the martial arts world.
Although Nacer Zemmal should only maintain a competition in his career, he will no doubt go to the great tournament "King of Sanda," the Kung-fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China," explains the nice boy.
"It's like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It's been an amazing experience."
Zemmal has won his first match, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
"Whoever beat me is a real professional," he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals face each other in the final of their category."
"Then the champions of each category face each other to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded $450 million direct contracts to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the centre of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a previous tender the most important contract, the project management, for an amount of 295 million.
The consortium, called Energie Gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium of Energie rarance obtained the lucrative contract without a public tender being made in advance.
For the Quebec Party, the use of company consortia poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and lead to an increase in prices.
"This is a new method of collusion and eliminating competition."
"I mean, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly," Quebec Party MP Sylvain Simard said yesterday at a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he says, he does not understand how the public interest can be benefited in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau responded in the afternoon, firmly denying that there has been collusion with the contract.
"I started to get tired," he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted in a "dishonest" and "disrigorous manner."
He said it would "mindfully" the PQ would apologise.
The consortium formula is a common practice throughout the world.
Normally, it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to group their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In all cases, the contract has been granted without the competition coming into play; it has been a negotiation.
In addition, the consortia formula has ceased to be the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the consortia formula in the technical advisory sector is being investigated in the Government.
A quick look at Quebec's business record allows more than 200 consortia to be identified, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA, Generic, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, that is, Dessau.
With regard to the consortium "nergie geance," Minister Normandeau stressed that "James Bay territory responds to a particular dynamic of labour and Hydro-Québec has been responding specifically to it since the 1970s."
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been granted directly.
"If you respond to a tender and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the players in the sector and tell them: we're going to negotiate a satisfactory deal and at a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competence of people," Mr Laporte said.
The contract awarded to the consortium "nergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has won 22 contracts, Generic got 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, regardless of their participation in Energie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amounted to $49,783,344, including the contract for Energie gérance of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has suggested that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "good known from the Quebec Liberal Party."
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before specifying that it is more about their leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecologically, but deeply skeptical.
The Quebec consumer hardly trusts the actors of sustainable development, as well as fair trade brands or ecological certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Barometer of responsible consumption, the first results of which have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where messages are swarming that defend more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even slows its commitment.
Even if consumption of so-called "socially responsible" products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of the companies or environmental advertising of them, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of consumption responsible for the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of the official certificates carrying the so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of the products and brands bearing labels indicating that they are "responsible," says the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6 per cent of Quebecers take politicians' speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumer sector, currently supported by about one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, loopholes and the dubious nature of the information cause 46% of consumers to discard this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers also say they are wary of the alleged returns of the environmentally friendly products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
Sixty-one per cent have prioritized shopping in stores in their neighborhood and preferred to buy food products grown in their region, the Barometer says.
Greener and more responsible (the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 points above a maximum of one hundred this year), Quebec's Homo consumus loves to take the position of the king of recycling that tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, this social consciousness seems to be from doors (of their car) out: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or have shared a car to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which has just completed its first edition, support the use of bicycles and walking.
A loan for the state to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex posing the Société Angus and the Parallel, agrees to collaborate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallel, which were waiting for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard and return its true kinny vocation, have not obtained what they were asking for.
The Government has agreed to get involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan amount, which would in fact be less than initial expectations; it could be a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first plan of action and a request of $12.8 million last spring, but applications have since been revised downwards.
The President of the Société de développement des entres entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Francois Macerola, who leads the eXcentris file, sent a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He has sent him a final report a decade ago.
However, the SODEC received a cabinet counterproposal on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a State donation must be completely discarded.
Remember that the Association of Film Hall Owners and Film Complexes of Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, as it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, a number of representatives of the sector do claim considerable financial assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the same, has carried the burden of author cinema on its premises of the complex for ten years, after financing its own construction, which could justify a repeal by the Treasury Council.
The lack of separate cinemas is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to loyalize its clientele.
The company Angus and the Parallel, led by Christian Yaccarini, promote a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to make its way to the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallel, has been screening films on eXcentris.
The aim of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27, screening Xavier Beauvois' beautiful film "Des hommes et des dieux."
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals they have received.
The veil of complex Canada rises...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be the Canadians' compound with respect to Americans, but reflect the latter's feeling of superiority towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don't think about Canada-U.S. relations when they're going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the conservative government get its budget approved in 2009.
The four new communications between the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday offer rather juicy details that really substantial content.
A cable of 22 September 2008, i.e. during the middle of the federal election campaign, recounts the extent to which the United States does not enter the issues discussed by political leaders.
This caused a big surprise the U.S. ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of inferiority practically inherent in Canadians when dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign) ," he writes.
Therefore, he concludes, the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this choice: ubiquitous, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it."
The ambassador has even more problems understanding this "deensing silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, of a party and, even more, of the head of a party to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when it comes to voting."
This sentiment of importance can also be seen by the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Ottawa's business manager Terry Breese to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Their trip will help ensure the government's survival during the vote of confidence in early February over the federal budget, through which Canada will first run deficit in the last decade due to a $30,000 to $40 billion recovery plan," Mr Breese writes.
Nowhere is there any mention that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to prevent it from replacing the coalition or that opposition parties conditioned its survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington to the increasingly negative image transmitted by the dramatic series broadcast on the US CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the issuance of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which unsubtle references to Maher Arar, to the "No-Fly-List" or even kidnappings for the CIA to conduct vigorous interrogations.
Another cable says that, during her first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to take in some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner replied yes, but was "on each case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "he has delivered a document to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to review the file".
Finally, we can mention that the spirits have warmed up in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC radio that the person responsible for the mass leak should be "murdered."
In the United States they echo Mike Huckabee.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancun a plan for the renewal of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) by an amount that corresponds to almost one third of the additional decrease to be carried out to stabilize the world's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of major concrete projects that the UN expects to be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluocompact light bulbs or, even better, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), much of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet would be avoided to illuminate humans.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
That's the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the planetary car fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major issuing countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this amount should be reduced to stabilize, by 2020, the increase in temperatures by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from getting out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is still reduced twice as much.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those launched by the Philips manufacturer this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which allows us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in a hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with reatotes and emit very little heat.
Above, they contain no mercury.
Several specialists have expressed their reservations regarding fluocompact bulbs, as they contain mercury and should be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers place instructions.
However, the report indicates, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not fluocompact bulbs, but coal thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce electricity that is wasted on incandescent light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury a year.
The report details the benefits that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save $1 billion a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, i.e. the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost $2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast eagerly awaits announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Ivory Coast, as the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately," says a spokesman for the UN chief.
"Ask all parties in Ivory Coast and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has let Wednesday's deadline pass to midnight without the results being published, three days since Sunday's poll.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI had told television that the commission "continues to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara have multiplied worldwide.
However, Gbagbo's side has the annulment by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the new Forces (FN) since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the Ivory Coast president's campaign, said the voter intimidation maneuvers conducted by the FN in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepted the complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo's opponents consider the country &apos; s top court not to be neutral, since it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has judged the delay in the publication of the results "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have put the icing on the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the Ivory Coast's political class that they could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round on 31 October, with 38 per cent of the vote compared to 32 per cent for Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25 per cent in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), France's unemployment rate has remained stable at 9.3 per cent on the mainland (9.7 per cent taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected with the provisional seasonal variations (CVE) published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
Data for the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the working population on the mainland and 9.7% with DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has risen by 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but want to work, whether or not they are available in the two weeks to work and seek employment or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in mainland France (-0.9 points in three months, 0.5 points in one year), 25% including DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed within the ILO side.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, to 6.4% in mainland France (-0.2 points in both three months and one year), or 482,000 people over 50 years of age, which amounts to 6.6% with DOM.
There has been only a stability of unemployment among people aged 25 to 49 years of age, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, 0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhone, is under investigation and has been imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social property, embezzlement of funds and public property, cover-up, active corruption, influence trafficking and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all the questions the magistrate asks him, not ghosts."
"It is easy to chase him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before her client's appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the leader of the PS in the department, Jean-Noel Guérini, wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began investigating and jailed one of his close friends, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr Lucien Simon, the only thing his client has done has been to deal with the landfills he must manage.
As to the allocation of contracts or the destination of the funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to counsel Simon.
As part of this file, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, has also been investigated since Wednesday for embezzlement of funds and complicity, but he has been released on parole and is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts he has been reproached."
"The investigating magistrate has taken the explanations into account and released him," explained his lawyer, Mr Yann Arnoux.
On the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, four other people were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the Deputy Attorney General of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been charged with "traffic of influence and passive corruption."
Two officials of the Aubagne agglomeration, Michale Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for "subtraction and embezzlement of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and for "complicity in the embezzlement of public funds," respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for "covering up the abuse of social property."
Among those who have confronted Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently jailed in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts involving Corsica.
Researchers suspect their societies have served to launder the capital of great banditry.
The investigation is being carried out under a number of judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, particularly in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation points out that the investigations are especially concentrated in the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the waste of Aubagne, as well as other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elise has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage," has had the public in France in jeopardy, alerted diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elise has explained his strategy to Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own "hostages" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman did not take place in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian arrested in France and wanted by U.S. justice for trafficking in materials for Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the stark reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris, is titled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage-taking cases."
The advisor of the Eliseo for strategic matters, Francois Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do next to repatriate their own citizens forcibly held in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "continuously lets" the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release" in the media.
All to embarrass the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it even more often."
Because, once attempts to negotiate discreet channels have been exhausted, "silence will not solve anything," the Iranians are "experts in delaying maneuvers."
Mr Richier added that the detention of foreigners was "a common Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail."
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on August 16, the day he will take refuge in the French embassy) "will require the payment to Iranians of a large amount of money" (230,000 euros of reward).
In addition, he points out that the Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will increase."
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss leaves prison after twelve days, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by decision of a judge.
The US embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is close to Iranian clandestine networks of acquiring material for the nuclear program, Majid Khakavand's release is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Freeing the Iranian in exchange for the French woman?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, Francois Richier guarantees that it was not.
The Eliseo, he says, not only has he "bea tremendously surprised by the judge's decision," but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michale Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot annul the judicial decision," he says.
Mr Richier also wants to prove that Majid Kakavand remains under "close" surveillance of French intelligence services.
The Eliseo's advisor marks a telephone number, hangs up and then informs the US diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in buildings in Paris run by the Iranian embassy."
During Clotilde Reiss's arrest in Iran, the Elysée spares no effort, uses media reports and "flights" to make believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influence" role of "mediator."
The Americans observe this activity with some irony and verify that manipulation bears fruit, since several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials."
Why is it about such "gratitude" towards Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris wonders.
"Despite their praiseworthy statements, French officials acknowledge in private that they only have a vague idea of what Syrians have really done."
The document then addresses the reasons that have led the Elysée to give rise to this fiction.
The great communication effort "is intended to validate Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria," he says.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been branded premature and demeaned."
By "exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris tries to "show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to "sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran."
The U.S. embassy knows this as a good source.
On August 11, Francois Richier confies him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done something or not."
"But anyway, we've thanked him."
"At least this should cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in the Elise.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Sirius for having played an "active role in favor of the release of our compatriot."
From midnight, young Koreans can't play online
The South Korean government is to adopt a law called "Chemian" that will prevent teenagers from participating in online games after midnight blocking their access, government officials have said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gambling companies to block access to such games after midnight for young people under 16, according to representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"A lot of kids play all night and then find it hard to study at school and lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, ministerial head of the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6am.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he says.
The government also intends to ask companies to limit the daily access time to these games when the parents of young people so request, the person responsible added.
In addition, it will make available to anyone who requests free software that allows limiting the time of Internet connection.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly give news about various facts linked to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA designates organizing countries
Amid the storm caused by suspected corruption, FIFA's executive committee on Thursday appoints the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political choice where influence struggles and lobbying may come to a primary over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, a traditional bastion of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, given that the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), following a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue its implementation in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the heads of the Belgian and Dutch government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the economic and political interests at stake in a World Cup.
At theter-scenes transactions, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to FIFA's evaluation report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidates have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension of corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the opportunities of his country, the cradle of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood to the bush on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that has exposed three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to upset FIFA and embarrass England officials, who have launched into intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the helm.
The Head of Government hopes to reissue the successful blow by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had won the organization of the JJ.OO in 2005 for London. 2012.
This intense activity, will it be enough to regain England's brilliance before the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spanish-Portugal duo also has numerous strengths thanks to their stadiums, already ready, their experience (World of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the two countries' bleak economic and financial prospects could tear down their ambitions.
Possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they can achieve is to give points to Russia, turned into a weightless outsider despite the gaps in his candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in a direct allusion to the accusations of the English press against EC members.
"They're bringing out their dirty rags, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the 1994 experience, seems the most logical favorites.
The country's top economic power and home to FIFA's main sponsors, the country appears to have an advantage to Japan and South Korea, which have separately developed an excellent project.
However, these new nominations seem premature for two countries that have jointly organized the championship in 2002.
Another risk: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of chances by 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be harmed by the weakness of paid TV rights (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the test
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had implied that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less.
One mandate in the Elysée leads to another.
The current head of state will therefore again be a candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence of this does not combine well with the mystery that is often associated with the presidential role.
Therefore, it must always appear to be doubtful.
On one side and the other.
In 2006, even if they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that he did not rule out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "sometimes in autumn 2011."
Therefore, the fact that he deals with UMP Members on Tuesday night at the Elysée, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused some stir.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The president said only that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
Just conveying the facts, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has talked about the presidential elections, with a funny tone, in meetings of this kind.
"In the worst, or better case, you'll still spend seven and a half years with me," he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not wondering what's coming next."
His claims the day before yesterday do not bring him closer to the candidacy, nor does it any less.
They comment for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségoléne Royal has put to the fore what leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
On the contrary; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is what leads many people in the PS to demand that the battle be organized ahead of schedule.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer Francois Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46 per cent versus 44 per cent, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion on the issue at the UMP," the Prime Minister's environment reacted immediately and prudently.
"If you think you can lose, you won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win," says Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain its acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to specify the modalities of exit from the crisis or, at least, announce the interruption of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations which should be completed by the end of the year.
Because of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt issuing institute certainly cannot afford to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk aggravating a more than complicated situation today in European bond markets.
The political cost would be just as high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde supported the active role played by the ECB in favour of resolving the debt crisis of European states.
He did not want to say whether he believed the central bank should do more, increasing its state bond-buying program, for example.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans..."
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no more eloquent in terms of his intentions, indicating only that the programme of purchase of State Letters on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decided" during Thursday's meeting.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB's acquisition of Treasury bonds has doubled last week to about 1.35 billion euros.
In addition, according to the indiscreet market operators, yesterday he would have bought Irish and Portuguese securities again.
In total, the central banks of the eurosystem have acquired securities amounting to EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, it is not doubted that purchases will follow (see page 29).
Economists also do not foresee any significant changes in direction.
Although lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, it still makes unlimited liquidity allocations to beneficial and durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended today for a few months.
"I don't imagine you're going to significantly modify your show."
"If not, it would risk further tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that there will be a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011," anticipates Norbert Brems, economist in Salt.
Oppenheim.
With regard to interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of those bonds for the market to remain stable," adds Norbert Brsms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuance institute has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked increase in the returns paid by the most fragile states," said a major bond manager yesterday.
Because, if interest rates are put in the clouds, states will have even more trouble reducing their debt, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government caps the storm
After Italy began the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflux of 10-year bond rates.
A recovery from precarious calm.
Upon leaving a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said that they heard Giulio Tremonti call the situation "undecipherable" and that a "unforeseen" weekend was expected, statements later denied by the person concerned.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with German long-term rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy risk hedging contracts (CRQ) had skyrocketed to 263 points, causing a slight uproar in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, expressed "deeply concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the eurozone's third-largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnant income associated with it, which causes the State to be at risk of not being able to meet its funding needs.
Brussels' latest forecasts have meant a jar of cold water for the government.
Italian growth is estimated to reach 1.1 per cent in 2011 and 1.4 per cent in 2012, while the budget being considered in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the government deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% predicted by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary provisions can be implemented after the holidays, amounting to EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, further austerity measures should be taken," says Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy has the support of the international institutions.
"The foundations of its economy are in order and its accounts are in good shape, as we have been saying for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at Italy's International Monetary Fund at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either in the short or long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are lower than those required to other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
The problem of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which the elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, a period would be open unfavorable to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening mechanisms to combat the crisis
Christine Lagarde already repeated it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I believe that we have already demonstrated on Sunday, at night and day, that Europeans are clearly supportive, determined, committed to the defense of their currency and their monetary area."
Although relative, yesterday's relaxation in the rates of European States' obligations has boosted governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet talk about a principle of normalisation.
Rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most frequent target of speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems," says Exane BNP Paribas economists.
Especially because "the political pace is much slower than the pace of the markets."
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it hides, the European countries are intensifying the discussions to strengthen the mechanisms for the exit from the existing crisis.
Informal consultations between finance ministers who are most directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on track.
And this also taking into account the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings early next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the kind of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Singapore on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in the Far East about the developments in the crisis in Europe.
Although the aim of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first EFSF title issues are expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official representative told Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the countries on the front line, Portugal and Spain, they prepare to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms add to austerity measures with closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path than Greece and Ireland followed.
Both want to avoid at all costs applying for international aid before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms they consider essential to increase confidence in a lasting manner.
Finally, the capitalist partners of European funds are considering the options available to accelerate the process of normalisation of public bond markets.
By the way of Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the 750,000 million euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to re-exceed the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, believe an amount of around 100 billion euros in addition would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, currently endowed with EUR 60 billion.
A council that could certainly be examined in detail by European capitals.
Especially if market conditions get worse.
Snow and Ice: 24 apartments on orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and can affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sevres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen since Wednesday noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, the heavy snowfalls affect north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly on the Isle of France.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm are expected, punctually between 7 and 10 cm, in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The departments affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Cotes d'Armor, Finistare, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Isle of France and Lemosin.
The snowfalls are strong enough to cause circulation difficulties and affect some economic activities, alerts Météo France.
In the Cotes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads has been prohibited for heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
According to the gendarmes, traffic in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that it not be conducted except in case of need and the movement of certain TER vehicles during the day has been prohibited.
School transport in Picardy has been banned on Thursday.
No specific measures had been planned on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "urges all drivers to conduct with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines on Thursday to cancel 25 per cent of their flights at Paris's Roissy airport and 10 per cent in Orly because of the planned snowfall.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south London, and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport on the Isle of France has reached its peak, billions have rained.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro to be built by Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the State has announced a funding allocation of 4 billion euros.
On the theoretical level, this sum will then allow the GSP to obtain loans on the markets to finance part of its double loop.
Today, finally, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 amending finance law, discussed in the National Assembly's finance committee this morning, contains the devices planned to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in the office tax on the Isle of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is "for the benefit of the Société du Grand Paris public institution."
In addition, it is set in numbers: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year."
The second is an amendment to an office tax that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and allocate this increase to Société du Grand Paris."
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
No figures are given in the text.
But it's far from $4 billion.
"It is specified that the tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the allocation of funds that the State will mobilize and that they will be granted to Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," we can read in the explanatory statement.
The GSP is not surprised by this system.
"From the moment income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4 billion later, we explain."
"It shall be recorded in the budget and used on the basis of the needs."
The GSP estimates that it will begin to receive 4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the promised 4 billion are not included in the credit, can provoke a slightly lit parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on 7 December.
Avenging hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems to be scandal in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation of the fact that each file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) is made up exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual customs only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi's sinisterly ridiculing profile has long given ideas to cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The rule that secret files should only be made up of news of public knowledge is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chéteau, the Templars or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unprecedented research (or do not know where to seek novelties about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism not only trust what they already know, which reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as the head of the secret services (if he could not be, I know, editor of the Libération), is lazy (or he is lazy (or he is sure what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sent by the U.S. embassy in Rome to the State Department was the same as published by Newsweek the week before.
So why have the revelations of these files caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, that is, that embassies, at least since World War II and since heads of states can be called on the phone or catching the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited representation exercises, have been transformed into espionage centers.
Any viewer who watches research films knows perfectly well, we just pretend we don't know because of hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world significantly affects the prestige of the State Department.
The scandal therefore affects both victims and "executors."
But let's get into the true nature of what's happened.
In the past, in the Orwell era, all power could be conceived as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true since, being able to control every move thanks to the phone, every transaction made, hotel visited, motorway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as is now the case, that not even the crypts of the secrets of power can't escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship is no longer one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of the citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that can no longer be endured or keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel has already said, that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be unveiled); it is also true that all knowledge about Berlusconi's or Merkel's character is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public sphere; but revealing, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means taking away all power.
WikiLeaks hasn't hurt Sarkozy or Merkel, but, and much, Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any reserved information on the network, since it would be like posting it on a poster in the middle of the street.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, you cannot expect to have confidential conversations on the phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state has travelled by plane and contacted one of the counterparts.
How can they maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the time being, my foresight is a matter of science fiction and, therefore, novel, but I imagine government agents who discreetly move in proceedings with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned by heart or, at most, hiding some data written on the helels of their shoes.
That information is then preserved, in a single copy, in locked drawers: after all, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is currently advancing as a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless Telegraph revolutionized communications, the internet has re-created a telegraph with cables (telephonic).
Video tapes (analogs) had allowed film researchers to study a step-by-step film, advancing and retreating, discovering all the secrets of the montage, while now the CDs (digitals) only allow to advance or back from chapter in chapter, that is, to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the travels involved, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary that politics and communication techniques take us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was being secretly plotted in embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that ask the press for confidential information.
Climate: France's sloppiness on its funding pledges
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the rapidly unblocked funding pledges (called fast starts or early) by developed countries have been respected.
And the French saucepans have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed themselves to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed itself to EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.260 million (i.e. 420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to fast-thart funding is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation was appreciable and appreciated for what was really worth it: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2.2 billion euros, which puts it on track to meet its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
Under the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without harming official development assistance.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission has taken as its reference in 2009: international funding is maintained and 150 million in three years in fast-start financing is added.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 is "new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of aid from France to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), while it seeks to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds..."
Another crucial element, the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no standard and each one chooses the calculation method.
Some, like France, consider that each euro borrowed is equivalent to a euro donated.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often, projects related to emission reduction that are based on more effective technologies), it is impossible to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated... At most, only the cost of the loan for the loan for the country granting the loan (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be computed for your commitments.
But France does not find such reasoning useful: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros); consult the EU document to see it by your own eyes.
This is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it by 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect its commitments to 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes a euro to fulfil its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
A good trick.
In short, in its fast-start funding, France carries out a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to actions over time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending only 36.1 million euros, he manages to give the impression that he spends 420 million "new and additional," as promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States go to continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in the negotiations, since developing countries are not fools...
The chapter on early funding is a relatively short-term minutiae in relation to the whole climate negotiations.
But it could be a grain of extra sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it doesn't.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, in particular, France could advance the discussions on betting on long-term funding (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not get rid of the question of the "additional character" or the method of computing loans.
France could change its stance to become as progressive on this issue as it is with others.
We therefore hope for the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast starts and its vision of the "additional nature" and the use of loans would help improve the level of international confidence needed to move forward with negotiations.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old boy ingests 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the old movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated," acquired in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September the foods usually consumed by a child of about ten years old in four meals and a snack a day.
These meals taken as a model, which comply with official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 litres of water a day), as well as treats, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 classified as possible or probable carcinogenic and five substances classified as safe carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disrupters (PE), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although, in virtually all cases, the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that the exposure of consumers to potentially carcinogenic pollutants and/or PE is worrying," says the association.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered to be safe carcinogenic, as well as about twenty waste that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack for the school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green beans, included in food, where the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian steak, canned tuna and even the bread bar or gum were dressed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, the analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most "nutritive" with 34 chemical waste detected and even analysis of the plastic dish used to heat food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk these "pollutant cocktails" generate for the consumer "is probably underestimated," the study says.
The Europe Ecology-Les Verts Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the face of the gravity of the situation" to implement a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop "the increase in diseases associated with civilization."
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EASA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of which were in cereals.
