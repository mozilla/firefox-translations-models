Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament has today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment of the section of the Criminal Code in which the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko is sentenced.
The modification would open the doors to the release of the former prime minister, but the parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the sentences for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly signing an agreement with Russia that was disadvantageous for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The sentence is not yet final, the appeal court has the obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West doubts have arisen about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code with which the former prime minister was sentenced was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
For its approval, 226 votes were required.
Libya&#39;s victory
The history of Libyan liberation, or of the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war anymore.
It remains to define who is the winner
As is customary in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it is a matter of determining whether they are moderates or radicals
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, the sharia, which we already know to a certain extent.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will have their hands cut off.
Women can already forget to emancipate themselves and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, the society, made up of warring tribes, will be united by the Koran.
An order will be established in Libya that we cannot even imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and, probably, it did not suit the already mentioned Libyans.
The truth is that it is not surprising that the Islamic fighters gratefully accepted the help of the infidel dogs.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, the NATO attacks were not led by an American general, but great be Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When looking for victors in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a gunfight used by Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally with no guarantee of profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not occupying Libya militarily.
In this case, it is not a problem for the locals to expel the &quot;crusaders&quot;
But, without occupation, will the oil companies manage to get hold of the Libyan black gold with only good words?
Quite possibly not, but it may be that the West can finally boast of protecting human rights.
As long as the sharia followers don&#39;t come across us.
A new era of crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe are on the lookout for investors
A statistical whirlwind has swept across Europe
Individual States have released their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the four-month period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors no longer look only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates for economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany&#39;s GDP grew by 0.5% forecast, France&#39;s by 0.4%
Both countries have published the data for the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the expected 0.1%), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1% ( the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the four-month period, the gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and, according to the ČSÚ, the trend towards a gradual deceleration in the growth of economic development is confirmed.
The results are even worse than analyst forecasts.
Main events:
On a year-on-year basis, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but on a four-month basis it has stagnated.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with analysts&#39; expectations.
The Greek economy has fallen 5.2% year-on-year.
The interest on its ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
The interest on Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problematic situation is also beginning to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
Interest on ten-year Czech bonds remains at 4%, although the situation in the area is getting worse.
Voices are being raised in Germany that the ECB should lend as a last resort.
The Czechs qualify for the Eurocup.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the qualification with a bonus of 200 million.
The soccer team meets the most difficult assignment of the entire season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and the brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jiráček, they won 1:0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended fantastically against the home team&#39;s attacks, so they will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz closely followed the development of the match in a detailed report.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the home team towards the end, and also to the excellent play of Čech and the heroic Jiráček, won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates their passage to the European Championship.
Due to the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two losers of the match were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who missed two great chances.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech eleven will not miss the European Cup event, for which the national football coffers will receive an approximate bonus of 200 million crowns.
From the first minutes there was a good offensive game.
Both teams were determined only to maintain the lines and played nothing more around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from the local players in the first half, kicks to the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense knew how to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country&#39;s nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they want to express their support for their country&#39;s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed Tuesday at noon in front of the facility and afterwards chanted slogans of death to the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students in the Iranian city of Isfahan formed human shields around the nuclear technology center where uranium is being worked on Tuesday.
They want to show that they are willing to defend their country&#39;s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, according to all indications, is striving to obtain nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students prayed at noon in front of the Isfahan nuclear facilities and then hurled death slogans against the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the objective of which would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear program, it would hit, according to Israeli sources, not only the Isfahan plant, but also the Natanz facilities, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner sausages
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9% of the school population and obesity 5%.
Obese children mostly come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, according to current research.
It once again demonstrates the importance of the environment where one grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obese children eat, for example, sausages at least twice as often as children from families with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had French fries for dinner the day before the analysis, which is linked to the &quot;Obesity is not a coincidence&quot; prevention program.
In the families of overweight children there is no habit of practicing sports, which is applicable to the majority of current families, where only 15% of the children responded that their parents find time for exercise at least once a week. physical exercise.
Survey carried out on 900 children
The survey was carried out at the end of last school year and almost 900 children in Basic Education from all over the Czech Republic participated in it.
It was already the second edition of the &quot;Obesity is not a coincidence&quot; program, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand children from the 4th to the 8th grade have participated in the project.
An adequate diet and plenty of exercise as a family are determining factors, which significantly reduce the number of overweight and even obese children.
&quot;Only half of the children surveyed have answered that they have five meals a day according to the regime: breakfast, lunch, lunch, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet,&quot; says one of the results of the survey. .
Without breakfast but with sausage for dinner
Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, details are also important, which also count, such as having a fixed time for breakfast as a family.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of school families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each one eats breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was discovering that 10% of homes do not have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that in families with obese children, unhealthy French fries are consumed much more frequently.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink sweet soft drinks daily (70%).
As a general rule, more than 40% of the children surveyed do sports, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
make your diet
The next phase of the study made it possible for the chosen kids (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all the possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
&quot;The food preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15, from the point of view of healthy eating, are far from ideal.&quot;
Among his favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
&quot;The popularity of sweet soft drinks is especially alarming,&quot; the final report of the study warns.
As a main meal, pasta takes the cake, followed closely by poultry.
Children practically always reject legumes and their taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Change to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
&quot;In the control group of study participants, who filled out the questionnaire after finishing the prevention program &quot;Obesity is not a coincidence&quot;, there was in many cases a significant change in favor of the principles of healthy eating &quot;, it is pointed out in the results of the study.
It is striking, for example, what is related to sweet soft drinks, where many children would begin to prefer normal, ordinary water.
The children would also choose poultry and fish for the main meal more frequently in the questionnaire and would restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In the introductory article, How Stylists Learn, I already complained a bit that the initial lessons were already pretty loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Lectures by three industry professionals, how to dress problematic characters, and also a seminar on how it works in show business.
And it will be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no room for a pin.
We are once we have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) on how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the vast majority.
Someone is short-necked, someone has a slim figure without proper curves, and someone is overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften broad shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We&#39;ve been given some tricks on how to make the body of women like Jennifer Lopez stand out, with huge breasts and hips but a narrow waist, and at the same time not dress too defiantly.
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so much that the skirt or pants do not fit, it is worth having at least one extra piece of fabric sewn to size.
You certainly won&#39;t regret it, because clothes that fit perfectly are priceless.
With a tailored skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing at the waist, etc.
The stylized body can afford to wear clothes with pleats, ornaments, embroidery or draping.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I am glad that I have the whole week to put all this information in order in my head.
And even so, I&#39;m afraid that with the assigned task, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, who must design two costumes: one for the day and one for the night.
You have to take into account the current appearance, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
I have had to &quot;dress&quot; Miranda Kerr, perhaps you know her from the Victoria&#39;s Secret campaign.
I scream inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who will have put on about a hundred kilos lately (please, take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut out the dresses from magazines or find them on the internet and print them, to later elaborate them graphically.
The moodboard, which is what the complete result is called, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of the styling.
The stylist, therefore, not only dresses physically, but also deals with, for example, the product pages in magazines (on specific topics, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about all this.
But all this is left for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three specialist guests enlivened Saturday&#39;s conference with information on all kinds of bodies.
The stylist Honza Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same item of clothing in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, essential.
Thus, such a trench coat (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed in the classic style with jeans and a T-shirt, but it can also be used to dress the naked body with high-heeled shoes and photograph it as if it were really a dress.
Or just roll up the sleeves and turn up the collar to get a totally different image.
&quot;Play with it,&quot; he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: &quot;To start working, you first need to know all the rules.&quot;
&quot;Then you can break them,&quot; Jakub said.
It is finally clear to me why we memorize all those formulas, what is combined with what, why, if it later turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes in stock than they intend to shoot.
Thus, for a fashion story that has ten pages (therefore, ten outfits), you must have at least fifteen prepared, ready to wear.
And besides that the photos, the clothes work in combination with other clothes, all of them different from those used in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that image and style alone are, in many cases, half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, at the moment, there is not yet a clear tendency to use the services of stylists.
Even famous people also find it useless (my skills are enough for me, my physical appearance is not that important).
And when someone asks us for our services, we must take into account that it is very likely that they will indicate a size that is very different from their real one (smaller).
Then all you have to do is googling and find out if gossip magazines have already written about it, if a certain celebrity has gotten fat/lost, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that it is not enough for a stylist to focus on fashion, but rather that they have to understand outfits.
During your work, above all you must communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he does not neglect himself, he defends his opinions.
&quot;When a director hires you to classify her wardrobe and complete it with beautiful clothes, you can&#39;t take and throw away everything that was there and say: &quot;oh, what a horror&quot;&quot;.
&quot;Find at least a couple of things that you can ponder and recommend for someone to wear,&quot; says Mario.
He himself also showed us that everything must fit into the so-called &quot;placovka&quot;, that is, the labor exchange.
This is fixed around the waist and all the necessary tools are kept there.
They are scissors-like objects, such as scissors, lint removers, or safety pins. There is also nylon thread (which is useful to the stylist during the photo session of products such as bags or hats), special clips for attaching garments in front, if this is larger (pins and other types of attachments are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a sewing kit.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to cover the sole of our shoes.
Even during photo sessions in the studio, on a flat surface, the sole could be damaged and even more so the exterior.
And we did nothing more than cover and cover.
We couldn&#39;t touch the shoes with the scissors so as not to accidentally damage them.
So you had to be very clever.
Mario has given me joy by praising my work without reservation.
The truth is that I am not very good at those skills.
This is only a small part of everything we have heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I have already realized that dedicating myself to styling at a professional level is not a bed of roses, but I don&#39;t care exactly what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run you compete across America.
Review
A trip, initially carefree, is complicated by a series of oversights inappropriate for a routine trip during the morning shift.
To a certain extent, expectations were met, but this is of no use if, in reality, nothing extraordinary was intended.
The new installment, to which The Run is added to the title, aroused great expectations even before its premiere.
It promised that it would give new air to the old Need for Speed racing saga and, as a result of what has been shown, it appears as a game that should not end up being just another action genre again.
We are also curious as to how the inserted scenes would look, where the main character gets out of the car and walks on his own feet.
As often happens in NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be considered acceptable, but in the total calculation points are lost due to absurd failures, which have been appearing in the series for years.
In reality, they cannot even be called errors, but rather the incomprehensible reluctance of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced to a story, whose main character, Jack, has some personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to take part in an illegal race across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the West Coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
From this it follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
In this way, one does not even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same thing.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the graphics is equivalent to that of previous installments in the series.
Therefore, it is nothing special.
But the walk through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high mountains covered with snow produce a very pleasant visual effect.
Also, careers branch out from time to time for an outlier element.
So, for example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you have to be careful so that an avalanche does not bury you.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that&#39;s enough.
For a moment, you try to overtake a required number of rivals (normal in a classic race), then you try to gain time (timed classic duel) and then a duel against a single opponent awaits you.
In the midst of all this the police sometimes show up, which only makes things even more difficult.
The novelty are the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game than you might expect (specifically, there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element is not annoying and, in the already mentioned context, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous episodes.
That means that today it is no longer a big deal, but it cannot be said that it is bad.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you can already look elsewhere.
But for a race conceived with a lot of action, this style of driving is quite convenient, although we can find something better among the competing games.
So far, everything in order.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correctness of driving models, the same is no longer true of collisions.
Games of this type cannot be expected to recreate complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before hitting any object, you cannot predict how your car will react, so not everything is in order.
It is typical that, when overtaking very closely or driving the car in normal traffic, there are only slight scratches, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up doing uncontrolled pirouettes.
Or even just completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, there are no big problems, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are programmed in such a way that when you have an accident or go off the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each race there are only five available resets.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it is only a help in case something goes wrong, but it is not very reliable.
Sometimes, not even resetting helps, it only helps to learn the given stage by heart.
A great disadvantage of the game is that the same events are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise they are impossible to take.
Other times you find &quot;civilian&quot; vehicles somewhere always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or arrive five minutes before or after.
This is especially infuriating in situations when you see that two cars that are going to meet in opposite directions, your opponent overtakes without problems, but when you arrive, you must turn or brake.
It doesn&#39;t matter when you arrive, because it&#39;s programmed because the &quot;surprise&quot; will always happen right under your nose.
Opponents also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will arrive at places where, regardless of the moment, the same adversary will always overtake you in the same place.
Also this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any cost.
When it&#39;s in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming in front of you, so at first you can smash the car to mush.
The idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline can be understood, but the execution is so apparent that you will surely be disappointed right away.
And it&#39;s a shame, because even if the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and action-packed, so that it is often not possible to follow exactly what is happening and where.
And it really doesn&#39;t matter, if the credit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the classification in the race so that there is no room for boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during the races.
You have to be attentive to the gasoline pumps on the side of the road, because right there you have to change your car, although in the vast majority of cases what you have will suffice.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, American muscle cars for straight highways and exotic supercars for technical driving, for example on curvy mountain roads.
In addition to the main narrative thread, a parallel challenge thread also appears, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know from the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which is used for both challenges and stories.
Upon reaching the top level, the driver is presented with various possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog function is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and makes other community functions available.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in the story is made.
With the car you get to the subway tunnel (pass), where you start running in the dark along the tracks (pass).
The speedometer shows you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, the metro convoy arrives from behind and takes you ahead without further ado.
In the newsroom we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one thought even a little or if the authors really take us for a bunch of idiots.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects are in most cases pleasant, sometimes even superb.
Well, what a pity that, in the most tense moments, the image quality is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This affects above all accidents involving many participants, when the continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to be liked by most of the youth group, the soundtrack falls into the &quot;everyone from their father and mother&quot; category, but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for its music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely silly bugs, we&#39;d have a hard time calling The Run the best NFS game of recent years.
It feels like the game isn&#39;t over.
Fun is guaranteed, but be prepared because the bugs will hit you in the eyes with the force of airport reflectors.

The ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation for naysayers and Eurosceptics.
&quot;The Lisbon treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions&quot;
&quot;I didn&#39;t expect an all-out war to break out.&quot;
&quot;It will last five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a bit, calms down and the new players get used to their new roles,&quot; was how the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law with conviction. Vicenova.
How can one not take his motto &quot;clearly and openly about Europe&quot; seriously, which he said already in the first part of his lecture, when he managed to describe each EU body and their relations with such precision and clarity, that it would be the envy of many lecturers from the U. Carolina School of Law.
Vicenova also praised the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
&quot;The first thing comes the criticism, that if he is insipid, a gray official, capable of assuming any role, but I have to say that he left everyone baffled, because he assumes his roles perfectly.&quot;
&quot;He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 states, how to communicate with them and who has a very clear vision of where the EU should go.&quot;
The new position of representative of the Foreign Policy and Security is explained from the question: &quot;Who is this EU? What number can I call it?&quot;. It is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of the political union in the face of States such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban us from Olomouc cheese
Vicenova has also dealt with the agenda that the European Council followed, continues and will follow in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis, and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has many commitments at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador: &quot;a good fuss&quot;, not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, the seven-year budget of the EU must be approved, caused by the current economic situation, which is much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive more support and which less? That is something that will be on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: &quot;About Europe clearly.&quot;
&quot;The truth is that I don&#39;t like ugly abbreviations, foreign words or jargon that people don&#39;t understand.&quot;
&quot;How can a citizen understand that cucumbers are not really invented in Brussels, curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to ban Olomouc cheese from us?&quot;
It also aims to get more out of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of speeds awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people perceive the negative aspects more than the positive ones.
In addition, he regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
Many factors are to blame, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the lack of support from the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
&quot;Believe me that when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches me, a Frenchman next to me says: &quot;What, have you already met, those of the Visegrad Group?&quot;, and it is seen that he does not care. no grace&quot;.
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, awaits new very harsh budgetary policy regulations for the Member States.
The concept of two-speed is perceived as something very real, if not more, then in Europe, more than the new &quot;European Federation&quot;.
&quot;We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone.&quot;
&quot;We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure.&quot;
&quot;It was said for the first time that only the countries that want to cooperate and those that don&#39;t, that they stay out.&quot;
&quot;These procedures will be more and more and will reinforce the Europe of two speeds&quot;, Vicenová hopes.
In this sense, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in applying the principle, according to which all issues that affect the whole of the EU must be discussed among the member states, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
Innovative IBM enters its second century of existence
If someone were looking for a term that defined IBM&#39;s strategy with great precision, the closest would be &quot;long term.&quot;
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet a hundred years have passed since its founding.
The basis of this long-term character was laid by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the motto that many of the world&#39;s problems can be solved if people are willing to think.
His motto &quot;Think!&quot; it became his seal, around which the life of the future giant will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
Watson was also the foundation of a carefully crafted company culture.
&quot;For us, IBM means long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it stayed true to its core principles, but was unafraid of the changes around it.
That has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to prosper even more in our second century,&quot; said the current director of the company, Samuel J. Palmisano, during its anniversary.
A sophisticated system
Watson, as early as the 1930s, cared about the care of his employees as the businessman from Baťa in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first American workers to enjoy paid vacations, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system that rewarded the best inventors and salesmen.
The same long-term sophistication is maintained by IBM in the relationship with the client.
From the beginning the company knew how to discover talents (being one of the first companies in the world to put an end to any type of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
IBM&#39;s current plan is in line with the anti-discrimination strategy, whereby Palmisano will be replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has now worked for thirty years at IBM, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategy.
During the last few years, IBM has participated in the so-called virtual meetings, online brainstorming, from which an infinite number of future strategies and innovations emerge.
It is not surprising that there are plenty of ideas, since almost half a million people work in the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
&quot;From the beginning, IBM was more of an institution than a technology company,&quot; says Harvard Business School economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
&quot;IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users,&quot; says George Colony of Forrester Research consultancy.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the business and directly creating a business.
IBM - or &quot;Big Green&quot; - as it is familiarly known in the US because of its logo, has become one of the world&#39;s largest companies in the last hundred years.
It is possibly the most versatile technological company (it develops both equipment and programs, infrastructures and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the largest number of patents of any North American technology company and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among his inventions are the ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, barcodes, and floppy disks.
IBM will bill this year 220 billion dollars. This year it has become the second technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it surpassed Microsoft for the first time in 1996.
Looking at the future
Not all products and innovations just satisfy the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
&quot;If your business is based on moving forward, you can&#39;t be emotionally anchored in the past,&quot; recognized Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this reason, IBM has no problem building its foundations on other platforms (and equally, if they don&#39;t work, it abandons them).
And this sets it apart from the competition, Microsoft, which basically stands and falls always exclusively with Windows.
future technology
In terms of sales, IBM is primarily engaged in services, of which about one-fifth are software and another fifth are hardware.
Yet even in 1990 equipment represented more than half of the supplier&#39;s share.
Starting in the year 2000, IBM has sold underperforming assets worth a total of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first manifested itself.
IBM acts according to the premises of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 1929 increased investments.
It seems that until now the IBM company has managed to weather the crisis.
The value of IBM shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospherically up to 120%, the net profit of the company has not stopped increasing.
IBM&#39;s motto is to change everything except its value.
It can therefore be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will hold on.
IBM history: from the cheese slicer to spaceflight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York one hundred years ago, its original name being Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM is adopted as early as 1924 - originally it was a brand name used in branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation that gave rise to the birth of IBM arises from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He had inventions such as the famous &quot;clock clock&quot;, which allows controlling the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its supervisory board.
Flint recruited the head of a competing company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (Watson&#39;s ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business gadgets, from meat and cheese slicers to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson led the company, revenues doubled to $9 million and the company&#39;s great expansion across continents began.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, after almost forty years in the chief&#39;s chair, he was succeeded by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights into space (to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic &quot;fish&quot;, which set the standard for computers at the time, hit the market under the name of the IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of the Pricewaterhouse Coopers company and began to offer comprehensive advice and high value-added services.
The strategy that IBM has paid for in the last three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, &quot;a smarter planet.&quot;
Its aim is to make a more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned and circumstances have not been improved, for example, with regard to transport and city administration.
For the commerce sector, IBM recently introduced the &quot;Smart Commerce&quot; platform that enables retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 it opened a branch in the then Czechoslovakia, the first country to have one in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing center in Brno here.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Also here is a world famous research team working with speech recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep that donkey, I don&#39;t want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it&#39;s over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become Iveta Bartošová&#39;s (45) only protector, but also her lover, Darina kept hoping that Josef would wake up from his rosy dream and come home.
However, he is no longer going to wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
&quot;Pepe can come home, but not as my partner anymore,&quot; Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová welcomed Bartošové into her home for the summer, she could not imagine how their marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after Říčany and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even declared publicly that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned herself, apparently accepting her husband&#39;s relationship and even saying goodbye to him forever.
Rychytář doesn&#39;t care who his wife sleeps with.
If one day Rychtář broke up with Bartošová, his wife would not wait for him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will kick him out.&quot;
&quot;But here I would live no longer as my dear old donkey who made a mistake, but as a man to whom I have certain ties,&quot; Rychtářová said, adding that she had already disengaged from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Up to now, Josef doesn&#39;t care that his wife has closed the back door on him.
&quot;I accept my wife&#39;s decision.&quot;
&quot;I will be with Iveta and there is no change possible.&quot;
&quot;My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect that.&quot;
&quot;The company is still in force, I do the housework, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping.&quot;
&quot;Darina and I talk to each other normally, the only thing is that we don&#39;t share a bed,&quot; Rychtář said.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he would not object.
&quot;We don&#39;t sleep together and she doesn&#39;t interest me, or where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it&#39;s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility&quot;, concludes Josef.
The worst vices of women: Do they also apply to you?
If you ask men to be able to cite some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where certain feminine vices are cited that make men&#39;s blood boil?
Go shopping
Do you reproach your better half for being dependent on shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one rag a week?
Do you like to shop often on sales?
So in her case it can be said that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should ease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But hey, what woman could resist the urge to just wander through the clothing stores, look for well-fitting clothes, and then try them all on in the changing room (ideally in all different colors)?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it can be practically hell.
Just remember how many times you&#39;ve already told your partner to wait for you outside the door.
The constant dissatisfaction
&quot;Am I not too fat?&quot;
&quot;I would need to lose at least ten pounds - should I start exercising?&quot;
&quot;Did you really like it?&quot;
Do these phrases ring a bell?
what yes?
So she&#39;s one of those women obsessed with her appearance.
It&#39;s not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing their partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It&#39;s like an infinite merry-go-round.
Cleaning the windows, vacuuming, mopping the floor, dusting, scrubbing the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on your clean floor with a dirty foot, or your children for dirtying a freshly cleaned sink and a glass-fronted bookcase that you worked so hard to clean?
In case you suffer from this &quot;deviation&quot;, try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness surely should not be paramount in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
make nasty comments
&quot;Used underpants are left with dirty clothes.&quot;
&quot;Do you want to wear those used socks tomorrow too&quot;
&quot;The wet rag is not left on the floor!&quot;
If you make these comments to your partner more times a day, know that this will get him out of his mind.
Naturally. You don&#39;t want to say anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
slander and gossip
Some women are also into slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracies against someone.
Women are relationship focused, so they like to talk together about who, where, with whom, how, and why.
Maybe each of us sometimes slips a small and harmless gossip.
With the hand on the heart, this is characteristic of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossipy women who do not control themselves, who love to gossip and do it often, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female work team.
Jágr and Voráček helped beat Philadelphia with their assists
Hockey forward Jaromír Jágr participated in the NHL game on Monday with two assists that brought the victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina field and put the Czech players back in the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star&#39;s play, and went one step further and was declared man of the match.
He claimed two assists in the match and so did Jágr&#39;s teammate Jakub Voráček.
After the match, Jágr told overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a big night.
&quot;I had already told him before the game that he would do a hat-trick.&quot;
&quot;L knew&quot;.
&quot;Sometimes they look like ambushes,&quot; explained Jágr, after his performance had given Giroux a goal, following Flyers&#39; first whiplash.
A while later also the second intervention of the team had a Czech trace.
Voráček grabbed the puck behind the Hurricanes goal and moved it around the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was sent off, but from the beginning of the second half the Flyers already dominated.
Specifically by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr, he scored the third goal, after his shot slipped through Wayne Simmonds&#39; fourth goal.
&quot;I love playing with him.&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t want to say that he is the best player on the field, but he is certainly among the top three,&quot; Jágr pondered his center back.
&quot;It never would have occurred to me that at the end of my career I would be playing with an athlete like him.&quot;
&quot;I am very pleased with it.&quot;
&quot;I want to play for him.&quot;
All these years in the NHL, my teammates played for me, and that now produces results,&quot; adds Jágr.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with the goal by Tuom Ruutu and then again by Dwyer, from a penalty, until they were one goal away.
Matt Read allowed no further complications, though they ended up outnumbered two to one.
&quot;Pronger had a good performance on our field.&quot;
&quot;He cleared the puck, I picked up speed and Read went to the far end.&quot;
&quot;I tried to hit the puck and I&#39;m happy because I got it,&quot; Voráček described the last goal of the game as he lived it.
With their victory, Philadelphia has moved to the top of the Eastern Conference.
Montreal&#39;s Czech defender Jaroslav Špaček did not play until the end of the game against Buffalo, in the second third he withdrew with an upper body injury.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of experience in defense, but also by a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec failed to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost, the local coach lamented the large number of injuries in the back row, and playing the game with only five defenders.
&quot;That&#39;s bad&quot;.
&quot;We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were newcomers.&quot;
&quot;In short, but it is that nothing can be done against that, we have to deal with it,&quot; said Jacques Martin.
&quot;So much rotating players turned against us, we couldn&#39;t resist it.&quot;
&quot;We had to further simplify the game, get the puck out of our field.&quot;
&quot;And so we leave gaps,&quot; explained one of the defenders, PK Subban.
Goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty saves for Winnipeg in a 5:2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets&#39; goals were scored by five players, ending a five-game losing streak.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia at that time: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies at that time sold trips in most cases only to the socialist bloc, since trips to the West were highly restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on vacation to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both on the Black Sea) and to Hungary ( Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when travel to Yugoslavia was possible, however, after the Yugoslav regime leaned west and travel by Czech tourists was then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that citizens of the socialist bloc (ie also Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even in socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West in those days, but one had to get in line with a sleeping bag and spend the whole night like that, or have &quot;good acquaintances&quot; at the agency.
Even so, not everything was won.
The so-called &quot;promise of change&quot; which was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to &quot;politically unreliable people&quot;, who thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, and without a guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of the Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The Czech way of traveling has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was the ultimate holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million holiday trips to countries all over the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, that the currently favorite destination, Croatia, was not freely travelable until 1989, because it was part of Yugoslavia at that time.
In the early 1990s, visa exemptions were imposed to travel to neighboring Western European states, which led to a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not see themselves fed up with excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris groups of Czechs slept in the parks in tents, since our income at that time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or pension.
A typical characteristic of the Czechs at that time was taking food with them (canned food, sausages, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy western currency.
Our standard of living was rising and with it average wages, which around 1997 led to an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increase in the demand for travel, agencies began, from 1997 on a regular basis, to prepare trips using charter flight connections, which made the prices of trips drop dramatically compared to the past, thanks to the possibility to obtain discounts for the volume of passengers.
At the end of the 90s of the last century, the Czechs already traveled without a visa to almost all developed countries, except the USA, which further simplified our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened already in 2000, when the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country was organized thanks to huge demand, and it went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists have departed every year for distant and hot countries. This winter it will already be flown directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in the year 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US abolished visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008 the Czechs, for the first time in their history, spent more than half of their vacations abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than 15,000 kronor on trips abroad. checks per head, including expenses at the place of stay.
Ordinary General Assembly convened to elect the president, which could end up in deadlock again.
For almost five months, Czech football has been without a president and it is likely that the successor to Ivan Hašek as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) will not be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday. in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, you will not be able to vote even to choose between the three candidates.
Those interested in presiding over Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned from his position in June but not before calling his colleagues together with the aim of finding a strong person who would know how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the Hašek era concluded, a controversy broke out between the two association federations unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This became evident on September 16 when the new president had to be elected.
Delegates to the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní dům), located in the Prague neighborhood of Smíchov, because the talks had stalled, and not only regarding the method of election.
No consensus was reached as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only the legal representatives or also the delegates with full powers.
From that moment and due to this single point, a partial agreement was produced, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
Not even the Executive Committee could shed more light on the situation, which, in its ordinary or extraordinary meetings, basically did not resolve anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve center remains the same.
The question is this: how to proceed in the third round to avoid deadlock?
&quot;The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model,&quot; says Dušan Svoboda, one of FAČR&#39;s three vice-presidents, who, from the association&#39;s leadership, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will present his candidacy will win.
The Moravian Region is willing to reach a compromise so that the candidate with the highest total percentage of votes in both federations can win.
The Bohemian party, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two thirds.
&quot;This would, however, take away the meaning of the two previous rounds and would completely negate the concept of a bicameral system&quot;, this is how Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian party, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote under applicable statutes.
With what has been said, surprisingly, Tomaš Paclík also agrees, although it is assumed that the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all the candidates are more convenient for Pelta.
&quot;I would like to see the maximum vote in accordance with the statutes.&quot;
&quot;So that they don&#39;t come up with any nonsense about the representatives like in the last General Assembly,&quot; says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time as a candidate and who directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, the new president will be decided in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
&quot;All passions will be appeased by today&#39;s match of our national team in the European Championship.
&quot;Football will once again be the protagonist, and thus cooperation will be more comfortable,&quot; says the representative of Jablonice, who of the three candidates has the most experience in football management, both at a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
&quot;I hope an agreement is reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s not about the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to suit their own convenience.&quot;
&quot;This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly.&quot;
&quot;Still, I hope common sense will prevail,&quot; Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to come to an agreement.
Some negotiations had to take place in Montenegro, but who can know until the game starts if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, in which the vice presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, among others, had to travel to Podgorica, did not leave this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to find an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where it will take place the qualifying match.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, finally, could be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which, according to what they say, will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to bring the divided parties into the most powerful sports organization in the country so that an agreement can be reached.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sports Federation (ČSTV) that will try to give a new direction to Czech sports after the financial problems of the lottery house Sazka.
Paclík will fight to reach the presidency, because he cannot find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the Pilsen footballers, Tomaš Paclik, knew before the extraordinary General Assembly the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), he would not stand as a candidate for such an important position.
&quot;If there was a right person, I would be fighting for her and not running for election.&quot;
&quot;But until today no such person could be found,&quot; Paclík told the Czech News Agency (ČTK).
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the presumed winner of the election, which opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, if he wins, he would remain in the position of president only until 2013, when it would be the turn of the ordinary general assembly.
In that position he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too closely related to football events.
&quot;I&#39;ve already talked to a few people who I might keep in mind.&quot;
&quot;It was crazy for me to hear some say that right now they don&#39;t even want to identify themselves with Czech football.&quot;
&quot;I would like to change that vision,&quot; he adds.
What is reportedly bothering Paclík the most at the moment is Pelta&#39;s relationship with the President of the Pilsen Regional Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of the delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
&quot;In case he wins, the current status would be maintained and nothing in football will change.&quot;
&quot;With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will benefit even less,&quot; Paclík said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta&#39;s name was associated with a wiretap during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta got off scot-free.
&quot;I don&#39;t know what prestige to football Pelta&#39;s victory could bring.&quot;
&quot;And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us,&quot; said Paclík, also taking with some caution his earlier statement that he would &quot;sell Club Pilsen if Pelta becomes president.&quot;
In the case of winning the elections on Thursday, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
The other candidate, Rajchl, who was supported by Paclík before the General Assembly in September, which ended in a fiasco, shares the same opinion.
&quot;He (Pelta) would be the first one I would follow.&quot;
&quot;He is very capable.&quot;
&quot;I could imagine him, for example, as head of the representation.&quot;
&quot;but not as a manager of an association.&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t stick my nose in where I don&#39;t feel capable either,&quot; added Paclík, who drew a lot of attention in September for supporting the suspension of the Referees Committee chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
He resorts to his management skills in private companies, since since last summer he has also been the Director of Pilsen, which with his support celebrated the victory in the first division in May.
&quot;I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to its safe practice.&quot;
&quot;To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations,&quot; Paclík said without hiding his antipathy towards Sparta president Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it lobbied political leaders to allocate more money to sport from lottery taxes.
&quot;It&#39;s one of the key issues that the new president should address.&quot;
&quot;If they were to increase taxes on gambling, as the political parties announce, I would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going,&quot; he says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself states that the President of the FAČR must be &quot;non-partisan&quot;.
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
&quot;Not ideal.&quot;
&quot;But I see no point in hypocritically handing over my shares in the Pilsen Club to someone else and then going back there after a year and a half,&quot; Paclík said.
Pelta promised the FAČR new statutes that would end the deadlock in the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would guarantee that the FAČR had new statutes that would definitively serve to solve, in the future, controversies regarding electoral regulations.
The Jablonec representative is optimistic about the meeting this Thursday in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Already before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate at the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could serve him well to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on football management.
&quot;People at all levels have been involved in football for a long time and are looking forward to meeting the new President this Thursday.&quot;
&quot;They feel that the time has come for someone to run the association,&quot; thinks the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonice club but has worked at Sparta and on the association&#39;s executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hašek.
&quot;Unfortunately, in the General Assembly in June the statutes were approved, which were not as perfect as everyone thought.&quot;
&quot;If we exclude certain interpretations, we already have a president since September,&quot; warned Pelta.
Exactly the readaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as lure to win over the delegates.
&quot;If I am elected president, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am willing to respond if this fails.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a matter of principles, without which we cannot exist,&quot; says Pelta.
Also, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
He had already warned in the past that he saw himself collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his training in Law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It had been a long time since he had attacked Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, did not leave a puppet with a head.
&quot;He has been in the world of football for more than a year, and has already achieved some success.&quot;
&quot;His attacks were shameful and many people were shocked by the electoral campaign.&quot;
&quot;That is why many of them doubt his true character,&quot; he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements already announced in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest to the highest competitions.
The latter should be a showcase for football promotion.
&quot;Also, I would try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a consequence of the corruption scandal last year.&quot;
&quot;Immediately afterwards I would get involved in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for all of football,&quot; the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as football president would not entail any personal changes to the squad.
&quot;I would first have to know the tasks of each employee,&quot; he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, understandable nervousness reigns.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are predicted before the next general assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
&quot;If the only point of disagreement will be how to vote in the third round, we will certainly get past it.
&quot;Football needs credibility, which will only be recovered if it finally has a leader&quot;, still two days before the most decisive day in his representative career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, that under his leadership, the FAČR would start working hard.
If the current vice-president Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association at the fourth General Assembly, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that, if elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement systematic change and make executive committee members responsible for each area of football individually.
He also vows to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, get more money for football and continue the work started by previous president Ivan Hašek.
&quot;As president, I would like to dedicate myself completely to football.&quot;
&quot;From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the national team, through professional football or the training of high-performance young footballers.&quot;
&quot;By this I don&#39;t mean that I would do everything alone,&quot; Rajchl said in an interview for ČTK.
&quot;I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the executive committee in such a way that each member can dedicate himself to a specific area.&quot;
&quot;And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of momentum.&quot;
&quot;A lot of people probably won&#39;t like this, because it will mean starting to work really hard and not just criticize other people&#39;s work,&quot; he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he is said to have considered not running again as a candidate.
&quot;Everyone knows, I work 20 hours a day.&quot;
&quot;But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me that will prevent and hinder me at every step,&quot; he explained the reasons for his indecision.
&quot;Many people have told me that I shouldn&#39;t give up, because then others would give up too.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s about having faith not to give up like that, just like that,&quot; he said.
According to what they say, he is also motivated to continue the work that he already started with Hašek.
&quot;During those two years, a lot of work was done that I don&#39;t want to lose now.&quot;
&quot;There are processes that had been started and that will have their effect in a couple of years and I would not like someone to stop them,&quot; he announced, concerned that if they choose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association it could go back to the way it was before Hašek&#39;s time.
&quot;I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not capable of maintaining.
&quot;Behind him is, above all, all those people who would take care of football so that it was only a privilege for a select few.&quot;
&quot;I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not the fact that I&#39;m in favor of someone.&quot;
&quot;I try to be objective.&quot;
&quot;I want to make football for everyone, because only then will everyone feel good and not just the chosen ones,&quot; said Rajchl.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
&quot;Although some people try to claim otherwise, I have in mind to do the most for Moravia.&quot;
&quot;For example, it is time to think about the fact of dividing the second division into a Czech part and a Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first division.&quot;
&quot;The current situation where we have only three teams from Moravia would not happen, which is a problem for young Moravian players,&quot; Rajchl said.
Although Tomaš Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, joined the fight for the presidential elections, Rajchl does not stop believing in his chances of being elected.
&quot;I still feel I have strong support from the Czech Federation, which has elected me as its vice-president and knows that there are clear successes behind me,&quot; said Rajchl, whose successes include saving tens of millions of crowns from disadvantageous contracts, television contract negotiations and lottery law negotiations.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his part of the blame that the federation is not united.
And while he proclaims that Pelta is &quot;disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football&quot;, he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer football.
&quot;No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year.&quot;
&quot;In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Hašek has already started and not significantly change the staffing in the committees.&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t want to use that to my advantage,&quot; Rajchl assesses his rivals in this way.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
jump into the blue
by Julia Stanek
Pools from an incredible point of view, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Those who visit Europe can experience its blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is found in the water.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip over the past year and a half, there was one thing she couldn&#39;t miss in her luggage: a swimsuit.
Lying on her back in the water, she gazed up at the artistic dome overhead, swam toward the marble cherubs waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at the meticulously restored Art Nouveau indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, taking note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
The architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presents them in her recent book &quot;Badefreuden&quot;: the indoor swimming pools in Munich, the historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, the &quot;concrete constructions&quot; in the Taunus.
He made his &quot;trip through the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe&quot; through 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true fan of bathroom culture.
He wants nothing to do with the sport, says Meder, just the water is different.
It only annoys him that fans of bathing have to make do with blue tiles and the stench of chlorine, while fans of jogging can breathe in the fascinating smell of fir forests or listen to the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
&quot;One day I wondered why swimming pools always have to be so ugly,&quot; says the Viennese.
&quot;I started collecting nice pools.&quot;
The surface of the water duplicates the architecture.
The splash in the pool and the ethereal oils in the sauna. The wellness factor in swimming pools is so great because all the senses are catered to, according to Meder.
And if the builder works hard, indoor swimming pools can be a real treat for the eyes: &quot;Instead of a floor, in the bathrooms you have a surface of water.&quot;
&quot;On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building.&quot;
Everything folds optically: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the springboards.
The small-format photo book &quot;Badefreuden&quot; provides in 190 pages very interesting facts about architecture and art history in historic wellness oases, but above all it makes you want to jump into the blue.
Meder, the pool collector, discovers the outstanding specimens in her research in Hungary.
Alongside magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, there are nitrate-containing waters in a unique karstic cavity (cavity baths in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as thermal baths with alkaline water pools. and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city is turning its eyes to Zurich&#39;s indoor swimming pool, you can look out over snow-covered Arlberb from the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton, and: In In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary design awaits customers in Längenfeld: The Ötztal Water Cathedral looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
Steam rises from three open sources in winter, while the Ötztal mountains rise into the sky in the background.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, was not plagued by the smell of chlorine in all pools.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the baths of Árpád in Békescsaba, Hungary, the stench of diesel is so strong that people think they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose slime sticks to the skin when entering the pool, a special well-being experience.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in one place in her search for beautiful bathing spots, when she wanted to visit outdoor pools and sunbathing in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she came across a blocked terrain.
Architect Duan Jurkovic&#39;s 1902 bath was closed.
As Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red, white, and yellow modernist building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
Decadence counteracted in an enchanting pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These baths have three construction phases behind them; Not only can you discover Neo-Romanesque elements from the time it was built in 1844, but also an Alhambra-style Arab hall, added in 1900.
Since its painstaking modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace has been the favorite bath of swimming pool collector Iris Meder, and not just because she hails from the Black Forest.
&quot;There&#39;s a lot of merit in fusing different architectural styles into such a great unit,&quot; says Meder.
In such a palace, immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not matter much.
agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank analyzes the business of raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to test the consequences of speculation for the world&#39;s poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the matter is clear: according to a study, 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable that banks speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two thirds of those surveyed demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it intensifies the problems of the world&#39;s poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study builds on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity markets drives prices up, and banks take the blame for the world&#39;s hunger problem.
The consumer ombudsman&#39;s campaign is directed specifically at Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, betting on commodities was intended to protect traders from price swings.
Leading experts agree that players have become decoupled from supply and demand, profiting from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently than American competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business &quot;deserves to compromise Deutsche Bank&#39;s good name.&quot;
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to Deutsche Bank&#39;s board, along with a recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank&#39;s management will report the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: &quot;Betting on rising food prices shows in an especially dramatic way how ruthless banks are hurting public welfare today.&quot;
Ackermann ranks as the biggest banking lobbyist, especially in bonds.
&quot;Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it puts money for food price bets at stake,&quot; Bode said.
&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter if Ackermann deals with the subject of hungry people or the fame of Deutsche Bank.&quot;
Ackermann&#39;s inspection is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to present a perfect picture just a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board of directors will change something other than not planned in the board of directors.
By abandoning controversial agrarian speculation, he can improve his image.
And he needs to barely care about possible losses, that&#39;s what his successor will take care of.
Two thirds would cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch works hard to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the organization&#39;s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Barely 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were gambled.
Many of the bank&#39;s clients showed personal consequences when discovering that their bank was involved in such deals: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes from agrarian speculation.
43 percent would advise their acquaintances against such a bank, 49 percent would request, after reflection, to cancel their account and change to another institution.
House 21 in Vienna
The moved pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A story of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion at the 1958 Austrian World&#39;s Fair in Brussels won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, stood empty and fell into disrepair.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
Post-modern architecture fascinates, the clear shapes, the glass halls, the courageous curves and the new building materials, typical of the thinking about technical progress, for which the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the World&#39;s Fair Brussels of 1958 is an apt and familiar example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then won the Architecture Grand Prix for its light, floating steel and glass construction.
The construction is considered to this day a contemporary landmark of architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World&#39;s Fair.
With his legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the flattened adjacent building in Munich, he became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions, was erected after the World&#39;s Fair in the Schweizer Garten next to the Vienna South Station, was renovated in 1962 and a 20th-century museum was opened inside, it was called the &quot;house 20 &quot;.
The building was adequate but lacked the proper spaces and technology for a museum; without any wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere.
Despite this, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is increasingly decaying.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz renovated the pavilion, he now calls it &quot;house 21&quot; and it will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the belvedere museum, to which the house belongs, opened with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, has made a fresh start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor of art history with a considerable career including, among other things, an ice skater in her youth, later at Sotheby&#39;s, the Guggenheim Museum and founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, carried out the renovations with the At the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, he provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba from the eponymous foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookstore and an office building should also be built.
Tight control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do it.
Not only because he sensitively reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, expanded it and was awarded the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an &quot;important and immense place&quot;, in which he contemplated &quot;almost every weekend&quot; the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
There are big problems with the current renovations, the building was &quot;an energy hog&quot;, Krischanitz said.
The profile of the windows on the glass façade was changed, fiberglass reinforced insulating glass was installed and the glass roof was replaced with special security glass.
Thermal bridges and steel girders were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos roofs rehabilitated.
Two cellars were used for the new use, a light panel lowered between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
Original exterior doors remain, house is painted in antique mahogany tones and protected against rust.
And the movie theater is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the monuments office and a low budget.
&quot;I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked by the monument protection office,&quot; says Krischanitz, warning of a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.
The pavilion &quot;that came from Brussels&quot; has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical &quot;chance appearance in the history of the city.&quot;
Such an architecture is &quot;always in the wrong place&quot; and for this reason he wanted to &quot;awaken the right conscience&quot;.
In this case, house 21 is not in the wrong place, an urban windfall has occurred. The completely new and planned &quot;central station district&quot; with housing and offices is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And maybe another stroke of luck will happen: House 21 could receive a reinforcement from another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the temporary art room in Berlin and, as you hear, is negotiating with the city about a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans winter crisis package amounting to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would prevent train breakdowns in winter.
The number of personnel must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against train breakdowns and delays caused by winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The newspaper &quot;Bild&quot; informed, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, of the investments foreseen until 2005 of a total of around 300 million euros.
Therefore, better availability of vehicles and the rail network must be achieved even in extreme weather.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 positions to remove snow from the tracks and platforms.
The goal is to clear the platforms of snow and ice for operation and 90 percent of the points required for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train breakdowns and delays also this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in passenger transport, as, among other things, it lacked reservations due to adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for an authorization from the federal railway office.
In addition there is a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been regularly checking the axles of high-speed trains in the workshop for years, after a high-speed train suffered a broken axle at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions in fines in the US
After the tumult over President Josef Ackerman, a new problem appears for the USA, the Deutsche Bank must pay a million-dollar fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the US acquires the giant of the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in an agreement, to end the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five large credit unions during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial markets regulator NCUA accuses many large banks of inducing credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; have minimized the risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and drag the banks into the depths.
&quot;We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court,&quot; a Deutsche Bank spokesman said in New York.
The bank admits no fault with the settlement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which forced a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, welcomed the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for US credit unions and provides bankruptcy support to protect client investments.
The NCUA attempts to repay millions of losses incurred.
Deals currently closed are its first type.
The regulator had also held other big banks to account and in the summer brought lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the matter of dubious mortgage securities, they are called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, it wreaked havoc for many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, currently a difficult wind is blowing for US banks.
Investors and the inspection have filed countless processes to receive compensation or penalize faults.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the most lawsuits.
It reproaches the 18 large international banks for the fact that the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank is also suing the FHFA, dealing with businesses worth 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection demands that the Frankfurt Institute answer for &quot;substantial losses&quot;, without naming an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes $10 billion to IBM
Finance guru Buffett invests heavily in the Information Technology company IBM.
Since March, he has acquired shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
Until now, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always stated that he does not invest in computer or Information Technology companies since the forecasts for the long-term development of the companies are negative.
But you&#39;ve read the IBM business report and changed your mind about investing in the industry.
You should have understood long before that IBM mainly offers services and procures computer systems for the Information Technology departments of other companies.
In the financial world, a Warren Buffett investment is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive of Information Technology should be called &quot;Sir IBM&quot;.
Buffett currently revealed on business station CNBC that he has bought $10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway investment has thereby promoted it to one of IBM&#39;s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that IBM had not yet heard of the compromise.
He praised the management that dealt with ordinary profits in the economic crisis.
&quot;They&#39;ve done a terrific job,&quot; Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM established for some time lucrative Information Technology services such as the operation of data centers.
The over 100-year-old IT pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful equipment for companies.
Buffett has avoided technology companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose businesses he understood.
Instead, Buffett seized the opportunity on a freight train, at a lubricant manufacturer, or as a mechanical engineer.
His Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 of its own subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole series of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, grew it into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That is why it is an idol for countless investors from all over the world.
His quick and unerring sense of money has earned him the nickname &quot;Oracle of Omaha.&quot;
After Buffett&#39;s investment was discovered, IBM&#39;s shares on the stock market rose 1 percent.
&quot;The Blue Giant,&quot; as IBM is known, has a stock market value of more than $220 billion and ranks, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world&#39;s most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn&#39;t want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat materializes
After the discovery of the &quot;Zwickau cell&quot;, the Turkish media doubts the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a &quot;bloody ideology&quot; that is being revived again.
The murders of eight tricky and Greek small businessmen between 2001 and 2006 have a far-right background.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin, fear and concern have been reacted to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost believed to be dead a long time ago returns. Since the attacks in the form of arson in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there have been no more episodes of violence with an extreme right-wing background against Turks.
However, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The far-right network discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were far from foreseeable.
&quot;Is the bloody ideology revived again?&quot; headlines the online edition of the Turkish newspaper &quot;Haberturk&quot;.
On the contrary, the newspaper &quot;Sabah&quot; highlights that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant for the Federal Office for the Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the far-right Pantanal.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, remembering the victims of racist violence at the weekend with a vigil outside the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians reflected at a solemn ceremony for the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish agreement.
The coexistence was staged with bright colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information hit some Turkish media like a slap in the face: &quot;German 50th anniversary gift,&quot; says the headline of an article on the Turkish internet platform &quot;Haber X&quot;, referring to the background of the chain of murders.
The German broadcast &quot;Hürriyet&quot; does not insist on drawing this mental connection either.
&quot;It&#39;s starting to stink,&quot; reads the headline of Ahmet Külahci&#39;s column.
It highlights that those killed were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
On the internet forums for Germans of Turkish origin, the behavior of the police and their subsequent success in the searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are astonished that the German authorities did not search far-right circles for suspects much sooner.
Some are shown to be less rhetorical in terms of drastic means: &quot;From now on you lose here, the immigrants have nothing left but self-defense and weapons.&quot;
&quot;This will be the best self-protection.&quot;
&quot;The internal peace of Germany strongly depends on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network&quot;, writes &quot;Selen&quot;.
Which means that, if the internal peace of Germany is in danger, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen will be cleared up in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has burned into German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks who live here that there is a real threat and to the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks sharpen the group feeling of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press the inadequacy of the German policy after the attacks was mainly criticized at the time, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the Turks from Germany contribute with taxes.
It is clear how the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current information in the Turkish media once again shows how deep the mistrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country has been since then.
In addition to the effort of a comprehensive explanation and a reassessment of far-right terrorism in Germany, frank words are needed this time.
The Bank of Zurich Lake Scandal
The riskiest bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS nearly went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slid from one crisis to the next.
It is now run by a German.
Surely Axel Weber hadn&#39;t thought of that.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, it was revealed in July that in 2013 he would start in a new and almost equally spectacular job: Chairman of the board of the big Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber is publicly pleased, praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound strength, and drops kind remarks about his future colleagues.
&quot;USB has achieved a revitalization.&quot;
&quot;I am happy to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.&quot;
In September it became clear that everything would be totally different.
A USB financial operator in London bypassed all the bank&#39;s security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, CEO of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to go.
Since then, the president of the administrative council of the USB considered himself touched as well, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was learned that Weber should advise the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over as chairman of the board in May, not early 2013, as the bank announced Tuesday.
This is tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, an economics professor and counselor, and he has surely had a necessary period of adaptation.
Suddenly, he takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proven once again that it has been deserving of the title &quot;Europe&#39;s biggest scandal bank&quot; for a long time.
On the one hand, USB is huge, until recently the world&#39;s largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years now, it has slipped from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, so it seems, is saved from the once proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
USB had excellent fame until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid, but also crafty Swiss asset manager was combined with ambitious goals, he also wanted to be a big number in investment banks.
For one thing, at $1.6 trillion, USB handles more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank in the league of the big banks in the world.
This impresses.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later a banking professor in Zurich for many years explains: &quot;In front of my students, I have always described the USB as a model of a good bank.&quot;
&quot;From today&#39;s point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?&quot;
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong with the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was considered a brilliant and highly intelligent banker, surprisingly resigned.
Some months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank&#39;s investment fund embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to write off billions.
To bear this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, naturally scorned by some until recently: an opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund so discreet its name had never been heard.
This was just the first hit.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the administrative council, in 2006 on the second highest paid administrative council in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, due to its misguided investments, UBS found itself in financial crisis before bankruptcy and had to be bailed out by the state.
The national bank bought troubled securities from UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatorily convertible bond, whereby it became co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was affected, it was stated how dramatic this was for a small country, if it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times greater than the economic results of Switzerland (see graph).
&quot;We cannot bail out UBS again,&quot; said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America, agreeing to hand over the details of wealthy clients who had possibly cheated on taxes with the bank&#39;s help.
In addition, it approves a figure of 780 billion dollars, reimbursement of unjustified benefits of these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, UBS more or less confessed to having assisted in the tax fraud.
Simultaneously, he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for rich clients: the aura of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board of directors and the chairman of the administrative council.
And the exodus of client funds.
In this way, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two core sectors: in investment banking through erroneous speculation and in asset management through aiding tax fraud.
And just when it was getting a little calmer again, just when you thought UBS was doing it again, this unfortunate trader story happens, an individual trader defrauded €1.7 billion, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it was revealed, apparently, this still doesn&#39;t work well with risk management in investment banking.
&quot;The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little,&quot; says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: &quot;The problem with UBS is that it does not master risk controls.&quot;
So the idea of caution arose, with which the Swiss bankers presented themselves for a long time, to be the guardians of the greatest assets in the world: no risk is too great, on the other hand, the security of money wants to go bankrupt on the other side of the alpine republic
Swiss bank safety deposits were the symbol of unwavering reliability, like Lindt and Sprüngli of real chocolate.
UBS&#39;s head office in Zurich doesn&#39;t fit the cliché of a solid Swiss private bank, it&#39;s just a bit older.
The situation is classic.
The bank&#39;s headquarters are on Zurich&#39;s Bahnhofstraße, which leads from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rents are some of the highest in Europe.
Here you can find jewelry stores like Tiffany`s among traditional Swiss shops like the Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have resided here for years: from the national bank, through the Palace of Credit Suisse, to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS reception room is entered through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are lined with marble, in front are large leather armchairs, next to the bank&#39;s logo there is a large sign to indicate &quot;security&quot;.
UBS knows what the client is looking for here: Security.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point either displaced the idea of the big Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank opines.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both big banks.
UBS has gotten too big, he says, mainly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
There the Swiss had nothing more to say.
&quot;And they have long been accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons.&quot;
In fact, UBS changed Anglo-Saxon investment banking, delivered its first big profit and then disaster struck, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the big Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
&quot;On that Wednesday the coalition government of the small country of seven million decided on the biggest rescue operation in the history of their nation,&quot; writes author Lukas Hässig in his book &quot;Der UBS-Crash&quot; (&quot;UBS Crash&quot; in Spanish ).
Politicians conceded up to 68 billion francs or roughly 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do they come up for that?
They talk to the Swiss bankers, that&#39;s how they see the problem in the dimension of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three big Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank that was too big for little Switzerland due to the merger arises and continues to grow.
So it served for the two different precursor banks of the UBS to complement each other: a rich but sleepy bank with the center of asset administration in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a great financial bicycle.
There are two names associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the administrative council.
&quot;I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team,&quot; says banking expert Hans Geiger.
&quot;Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive one who managed to work his way from bench learning to the top.&quot;
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: &quot;He thought his models were real,&quot; says Geiger.
&quot;It is a tragic case.&quot;
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: the nonsense came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same slogan: Dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They topped the &quot;League Tables&quot;, the rankings that then documented the success of the banks.
UBS wanted to be at the top.
Some steps went well.
In currency trading and stock trading he was at the top.
However, the business advisers in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the language of &quot;fixed income&quot; banking, there is enormous compensation for the big banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS began an adventure that nearly cost it its very existence.
Eager for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of its high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It became a powerful machine for securitizing American mortgage loans and then selling them, keeping certain risks at its own expense.
And also, like other banks, it sought a drop for a long time.
&quot;In the summer of 2007, as the US housing market was on fire, UBS bought there,&quot; said Geiger, a banking expert.
The euphoria is so great, the fall is so deep.
A manager had to leave as the attempt to order turned out to be more complicated than they expected.
The positions at UBS became projectable seats and are insecure to this day.
Currently, who runs a large bank, has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Banking expert Geiger has an idea, end investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn&#39;t want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking needs to slow down a lot, it&#39;s now clear.
The following Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In reality, the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was only thought of as a temporary solution, as the bank surprisingly parted ways with its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he has imposed himself: He must permanently run the business of UBS, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-nineties.
Eliminate 3,500 positions.
But this is not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to earn money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is surely asking himself today.
So far he only says that he will first look for a house with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US stock market
The impending recession in Europe has scared US investors at the beginning of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remain without effect.
The halted industrial production on the continent stifles hopes of stabilizing a crisis caused by indebtedness at its source.
General relief may not be imposed on changes of government in Rome and Athens.
The euro fell against the dollar.
In the past week, the Italian and Greek glass has looked half full, not half empty, but now the problems are coming to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, financial assets appear on the sales list.
The Dow Jones index of standard stocks closed down 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.

The companies produced in September two percent less than the previous month, as reported by the Eurostat statistical office.
Which created skepticism among US investors: &quot;We are not an island, we are dependent,&quot; said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be released from a recession as quickly, plus there are more signs of weakness in the banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this caution, it is still not clear if Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview for CNBC.
Therefore, from their point of view, it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, it throws a decade of old principles overboard and enters the American tech sector.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supports the share price of the traditional consortium and makes it trade against the market trend at first only a percentage higher.

Clever jackdaws spread in cities
In many places, jackdaws are considered &quot;problem birds&quot;: these highly intelligent animals are not being driven out of cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, jackdaws have been part of the image of the city for years, but in many municipalities complaints from neighbors are piling up about the filth and noise of the animals.
Although no means against &quot;problem birds&quot; have appeared so far.
Jackdaws no longer leave the cities, experts say at the first jackdaw symposium in Leer, East Frisia.
There specialists from all over the national territory discuss possible solutions.
They look for alternatives in the cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of the cities to the migration from the countryside of certain protected rooks; chemical applications in agriculture are visibly destroying traditional living spaces.
Hunting, the increasing construction and the fall of trees that host them make life difficult for birds.
The jackdaws are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project to mass-kill the district&#39;s rooks made negative headlines.
Critics have called the hunting of animals by trapping birds and killing them with sticks especially brutal.
&quot;Ejecting them and driving them away in the normal way does not achieve anything,&quot; said Werner Klöver, urban planner and landscape designer from Leer.
Shooting nests with water or knocking down trees are often unintended consequences, also says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
&quot;The animals stray, the large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere.&quot;
Scaring them away is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
&quot;We must live with them, we don&#39;t catch them anymore.&quot;
Without the surroundings, the problem in cities is not solved, says Wolfgang Kellner, Mayor of Leer.
A combination of driving animals away from sensitive residential areas and baiting them back to settle elsewhere is possible.
&quot;Information boards instead of chainsaws&quot; Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist, advertises against the fact that animals are treated in a completely different way: &quot;The best thing is that we can take a pike in the face with aplomb.&quot;
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger Jackdaw Teaching Circuit in Schleswig-Holstein, where signs inform about the life of the intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own take on the criticism of bird noise: &quot;It&#39;s all forms of communication, they have a lot to say.&quot;
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the jackdaws not only take advantage of the resources to access schist morsels, but also make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists from the University of Cambridge verified how far the intelligence of birds goes in four jackdaws.
In one experiment, birds quickly learned that they had to drop a rock on a platform to hit a moth larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape the stone had to be to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, the cunning jackdaws had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beaks.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the bucket into the tube handle.
Three of the four jackdaws got it on the first try.
Portugal at Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and the Turks have no hope of the championship.
Favorites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be at Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed the last tickets for Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Guided by the triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal thrashed Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after the 0-0 first leg, made the five Euro Cup appearances in a row.
The Czechs managed 1-0 (0-0) in the second leg of the play-offs with the outsider Montenegro, after in the first leg (2-0) they made things clear.
Croatia did not let them score in the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland got a weak 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other goals for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) brought Bosnia within twice.
Sena Lulic got a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 World Cup play-offs in South Africa.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal started perfectly.
Ronaldo executed a direct free kick from more than 30 meters to move into the points lead.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his skills to score from distance and made it 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not excel in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to striker Edin Dzeko.
The former player of the Wolfsburg team, leader of English Manchester City sent a header to the post, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek scored for the Czech Republic
Next, the referee Wolfgang Stark, from Ergolding, was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for falling to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark awarded a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic converted.
After the break, the 2004 European vice-champion clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs put an end to the last doubt in the 81st minute with a goal from Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European champion qualifies for the fifth consecutive time for the Eurocup.
Coach Michal Bilek&#39;s team with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a second of reaction in the opening phase.
At the last moment, goalkeeper Petr Cech reflexively avoided a possible own goal by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had a better chance with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the return of the front, very right in Cech&#39;s goal.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the crossbar of the world-famous goalkeeper, the FC Seoul striker got away again (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the match.
Meanwhile, Türkiye missed out on the football wonder of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not go beyond 0-0 in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink was almost certain to leave his third-place bench seat at the 2002 World Cup, the Croats celebrated their fourth appearance in the Eurocup final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got off to a dream start.
In the seventh minute and with a shot from long distance, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the post. Attacker Kazim Kazim was also unable to send the ball into the goal.
After the second of reaction, Croatia took more and more control.
After the break, Croatia did not let any goal be scored.
Along with VfL Wolfsburg&#39;s Mario Mandzukic, who made room for Dortmund&#39;s Ivan Perisic in the 62nd minute, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are Bundesliga legionnaires in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the Eurocopa
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate the first participation in the Eurocopa since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni&#39;s team, which triumphed 4-0 in the first leg prepared for an early decision, into the lead on 32 minutes.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied with the invited team.
Ireland pressed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Los Angeles Galaxy&#39;s Robbie Keane had his first big chance.
From the first moment, the Estonian defense avoided possible advantage goals.
But in the 32nd minute he overtook him.
After a defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball across the line, making it 1-0.

SAP wants to double its number of employees in China
SAP, the largest software manufacturer in Europe, invests billions in the next few years in China and wants to almost double its number of employees in the country.
Until 2015 approximately two billion dollars (approximately 1.5 billion euros) will circulate, the dax consortium reported on Tuesday.
&quot;We will get more research and development facilities and hire workers,&quot; Bill McDermott, co-chairman, told a conference in Beijing.
The staff must grow from 2,500 workers currently to 4,500.
The number of branches of the international market leader for business software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of SAP&#39;s more than 176,000 international customers are based in the boom country.
Growth plans in China are also an important element of the dax consortium&#39;s 2012 strategy.
SAP wants to increase its sales volume by 2015 to 20 billion euros.
Last year it entered approximately 12.5 billion euros.
Today the software provider&#39;s business, which employs 50,000 people worldwide, is doing as well as it has seldom been in the past.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
&quot;Currently we want to expand our activities (...)&quot;, explained McDermott.
&quot;Our goal is to activate lasting growth in China through extensive training.&quot;
Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund&#39;s powerful and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate Story of World War I, &quot;opens with a long dramatis personae of the sort that can make even one&#39;s soul falls to the feet.
Here are some action tips: Gently tear out this page and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund&#39;s novel narrative, and this dramatis personae will function as your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of their men and women, you are confused and helpless in the fog. from the war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which he rightly describes as &quot;a work of anti-history.&quot;
It contains some notable names, important treaties, or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, fancy journalists, or discussions of tactics or materiel.
It&#39;s not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as &quot;a book about how it happened.&quot; It deals with &quot;feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods.&quot;
&quot;The Beauty and Pain of Battle&quot; combines the wartime experiences of 20 or so ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and clerks.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their limbs, go mad, or die.
Their lives flicker here like votive candles lit in a church; new ones are added to the mix while others fade away.
Mr. Englund&#39;s book is a departure from standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that World War I was just disastrous trench warfare on the Western Front.
&quot;The Beauty and Pain of Battle&quot; moves expertly through other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are hit by beehives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the start.
War floods these people&#39;s lives like a natural catastrophe, a Hurricane Katrina that reeks of cordite.
When artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman at home with your children, do you stay or run?
Anyway, who&#39;s coming?
Almost no one understands what is happening, not even why this war has to be fought.
&quot;The lack of facts,&quot; observes Mr Englund, &quot;has been filled with guesswork, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours.&quot;
&quot;The Beauty and Pain of Battle&quot; follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor in the high seas fleet.
Their stories have been obtained for the most part from previously published memoirs, letters, and other material.
Explanations of their lives can be frightening or moving, but they are most alive in Mr. Englund&#39;s accumulation of small moments, missing details.
Many of these are about deprivation and making do with what you have.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl she says: &quot;Substitutes, substitutes everywhere.&quot;
&quot;Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons.&quot;
He goes on to talk about substitute food in Germany.
It describes &quot;meat made from rice cooked and pressed in mutton fat (and topped with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from dried potato roots and peelings; shoes with wooden soles.&quot;
There are, he notes, &quot;837 permitted meat substitutes in sausage production, 511 registered coffee substitutes.&quot;
Some stories are about honor and valor.
An American acknowledges his own impulse toward savagery and says of the war: &quot;You feel that after all this is what men are made for and not to sit in armchairs with a cigar and a whiskey,&quot; the newspaper of the late or a best seller, and pretend that that veneer signifies civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that starched and studded bib.&quot;
Instead a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will know or care.
&quot;Once one is resigned to the thought of sacrificing oneself, one would like to think that it could happen in front of the public,&quot; he writes.
Instead, it&#39;s horribly akin &quot;to a convict being secretly strangled.&quot;
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new kinds of terror.
&quot;The conflict has become more and more an economic competition,&quot; writes Mr Englund, &quot;a war between factories.&quot;
It reflects the arrival of what he calls &quot;a new species in the bestiary of the turn of the century: the eloquent, ideologically convinced mass murderer in well-tailored clothes who does his butchery while sitting behind a desk.&quot;
People behave in unexpected ways; there is both ignoble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund tells of soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes as a way of evading front service.
&quot;The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and smear with it on their genitals in the hope of ending up in hospital,&quot; he writes.
&quot;Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, often resulting in lifelong blindness.&quot;
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund&#39;s lithe but not extravagant prose is perfectly suited to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way in which the war has &quot;unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.&quot;
People start asking why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, like Paul Fussell&#39;s The Great War and Modern Memory, or novels like Erich Maria Remarque&#39;s All Quiet on the Front, rather than full-length histories.
Mr. Englund&#39;s volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
Your book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I will not reveal it.
But it is as if he had come from his book, torn that page of dramatis personae from between your fingers, and burned it with a match.
After a previous misstep, a planned assault to the minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be emptier.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers, initially telling others that they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was at the center, his presence underscoring how the operation was fraught with challenges for the police department.
There was no repeat of the episodes of recent weeks, such as the pepper spraying of protesters, in violation of department rules and creating a storm of public sympathy for squatters.
And so the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had prepared themselves by seeing how the occupations had developed in other cities.
A major catastrophe drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye on Zuccotti.
Agents increased so-called riot training -- counterterrorism measures that involved rapidly mobilizing large numbers of police officers -- to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to enter the park came at the &quot;last minute,&quot; said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the mission only as &quot;an exercise.&quot;
&quot;The few cops I know who were called for this were not told it was to get into Zuccotti Park,&quot; said the person, who spoke anonymously.
&quot;The only people who knew they were going to get into Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department.&quot;
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, officers wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday&#39;s operation involved officers from various police units, including special forces from across the municipal district - dozens of mobile officers who routinely flooded high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, such as those who commute to work, had been going to and from the park throughout the day, making 1 am a good time to enter.
&quot;It was appropriate to do it when there were the least number of people in the park,&quot; he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Services Unit with spotlights and loudspeakers congregated at the intersection of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages blaring from the loudspeakers appeared to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs officers went to the park in their light blue windbreakers, many protesters just packed up and left.
No tents were touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen assembling at the perimeter to get in if arrests were needed in the park.
The journalists in the park were forced to leave it.
Paul J. Browne, the Police Department&#39;s chief spokesman, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said that attempts were made to prevent them from seeing the police go into action in the park, and that they had been treated roughly by officers.
Mr Browne said mobile TV units in Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As police moved west through the dense tangle of protesters&#39; personal effects, including luggage and paper and plastic trash bags crammed with clothing, teams from the Cleaning Department followed, picking up what was left. left behind
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, images surfacing online shortly after.
A core group of protesters took up positions near the camp kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police entered to arrest them methodically.
Around 10 people in the epicenter of the camp locked each other by the arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service agents were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made at the park until about 3:30 am, Mr. Kelly said.
The clearance operation was complete about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said some 142 people were arrested at the park.
Most of the arrests were for &quot;disturbing public order and resisting authority,&quot; he said.
The most senior officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the department head, the senior uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department&#39;s chief of detectives, was also there.
Mr Kelly, while he was present, &quot;was not directing operations&quot;, said Mr Browne.
A second group of officers waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar streets, in case they needed to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, one block north of the park, and on Pine Street, one block south.
From those positions, police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of officers, many with shields, were seen pushing people outside.
There were about 28 people in the northern perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
At around 5 am, south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen removing air from the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood went flying from the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a protester were hospitalized.
Support workers union to sue city over layoffs
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city Wednesday, alleging the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon at the disposal of the union, of the 37th municipal district, in its effort to overturn the firings.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the lowest paid in the city lost their jobs on October 7, in a move that union leaders have described as political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, access by the city to a health care fund run by task forces to close its budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied that accusation.
At a City Hall hearing last month, Education Counselor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were a part of the budget passed in June.
A board member countered by telling him that nothing in the budget specified that the school&#39;s support staff members would be laid off.
Borough District 37 officials said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued. A press conference will be held Wednesday to announce the official filing of the lawsuit, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the city&#39;s Department of Education as defendants, and lists eight fired workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are Black or Latino women, as are most attendees who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city&#39;s Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in poor parts of the city to support a claim of unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more attendees, because who had been chronically underfunded.
It notes that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and a few layoffs at schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Considering the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, &quot;This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit.
PS District 36&#39;s budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each poor student enrollment in schools.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by language in a memo authorizing the firing of parent coordinators.
The memo used the word &quot;surplus&quot; to describe the action, although &quot;surplus&quot; more often describes the act of moving a teacher from a school&#39;s payroll to a labor exchange, whose salaries are paid by the office. central.
&quot;Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired,&quot; the draft complaint says, &quot;and not just redundant.&quot;
Mission finished, Congress ready to reach a deal on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are ready to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and assassinated, and US involvement to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by Chairman John Kerry (D-Mass.), joined by Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent, Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and the US troops for their &quot;courage&quot;.
&quot;This resolution is to honor the brave Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country,&quot; Kerry said.
&quot;It is an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.&quot;
The language may sound innocuous, but nothing about the Libya debate has so far been easy.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties were squabbling with each other and with the White House over the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the US military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, never reaching a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill was defeated in the House, the chamber also rejected a measure that would have cut funding for US operations in Libya.
That left the US mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with Congress angry enough to criticize Obama&#39;s handling of the mission, but not angry enough to actually mow the grass from under its feet.
Then the indecision of Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee resolution &quot;congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resilience in freeing themselves&quot; and &quot;commends the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism&quot;.
The resolution also &quot;declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.&quot;
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs committee, or will it divide lawmakers as the June bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the top Republican on the committee.
Lugar&#39;s spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House is set to vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue to actually achieve a full House or Senate vote in this Congress.
Other lawmakers have so far been unsuccessful in getting their amendments through the assembly, but not for lack of trying.
Goodlatte&#39;s is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicates - the same bill is proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others with slight variations from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balancing budget amendment in the House alone, and another handful that will &quot;control federal spending.&quot;
Some of those bills are also identical to one another, but they give their sponsors -- especially fledgling Republicans looking to hone their résumés -- a chance to brag that they &quot;authored&quot; the bill.
The Budget Control Act, which passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on a balancing budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms members of Congress can serve, while Rep. José E. Serrano (D-NY) wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat-Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment banning gay marriage is a perennial proposal, as is one banning flag burning.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be overturned if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
As enthusiastic as members have been in proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in years past.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to the 1990s, when members regularly tabled more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren&#39;t much more successful then than they are now.
The last amendment to be added - Amendment 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
&quot;Hit but not beaten,&quot; Giffords speaks in her first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after she was shot at point-blank range by a gunman at a Tucson constituent rally, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) appeared on national television Monday night, singing along to the Broadway tune &quot;The Sun Will Come Up Tomorrow.&quot; and he said he wanted to recover more than he wanted to return to Congress.
In her appearance on ABC News &quot;20/20,&quot; with Diane Sawyer, Giffords was struggling to form sentences and needed help walking.
The show documented his difficult path back from the damage inflicted by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, passing from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he made a surprise return to the House to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling deal.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as &quot;difficult.&quot;
Asked by Sawyer how he&#39;s feeling, Giffords, 41, replied: &quot;Pretty good.&quot;
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long &quot;20/20&quot; special, which aired on the eve of the publication of the couple&#39;s new book, &quot;Gabby: A story of courage and hope.
The special program discussed Giffords&#39; recovery from the January 8 shooting.
In videos taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with a shaved head and a long scar across her forehead.
She can only hold one or two fingers up while her husband encourages her.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
A movement of the head.
A puckering of the lips.
And then, his first word: &quot;What.&quot;
Within days, Giffords uttered another word - &quot;toast,&quot; a request for a change to his breakfast menu.
Videos released by ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords&#39; recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing Cyndi Lauper&#39;s &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot; and Tom Petty&#39;s &quot;Free Falling&quot; along with therapists.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who does two hours of therapy every day, said he doesn&#39;t remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading a newspaper article about the March 12 murder to Giffords when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
&quot;A lot of people died,&quot; Giffords told Sawyer.
&quot;Hard, hard, hard.&quot;
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point in his wife&#39;s recovery, she said, &quot;I&#39;ve been defeated.&quot;
&quot;So, I told her, &#39;Gabby, you haven&#39;t been beaten,&#39;&quot; Kelly said.
&quot;You&#39;ve just been hit.
And you&#39;re going to get out of this, and you&#39;re going to bounce back and you&#39;re going to come back stronger than ever.&quot;
Troops make you feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration, and loss.
At that moment, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines stormed their posts around him.
The black-tie crowd rose to their feet and applauded.
&quot;Men and women were considered heroes,&quot; said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A senior military officer at the gala, also known as then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
&quot;They were shown as some kind of orphan child,&quot; the officer wrote in an email.
I&#39;m sure the organizers meant well.
I know they had them.
But it wasn&#39;t respect, really. It was pity.
The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the rocky relationship that has gripped the military and an often distant, sometimes adoring American public.
The troops are lavished with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise comes with a price, service members say.
The public increasingly acts as if they were sorry for those in uniform.
&quot;We are not victims at all,&quot; said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
&quot;But it seems the only way for some to show their support is to put us in the role of forlorn souls.&quot;
The issue is a very sensitive one for military leaders, who don&#39;t want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by returning troops in the final years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most pity talks take place quietly and privately among veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting in the Marine Corps, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside of the military would view their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of dread as they faced insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there was an &quot;angry and violent veteran below the surface,&quot; said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to hold up under the pressure of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
&quot;When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions,&quot; Cancian recalled telling his children.
Military unrest arises, in part, from America&#39;s indifference to wars.
Battlefield achievements are rarely singled out for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
&quot;We as a nation no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in World War II,&quot; said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, praise from politicians and the public largely focuses on the depth of a service member&#39;s suffering.
Troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military faces mounting pressure to end rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged inaction in the face of rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
PFC Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his barracks at Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend when he ran into a colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if he could join her in her room for a drink.
&quot;It sounded an alarm bell,&quot; says Lyman.
However, the Texan native put her concern aside.
I thought, no, he&#39;s 19.
&quot;He&#39;s from Texas,&quot; he says.
&quot;I wish I had listened to my instincts.&quot;
Within minutes of entering Lyman&#39;s room, the man approached her from behind, pulling her down and raping her, she alleges.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel are anxiously awaiting a court decision in a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether their lawsuit against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce widespread rape among the military, in violation of soldiers&#39; constitutional rights.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, DC attorney, the lawsuit initially implicated 17 plaintiffs but grew to 28 in the months that followed: 25 women and three men, all of whom claim they were raped or sexually assaulted by their partners. and that the military failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says he&#39;s going after the army staff, because the problem starts with them.
&quot;The military is a top-down structure,&quot; he says.
&quot;Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The high command.&quot;
Burke also says that since February, she has been contacted by about 400 other survivors, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
His strategy: Instead of piling all the plaintiffs into this case, putting all his eggs in one basket, so to speak, he&#39;s going to file multiple cases, if necessary, to keep up the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by US Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, spell out the defense strategy -- in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
Per a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries suffered by active duty personnel.
&quot;The alleged damages are part of the plaintiffs&#39; military service,&quot; the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment for this article.
Things have changed since the 50s.
While women are still officially prohibited from serving in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern warfare rarely has clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in reaching out to local women in war zones.
The result: Between those two wars, 150 female soldiers have died, two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It&#39;s time for the military to modernize, too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her fight, and three other lawsuits are underway, in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
Separately, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a lawsuit against the military that focuses on the &quot;personality disorder&quot; diagnoses assigned to rape victims in order to get them discharged from the service - a common occurrence, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles benefit claims for people who say they were sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of fixes.
In 2010 there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Defense Department&#39;s Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
However, the assaults are markedly underreported, and by the Pentagon&#39;s own estimates, they put it at approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, released in March, also examines prosecution rates: In 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military went to trial - half that in the civilian justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke&#39;s case describe his attacks as just the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman&#39;s case, she reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he says, he was asked to recount the details of his rape 11 separate times to a crowd of police officers, doctors, and commanders.
She submitted to a rape kit, and her attacker&#39;s blood - from a cut on her arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which she was asked about having sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as personality witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
&quot;I remember the day the verdict was read,&quot; Lyman says.
&quot;I thought I was going to go to work -I found myself yelling from the living room.&quot;
&quot;They put me in the psych unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, &#39;That wasn&#39;t his trial. That was my trial.&#39;
Lyman was ordered to see a military psychiatrist, who ultimately diagnosed her with a personality disorder, rendering her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was released from service under less-than-honorable terms, which prevents her from receiving any benefits.
As for whether the case brought by Lyman and his fellow lawsuits goes ahead, that&#39;s a long shot, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he notes, &quot;In my opinion, they should be able to keep going.&quot;
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it doesn&#39;t have the same incentive and deterrent that accountability poses.
He adds: &quot;The odds are heavily against them...but it&#39;s important for them to try.&quot;
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn&#39;t go her way, Burke, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, will queue up her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
&quot;We are going to continue fighting the army on this issue until the reform takes place,&quot; he says.
&quot;Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before he became the new face of the far-right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another guy airing his anti-immigration views online.
Breivik, who admitted to carrying out a massacre in Norway in July that left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing on Monday.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time leading up to his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalist supporters of right-wing groups online. social.
After this summer&#39;s tragedy, investigators wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just log in to Facebook.
&quot;We found it wasn&#39;t that hard to reach them,&quot; says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by UK think tank DEMOS.
Facebook&#39;s cache of personal information is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to pinpoint their desired demographics with scientific precision — the way marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett&#39;s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then targeted ads at them, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future.
By reaching out via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
&quot;It&#39;s a whole new way of doing research,&quot; says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male, and angry about immigration.
However, in a twist of sorts, &quot;those who combine their online activism with their offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen.&quot;
DEMOS&#39;s work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in likes, wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook&#39;s &quot;data supernova&quot; is spawning a research boom, driving the number of scholarly papers with the site&#39;s name in the title up to almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn&#39;t approach with a folder on the street.
&quot;Before, when you tried to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.&quot;
&quot;You&#39;d have to go through the party, and they&#39;d never let you in,&quot; says Bartlett.
&quot;Facebook removes all of that - you go to them directly.&quot;
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address social-health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and colleagues found that college students who discussed their drunken exploits on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of problem drinking than students who they remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that the students&#39; peers, such as residential counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who posts too many binge status updates.
&quot;You can&#39;t treat a problem if you can&#39;t diagnose it,&quot; Dimitri Christakis, Moreno&#39;s co-author and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children&#39;s Research Institute, told the Washington Post.
&quot;We have found a way to identify at-risk children who would otherwise go undiagnosed.&quot;
Facebook is also constantly &quot;probing&quot; its own population for data.
The site&#39;s Data Team has produced statistics on relationship status and Valentine&#39;s Day, expected voter turnout midway through the 2010 legislative term, and a National Happiness Index (primarily using data from can access - longtime advocates of digital freedom who argue that the site should make its vast amounts of data available to others for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - the sacrifice of being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don&#39;t even know about?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is an open bar for everyone.
&quot;I don&#39;t think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be looking at their profiles,&quot; says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London&#39;s Knowledge Lab, of a 2006 study he carried out on the walls. student Facebook audiences.
&quot;As far as they were concerned, it was just between them and their friends.&quot;
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it&#39;s impossible to know which part of a user&#39;s profile information and wall posts are true.
&quot;What you say on Facebook and what you do off of Facebook are two completely different things,&quot; says Selwyn.
That&#39;s why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a clipboard and pen are still the best investigative tools anyone can use.
&quot;There&#39;s no substitute for getting into the real world and talking to real people,&quot; he says.
&quot;Social research is supposed to be about the social - and a lot of the social still happens offline.&quot;
&quot;Cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to masterminding the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a &quot;resistance&quot; fighter during his first public appearance in Oslo court.
&quot;I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Norwegian Knights Templar,&quot; he told a packed room of 500 people.
&quot;I oppose the court, as it was mandated by organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism.&quot;
&quot;I acknowledge the facts but I do not plead guilty.&quot;
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because he &quot;did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views.&quot;
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a prewritten speech, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for a further 12 weeks, banned him from the media for four weeks, and said authorities would have to keep a tight rein on all visits and correspondence for eight weeks. .
Around 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is being held on lockdown.
All attended with the goal of moving toward completion.
&quot;I thought it seemed cold and inhuman,&quot; a Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
&quot;It was awkward, but for me it was a step up after seeing and hearing the suspect.&quot;
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing, meeting reporters and survivors in the eye as he entered and exited the building.
Despite Breivik&#39;s strange notion of being part of a larger &quot;resistance&quot; movement, the judge ruled that he is not mentally ill, saying there is no evidence that he was abetting.
Some may take comfort in the fact that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that doesn&#39;t automatically ease the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
&quot;I would like it to look like a monster, but it doesn&#39;t,&quot; said a relative of a victim.
&quot;It would be so much easier if it looked like it.&quot;
7 Lessons From Lost Steve Jobs Interview Shown In Theater This Week
Following the death of Steve Jobs on October 5th, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the technological genius as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing, in a recently rediscovered Jobs interview dusted off in advance of a series of special screenings in major markets this week, is just how much this creative mind understood about the processes. sales and product workflows.
He was certainly a self-acknowledged designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and flowchart junkie - a man who believed that many executives suffered from &quot;a disease of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of work... [but] there is an enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product.&quot;
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing The Triumph of the Nerds television series about the dawn of the personal computer, and he sat down with Jobs for over an hour for a long and rare conversation.
At that point, it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced out of Apple, and he was already hard at work at his new computer company NeXT, hoping for popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringely&#39;s interview was used in Nerds, he said that the originals of the interview disappeared during transport.
It was only after Jobs&#39; death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director&#39;s garage.
This slightly re-edited archival footage is the basis for the 68-minute Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which hits Landmark Theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expound on his technology philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are long silences between questions and answers - 10 to 15 seconds of musing, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also moments when Jobs&#39;s perfectionism surfaces, where he seems impatient with Cringely&#39;s questions, prompting him to move faster to the more important issues or arguments.
Shot before the era of Pixar, the iPod, or the iPhone, there&#39;s something strangely prescient about The Lost Interview, as Jobs weighs in on what he sees other companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
It&#39;s one thing to read posthumous assessments of Jobs&#39;s career, but there&#39;s something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here, the eager dreamer on the brink of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining it all in detail here, he went and did it.
A quick recap of seven notable sequences from The Lost Interview:
On how he learned to run a business:
&quot;Throughout my years in the business, I always asked, &#39;Why do you do things?&#39; and the answers you get invariably are, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s just the way it&#39;s done.&quot;
Nobody knows why they do what they do, in business nobody thinks about things very deeply.
That&#39;s what I found.
Jobs details his efforts to simplify Apple&#39;s accounting.
Baffled by the way costs were recorded - often starting with a &quot;standard cost&quot; that was done by eye, then adjusted with a &quot;variable&quot; - he developed an automated factory that claimed they could determine costs retail commercials.
On the prank on the Pope:
Jobs recounts the &quot;Blue Box&quot; he built himself with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack into the phone company and make free long-distance calls.
The device has been widely written about, but Jobs&#39; euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a pay phone, making a call, then connecting from one AT&amp;T network to another, while looping as many satellites as possible.
&quot;We were wrapping things around the world a half dozen times and you&#39;d yell into the pay phone and come back a minute later to the pay phone next door,&quot; Jobs says with a chuckle.
&quot;We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.&quot;
The two of us, we didn&#39;t know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing - it was an incredible lesson, and I don&#39;t think Apple would have ever existed without it.
Jobs goes on to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost gave up on, calling the Vatican via Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak to the Pope, while doing his best Henry Kissinger impression.
As various members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the US diplomat, the two burst out laughing just before the Pope himself was awakened to go answer the phone.
On falling in love with technology (and teleselling with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, on the hunt for replacement parts to build a frequency counter, he looked up Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs landed a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
&quot;That was a huge influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my view of what a company was and how well they treated their employees.&quot;
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company&#39;s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw &quot;the first desktop computer ever made.&quot;
It was as big as a suitcase, had a little cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I would get a trip to HP as a teenager and mess around with that machine and write programs for it.
On improvising innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly.
Early in his career, as he was selling a handful of motherboards, he was asked by a customer if he could assemble all the equipment.
Working with only 30 days of credit, he had to figure out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
&quot;I remember having dramatic story lines...they yelled at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got fed up and went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and it was completely reliable.
On big companies losing steam:
Long before he led Apple&#39;s renaissance, Jobs presciently foresaw how many industry leaders would stumble on his vision, losing control of their market share.
&quot;Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers and printers, so what?&quot;
You have a monopoly on market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is these kinds of people who end up running the companies and the people in charge of the products are thrown out of the decision-making forum.
The product genius that led to that monopoly position is rotting away from people who don&#39;t have the notion of good products vs bad products - the necessary trade knowledge.
That&#39;s what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took defeat for victory.
On innovation as artistic expression:
&quot;There is a tremendous amount of work between a great idea and a great product...as the great idea evolves, it changes and grows.&quot;
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make - some things you can&#39;t make electrons do, glass does, robots do, factories do.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end it all comes down to taste - it boils down to trying to expose you to the best that a team of humans has done, and then trying to adapt those things to what you&#39;re doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We&#39;ve never been shy about stealing great ideas.
What made the Macintosh great in part was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who just happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren&#39;t for computing, I could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dine with healthcare law rivals as court accepts case
On the day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to consider the politically controversial question of whether to accept President Obama&#39;s challenge to his healthcare law, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were feted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will present the case before the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to carefully study the petitions for revision.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit brought by 26 states challenging comprehensive health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists across the country.
The justices have agreed to admit the lawsuit, and indeed a landmark 5 1/2 hour plea is expected in March, and the outcome will likely further cloud the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear in court and argue that the law should be struck down will likely be Paul Clement, who served as US attorney general during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement&#39;s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner for the Federalist Society, a group long dedicated to the defense of conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another backer was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court&#39;s preliminary hearing on the case.
Attendees included, among others, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of the health care bill.
The special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It&#39;s nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it&#39;s not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of lower federal magistrates.
If they were not, they would arguably fall under Canon Code 4C, which states: &quot;A judge may attend fundraisers for law-related organizations and others, though the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor , or appear in the program of such an event.&quot;
However, the sheer proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in the government.
&quot;This staggering ethics breach and disregard for the code goes against the demands of several justices that the court abide by the same rules that apply to all federal judges,&quot; said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause. Common).
&quot;The judges were feted at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending before the court.&quot;
Your appearance and assistance in raising funds for this event undermines any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that they too easily mix up court activity with the agenda pushed by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas&#39;s wife, Ginni, is a leading conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is Justice Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan served as attorney general in the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were filed in the trial court.
Her critics have pushed for Kagan to refrain from hearing the case, saying she was too involved in upholding the law to now be impartial.
Kagan has given no indication that he will.
Boeing Receives Record $18 Billion Order
Emirates Airlines orders 50 Boeing 777 double-aisle aircraft, with an option for 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, a deal valued at more than $1 billion.
It is rarely news when a company gets an order for 50 units of its product.
But it&#39;s a big transaction when the company is aircraft maker Boeing Co. and the sale price for all 50 planes is a record $18 billion.
It&#39;s as big as where Boeing got the order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 planes worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest-ever order for commercial airliners by dollar value - 50 Boing 777 twin-aisle jets.
The successful order came from Emirates Airlines in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes, which would bring the total sale price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Airshow.
Then on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts spectacular fuel economy and passenger services.
The sale price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
&quot;This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing,&quot; Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora said.
&quot;The quality of these particular customers is very strong.&quot;
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually bad for airlines, because it&#39;s one of the biggest costs - isn&#39;t so bad, because the country is making money from rising oil prices.
That&#39;s important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
&quot;They have a natural protection,&quot; he said.
The Emirates order solidifies Boeing&#39;s leadership in the wide-body jet market and helps ward off competitor Airbus SAS&#39;s attempt to encroach on its domain with the A350 airliner.
Boeing&#39;s win at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it was delaying the debut of the larger A350, which directly competes with the 777-300ER.
Delayed debut to add more boost after customers demanded increased payload and range.
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the Michoacán vote
Luisa María Calderón claims that drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the gubernatorial race.
The sister of President Felipe Calderón appears to have lost her bid for governor of Michoacán during elections in the violent state, and she claimed Monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents.
Preliminary results gave the lead in the western state gubernatorial race to Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
&quot;The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the entire country,&quot; Luisa María Calderón said in a radio interview a day after Sunday&#39;s vote.
&quot;They threatened our candidates, our poll workers... They seized the ballot boxes, set up barricades... and ordered people to vote&quot; for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a comeback, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI is hoping to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo appears to have narrowly edged out Calderón, who had led in the polls before the election.
Calderón, a candidate for his brother&#39;s conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the leftist candidate for the Partido Revolución Democrática, or PRD, who currently holds the post of governor, came in third, a major defeat for the divided and ill-fated left ahead of the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the Morelia state capital, denied links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is President Calderón&#39;s home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet the violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was assassinated a week before the elections while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates dropped out of local candidacies out of fear.
Although for the PRI, as unpleasant as the Michoacán elections may seem, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo, saying: &quot;I think this victory should be very encouraging, looking forward to next year.&quot;
AsDB urges Asia to help rescue eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would stunt the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, CEO of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world&#39;s two largest and fastest growing economies had to &quot;do everything possible&quot; to speed up the economic bloc&#39;s recovery, whether through the International Monetary Fund. or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries viewing Europe&#39;s difficulties in an &quot;impartial&quot; way and said financial assistance from Asia along with European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
&quot;We are all in this together.&quot;
&quot;So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful,&quot; he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
&quot;Asia can be protected to a certain extent, but she can&#39;t be immune.&quot;
&quot;So if China and India can help, let it be by all means.&quot;
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy&#39;s borrowing costs have spiked dangerously and the Italian and Greek prime ministers have resigned.
The ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channeled through the IMF, but said bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of EU bailout fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater bargaining power. for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, India&#39;s trade minister, said &quot;India is going to do everything it can&quot; to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from falling exports and drying up foreign capital inflows.
&quot;No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,&quot; he said.
&quot;We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s not an option, it&#39;s an imperative, because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women.&quot;
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help wealthy Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for India&#39;s 1.2 billion people, up to 800 million of whom live on around $2. a day or less.
&quot;At some point they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on holiday to the beaches and that will not go down well,&quot; he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India&#39;s reserves should be used to keep Greece&#39;s many well-paid public sector workers in jobs at poorly run, loss-making companies. like the railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatened &quot;major ripple effects&quot; across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank&#39;s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces &quot;downside risks&quot; from the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make &quot;contingency plans&quot; to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious warnings from the Pentagon about possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta heated up Congress Monday, warning that looming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and spark a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already digesting the $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on the spent.
&quot;The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department,&quot; Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Ariz., and Senator Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said the failure of Congress to agree on the budget and its consequence, the so-called &quot;hijacking,&quot; would result in 23 percent overall cuts and a halt to many new projects.
&quot;Such a cut, applied in this indiscriminate manner, would make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects unworkable - you can&#39;t buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts. &quot;, wrote Panetta to the senators.
&quot;We would also be forced to lay off many of our civilian staff involuntarily, and because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would almost certainly have to furlough civilians in order to meet the goal.&quot;
&quot;These changes would break faith with those who maintain our military and seriously damage goodwill.&quot;
The cuts would eventually reach combat troops, Panetta said.
&quot;While wartime funding in the Overseas Contingency Operations accounts is not directly affected by the sequestration, war efforts would be negatively impacted by severe disruptions to core budgets,&quot; Panetta warned.
&quot;Hiring would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and oversight of the war-supporting contract.&quot;
&quot;Staff on the payroll would be cut, leading to late payments to wartime providers, and legal and political support would be cut off.&quot;
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
&quot;The fallout from a Defense Department hijacking would lead to a rapid decline of the United States as the world&#39;s leading military power.&quot;
&quot;We are firmly against this draconian action,&quot; the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when Panetta&#39;s letter was released.
&quot;This is not an outcome that can be lived with, and certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves.&quot;
&quot;Kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it must not be allowed to happen.&quot;
Whether Panetta&#39;s letter and recent warnings from senators will increase pressure for a budget compromise or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about possible cuts, even though he came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budget experience in Congress and the White House and knowing he was faced with tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense secretary painted a bleak picture of what could lie ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core.
&quot;It is a ship without sailors.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a brigade without bullets.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s an air wing without enough trained pilots.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to accomplish the mission,&quot; Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
&quot;It is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with potential adversaries.&quot;
&quot;Indeed, it invites aggression...&quot;
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta lays out new details of how the reductions &quot;create significant operational risks: delayed response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be pre-deployed and engaged in everyone; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations.&quot;
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those already being tested and some only in the early planning stages.
That list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter jet, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new littoral combat ship, and the new ground combat vehicle the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Halting further development and testing of the F35 could yield some $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but supporters say it&#39;s the vital next step to improve and deal with potential threats from China and other rivals.
how to spot a lie
A glance at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and pervasive deceit and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy trading sexual harassment allegations with several women; each party accuses the other of lying.
Administrators at Pennsylvania State University have been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was &quot;caught&quot; on an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist, Anthony Weiner, made a fool of himself with his denials that were quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations related to covering up an extramarital affair.
And again, no one who lived through it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about cheating in school and university exams are widespread.
There have been cases in which teachers have given exam answers to students in order to be better seen in their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How deceitful are we?
On any given day, studies show that you can be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That&#39;s for sure, many of those lies are white lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Detecting lies, or &quot;lie spotting,&quot; is an essential skill that must be acquired by all of us, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, say, Charade, where the goal is to exclaim, &quot;I&#39;ve got you&quot;, deception detection is a serious body of knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the last six decades at prestigious universities that they conducted in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about lying have been disproved.
Liars do look into the eyes.
They don&#39;t always stutter, lisp, blush, or fidget.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can arrive at the truth by learning about statement structure, microfacial expressions, question formation, and tenses.
I spent several years plumbing the scientific findings on deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that deception detection is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world - especially if your responsibilities Professionals include hiring, interviewing, or managing negotiations.
Good liars have the ability to read others well, putting them at ease, managing their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more &quot;self-oriented lies&quot; while women tell more &quot;other-oriented&quot; lies -- usually to protect someone&#39;s feelings -- that married people lie less frequently to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they often tell tend to be &quot;huge&quot;).
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the habitual behavior of the subject.
This is called &quot;creating a baseline.&quot;
It helps provide benchmarks for later measurement of changes.
Note the subject&#39;s posture, laugh, and vocal characteristic.
You better know if someone normally taps their feet all the time so you don&#39;t make unfair accusations when you see their feet tapping in the middle of the meeting.
Next, look for groups of deceptive behavior, verbal and non-verbal.
Consider these clusters of behavior as red flags, not evidence of deception.
People who cheat may freeze their upper body trying to recall their story, point their feet toward the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or exhibit &quot;post-interview vent&quot; -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all the hard questions are over.
Interrogators often falsely pretend that the interview is over just to seek post-interview relief.
Also pay attention to the vocabulary of the subject.
Scott Peterson botched it all the way and used the past tense while claiming his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide manhunt for her.
People who cheat may also use distancing language: &quot;I did not have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky&quot; or repeat a difficult question in full.
The most common verbal cues are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of &quot;restrictive language&quot; when answering a difficult question: &quot;Well...to tell you the truth...as far as I know...to the best of my knowledge.&quot;
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to detect deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone&#39;s chances of avoiding being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial pipeline plan diverted after threat of US delay in approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering unions while appeasing environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to get it back on track.
TransCanada said late Monday that it will move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska, and is confident the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada executive Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different route.
This follows the announcement last week by the State Department that it would delay a decision on a federal permit for the project until potential new routes are studied that bypass the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply of underground water.
&quot;This is a real avenue of progress,&quot; Rep. Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to set aside any decision until 2013, after next year&#39;s elections, although officials denied that politics was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department&#39;s request, and expressed his full support for them.
The 1,700 kilometer pipeline would stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would carry 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it would be necessary for him to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by labor groups, which have bet on an estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are considering legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the country&#39;s largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department&#39;s current environmental impact study found the project posed only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department&#39;s inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether TransCanada&#39;s hired lobbyist Paul Elliot, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to run the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit in fear
A New York family claims disco diva Patti LaBelle behaved like a madwoman in the lobby of their Manhattan building, terrifying their young daughter to the point that she vomited in fear.
The &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; singer&#39;s tirade scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered &quot;personality changes, sleep disturbances&quot; and &quot;increased fear of strangers,&quot; her family says in Supreme Court of manhattan.
It was November 10 of last year when stagehand Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten teacher Roseanna, and Genevieve were getting ready to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk got in the car, Roseanna Monk came down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building with her luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stood near the door and put her daughter down for a moment.
&quot;Someone came up behind me and said, &#39;Do you know what your daughter is doing?&#39; I said &#39;yes&#39; and went to get it,&#39; he said.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
He said in an aggressive tone, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t have left your daughter near the door,&quot; Roseanna Monk said.
&quot;I told him, &#39;I have no interest in what you say or think.&#39;
He became enraged and started using bad words - the C word and the J word out loud...
He had a bottle of water and he started throwing the water from the bottle on me.&quot;
He said Genevieve was hysterical.
&quot;I told this woman, &#39;Look what you&#39;ve done to my daughter,&#39; said the girl&#39;s mother.
LaBelle lunged at the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be restrained by her surroundings and led away to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so hard she vomited, he added.
The family later sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but got no response.
LaBelle&#39;s attorney and representatives did not return calls for comment.
The suit seeks unspecified damages, but the family&#39;s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and the family plans to donate any money they raise to a charity for children with cancer.
&quot;The purpose is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct,&quot; Davis said.
&quot;That kind of conduct is completely unacceptable, especially when directed at a kindergarten teacher holding an 18-month-old child.&quot;
Weather adversity slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez&#39;s administration, unemployment and informality have increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment has decreased and the economy has contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-proclaimed change, which generated great expectations regarding the advances in the economy, but given the initial climatic adversity of the year, no growth is observed, instead there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures in February, in addition to causing million-dollar losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic drop of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report on the effects of frost, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damages to 582,835 cultivated hectares, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent had partial damage. , the main damaged crops were vegetables, corn and chickpeas.
The drop in economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year accelerated growth was observed, since while From January to March, 55,053 Sinaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Economically Active Population. For the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 percent. , a rate that in number of people shows more than 74,000 unemployed Sinaloans, an increase compared to the first semester of 18,969 individuals.
lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on the actions that public policy takes have done.
&quot;What is being seen is a growth in unemployment that has to do with various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources due to the legislation that was approved in Congress to combat money laundering. It is not easy for people who illegally grab dollars to work on them, invest them and use them for something,&quot; he said.
stopped migration
López Cervantes pointed out that in the increase in unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
&quot;The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, firstly because of the difficulties to enter, and secondly because entering they already have many difficulties to find work, these people are staying and is demanding jobs here in the state, which causes unemployment to rise,&quot; he said.
Informality
The analysis of the Sinaloan labor market is aggravated when considering the high level of informality that prevails among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population in the state works without contributing as a worker to any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state&#39;s labor lags is low wages, the entity has the lowest remunerations in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7,375 pesos.
FDI contraction
Coupled with the drop in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 the largest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years was recorded, according to the Ministry of Economy from January to June of state FDI totaled 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a fall of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars registered during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Secretary of Economic Development of the State Government records a total investment of 17 thousand 280 million pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the state government requested in July from the state congress the approval of a loan for 3 billion pesos, which would be used for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to reactivate the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2 thousand 600 million pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the state economy.
reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the state government itself.
&quot;The performance of the economy in Sinaloa this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, we needed to align everyone&#39;s efforts and above all the good already synchronized march of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better,&quot; he said.
economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events such as the frosts at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
&quot;The low economic flow is the product of various events, including frost, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn around fast enough to generate economic dynamism that allows for an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations we had&quot;, he mentioned.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers&#39; Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, stated that it is necessary to direct the state towards more dynamic productive activities.
&quot;In general terms, we have observed that work has been going on, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material resource is detonated and human that Sinaloa has,&quot; he said.
work to do
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that better guides the efforts of the Government.
&quot;In general terms, I would say that the government has been making an effort to give good results in different areas. In terms of economic development, there have been some advances, but it is important that a long-term program be developed,&quot; he said.
He pointed out that the current administration has shown progress in its way of conducting public policy.
&quot;There are elements that allow us to say that the government is being more inclusive, what I can say is that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to be done,&quot; he said.
They sentence him for 8 kgs of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a 100-day fine for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic reported that the sentenced drug dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime of against health, in its variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.

You owe contributions for works
The works of a social nature contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or of having serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of municipal Social Development indicated that although the work programs have advanced so far, they are at risk since the State Government has not complied with the contributions that correspond to it, which add up to a resource of more than 11 million pesos. in all three programs.
He pointed out that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent corresponds to the State and that up to now only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so the possible delay in the conclusion of these becomes effective.
&quot;There are almost 12 million that they have to contribute and despite the fact that the year is about to end they have not given us a fifth, when since July they should have given us a part,&quot; he said, &quot;so as not to delay we have started the works and they are going very advanced, but we need the money.
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to request a loan to cover the more than 7 million that it did not contribute. at that time the state administration.
&quot;It already happened to us in the previous six-year term because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to work, and this year in order to access these programs we had to obtain the resources to cover what the State left pending,&quot; he explained. .
Despite the fact that there is a commitment from the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to expedite the efforts so that the percentages that correspond to them arrive as soon as possible. possible.
&quot;There are almost 12 million that they have to contribute and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they have not given us a fifth.&quot;
Cut validates &quot;analog blackout&quot; in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that the world has undergone in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies filed by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that advances the so-called &quot;analog blackout&quot; from 2021 to 2015, since the eight votes necessary for it were not met. invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when issuing the decree detailing the actions to follow to complete the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft ruling, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, since the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero herself voted in favor of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree, and upon admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions established in it for the digital transition.
The plenary session of ministers also resolved to dismiss the demand filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the minister president said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal Executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to prepare.
&quot;Neither do I believe that doing so would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body,&quot; and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the federal Executive, who has a constitutional mandate, the rectory of the State.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital ones is one of the most important changes that the world has undergone in recent years, and it translates into better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing the change, he argued, would be postponing the benefits of digitization, which implies a decision in the public interest, which does not only have a technical dimension, &quot;since it encompasses economic, social, political and national security issues.&quot;
These issues, he stressed, &quot;require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic stewardship of the State, encompassing a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive.&quot;
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and have done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive Branch, by issuing the contested decree, is invading in some way the sphere of competence of Congress, since the observance of the laws issued by the Legislature is being provided in the administrative sphere, he assured.
They analyze the possibility of a &quot;vote by vote&quot; count in Michoacán
According to the data provided by the PREP, the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial election is barely 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,074 total tally sheets.
The possibility of counting &quot;vote by vote&quot; is a reality in what refers to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data provided by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second place of the gubernatorial election is barely 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,074 total tally sheets.
In this regard, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just last November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local norms with the federal reform in electoral matters.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Law, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal term for them to enter into force in the present process. electoral campaign and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the deadlines established in the Official State Newspaper Law, arguing that he had some objections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and described as &quot;invalid and illegal&quot; the vote of the state president to the constitutional reforms, since it does not have right to &quot;sanction or veto&quot; them.
Interviewed about the possibility of &quot;vote by vote&quot;, María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM, it will be possible to carry out partial and total recounts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial recount of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may occur in the event that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; There is no scrutiny and counting record in the polling station file or it is not in the possession of the president of the polling station; or, when there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total recount of the votes received in all the voting booths may be carried out when there is an indication that the difference between the presumed winner of the election in question and the one who has obtained second place in the voting is equal to or less than one percentage point; as long as at the beginning of the session there is the express request of the representative of the party and/or coalition that nominated the second of the indicated candidates.
The total recount of the vote may also be carried out if, at the end of the ordinary count, it is established that the difference between the presumably winning candidate and the one located in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, as long as there is the express request of the representative of the political party whose candidate came in second place, in which case the electoral packages that have been partially recounted will be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the Morelia election is in this situation, where according to the PREP the difference between first and second place is barely 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total tallies.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country on the brink of economic disaster.
Italian Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet Italy&#39;s president on Wednesday to present the new government that will deal with a crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic disaster and jeopardized the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to produce a cabinet made up mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he will present to the president the result of his talks with the political parties in his bid to form a government.
&quot;I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country&#39;s ability to overcome this difficult phase,&quot; the former European commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not say explicitly that he will be able to form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The &quot;framework is now well outlined,&quot; he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, as Italy battles a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a harsh austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore battered confidence in Italy.
Underscoring the pressure on Monti to hurry, unsteady markets pushed the yield on Italy&#39;s 10-year BTP bonds above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be bailed out.
Emma Marcegaglia, the leader of the Italian employers&#39; association Confindustria, told reporters after meeting Monti: &quot;We said we would be very supportive of this government.&quot;
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti&#39;s chances of success were boosted considerably by the PDL party backing of Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced by the crisis to resign on Saturday.
&quot;We believe that Professor Monti&#39;s efforts are destined to have a good result,&quot; Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy&#39;s largest party, is significant because until now many of its members have opposed the mostly technocratic government that Monti is forming.
parliamentary support
Monti&#39;s new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in their efforts could spark a devastating new attack from the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure, warning that a failure by Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations on Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as youth and women&#39;s organizations.
He will end his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite late last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would step down, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty over whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Bailing out Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the eurozone&#39;s current financial defenses.
Monti has said his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before early elections.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist it should consist only of technicians, an indication of their qualms about a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The friction of the Spanish is superior to that of the Ticos
Of the 22 soccer players called from Spain, ten have exceeded 50 international games.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 called up reached 50 games.
A major contrast to that of Costa Rica, if we compare the 22 summoned by both countries for today&#39;s friendly, at 3:05 pm, at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and European champions, number one in the FIFA monthly ranking, have an extensive record of class A inter-selection games, the Tricolor only has defender Michael Umaña as the only one to have 50 international matches.
Said figure was reached the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), at the Rommel Fernández.
Spanish soccer players who play in the All-Star League and in powerful English Premier League clubs, maintain intense activity every year in league and domestic cup championships, and high-level clashes in European cups such as the Champions League.
To this is added the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated qualifying rounds for the Euro Cup and the World Cup.
Costa Rican soccer players, on the other hand, have limited international contact in an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish National Team is that of goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who the previous Saturday against England (0-1 loss in London) equaled the record of exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and they will set a new record for Spain of 127 caps.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona&#39;s cerebral midfielder, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA along with the other centenarians of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke striker, Raúl González, with 102.
Almost close to the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
They are followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fabregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the Tico side, and close to Michael Umaña, are the left back Júnior Díaz, with 48 appearances and the gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five exceeded 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 appearances in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest do not come close to 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have yet to debut.
Spain&#39;s historic goalscorer is David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one with the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country in its tour to celebrate two decades of experience
&quot;Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true&quot;
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said that the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday, at the National Stadium.
It has been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band assures that for them it will also be to make the dream of playing in the country a reality.
This was stated by the bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is in the South American wing of its tour to celebrate two decades of work and on Sunday the 20th it will make its only stop in Central America.
That day they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 pm, together with the Los Angeles band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which is in La Nación on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican fans, it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is only our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I have been to Costa Rica only once and on vacation; It is such a beautiful country and I think we will be able to stay a few days there.
So we&#39;re excited to get our music out there.
I ask because there is a kind of devotion towards the band, the fans live with intensity the previous days.
What do they say to their most fervent supporters?
Thank you for staying by our side through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; Thank you for waiting so long and we&#39;re sorry it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we&#39;ve played in the last 21 years have happened in the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and hopefully that got us in shape for this show in Costa Rica.
We&#39;re really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are incredible.
My friends always went surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that&#39;s how we found out about it, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they have been delivering huge shows with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we&#39;ve never played there before, so we don&#39;t have any restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is this about?
I think it&#39;s partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it&#39;s hard to choose which songs to play each night.
When we have two or three songs in our set list that we haven&#39;t played in a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs that we may have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of experience.
Looking back, is it hard to believe how much you have accomplished?
Yes absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us imagined we&#39;d be in a big rock band and having done it for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love to create music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world that we always wanted to go.
Things couldn&#39;t be better for us.
What did it mean to you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of grunge?
It&#39;s always been an honor to be a part of that group of great bands.
We are very close to the people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It&#39;s amazing when a movement comes from a group of friends and it&#39;s something rare.
Every once in a while, a band comes out of a city, but it&#39;s much rarer when five or ten bands come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be a part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour, so we&#39;re lucky to still be friends with all of them and honored to be a part of that Seattle sound that came out of it.
It&#39;s also very strange that a band like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yeah, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which on its own is much longer than many bands last.
First, I think we&#39;re all lucky to still be alive, and second, we all care about each other.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also opened up that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other with each other&#39;s music and it couldn&#39;t be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been easy; however, thanks to their success, they have been able to do whatever they want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure that we don&#39;t tour too much because it&#39;s easy to fall for that game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for the music, that reminds you to respect the music and what brought it, without being infatuated with being famous and being a rock star, which none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote really good songs and at first it was kind of great.
We were a band for almost three years and we never put out a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration that it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still very good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think of what an amazing person Andy is. it was and how it made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and soccer and much more.
He was an amazing human being and we miss him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that&#39;s why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with various proposals and that was the band that we liked the most, so we are looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics for Yellow Ledbetter live?
That&#39;s a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don&#39;t know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that comes to mind.
As a bassist, what are your influences?
There are so many.
Among the first that come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, CJ Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep grunge relevant despite not being a fad anymore?
I think all of us always feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the bands that came out at the same time, and if there&#39;s relevance now, I think it&#39;s a wonderful thing because it&#39;s music worth listening to and bands worth listening to. like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
Why the change?
It&#39;s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that maybe seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs even though they might sound a bit positive.
With both, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there&#39;s some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs definitely represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is admitted again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his family doctor reported.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from various ailments, including tongue cancer for which he has undergone surgery four times and that is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told Canal N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said that he does not want it because he knows he is innocent.
He underwent surgery four times for cancer of the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilos to which other pathologies have been added such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, arterial hypertension and problems circulatory system in the legs, listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people at the hands of an army assassination squad that operated clandestinely in the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and made up of various ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political and commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans residing in Mexico, according to the agenda released by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be &quot;propitious for the exchange of information in all political affairs between the two nations,&quot; according to what the Presidency of the South American country published on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country in a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call to consult its ambassador in the European country.
Since November, Mexico has chaired the G20, a group made up of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world, and has had an agreement in force with the South American country since January of this year to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to expedite the completion of tax exchange agreements in order to get off the &quot;grey list&quot; of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), made up of countries that have not implemented all the international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
On the commercial front, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustachioed plumber goes all three dimensions with &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot;
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never before has he done so in three dimensions: in &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; he will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopic technology
Hitting stores around the world this month, the title has been designed from the ground up to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS handheld system, which allows for glasses-free 3D gaming.
&quot;Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses,&quot; said Nintendo&#39;s specialized press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is &quot;Nintendo&#39;s first video game originally designed for that support&quot;, since until now hits like &quot;Star Fox 64 3D&quot; or &quot;Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D&quot; were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman has maintained that, despite being in 3D, &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is an &quot;accessible&quot; video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Álvarez has affirmed that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; contains two games in one: the first part is &quot;simple&quot; to hook less skilled users.
Once passed, the most expert will be able to give a &quot;second turn&quot; to the game levels, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an &quot;aggressive D&quot; or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and &quot;not succumb to optical illusions&quot;.
This incursion of Super Mario into three dimensions also means the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo winks at fans of the saga and repeats the formula for the success of previous installments, consisting of the plumber with the mustache having to go through platforms full of dangers in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a &quot;playable&quot; Luigi.
Colom endorses Portillo&#39;s extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he has processed the extradition of ex-governor Alfonso Portillo so that he can answer in the United States for the conspiracy to launder US$70 million.
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to try him there.
In a press conference, Colom affirmed that his decision obeys the independence of the judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a sentencing court had already ordered the extradition.
He asserted that during his tenure he &quot;did not get his hands on&quot; judicial resolutions and processed all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited, for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom did is an executive process after all judicial and constitutional instances have been exhausted to prosecute the former president between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for the embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process that preceded the extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the fall into the marginality of boys without training
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter of a century.
To this is added the hundred or so jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to take stock in an act held in the old Fabra i Coats factory complex which was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella neighborhood in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with drug addiction problems or in a situation of falling into marginality.
Yesterday&#39;s celebration in Sant Andreu brought together a large number of heads of entities and institutions that have collaborated with the association in these 25 years.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former Socialist Education Minister, Ernest Maragall, and the former Mayor and current ecosocialist councilor Ricard Gomà attended the event.
Also present in the great hall of Fabra i Coats were the current Minister for Social and Family Welfare, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of La Caixa&#39;s social work, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas affirmed that Trinijove was born in very difficult times and that the current one is also difficult, but added that the work carried out up to now &quot;is a good base&quot;.
The president gave Trinijove an example for knowing how to fight against bad circumstances and for giving hope to people in difficulties.
&quot;The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,&quot; he said.
Evicted a squatted farm where macro parties were held
The invaders had taken over 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm at noon yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare lived by the residents of 51 Calle de Balmes has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the property they were illegally occupying yesterday at noon, and where they organized macro-parties that made the neighborhood desperate, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was finished, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
&quot;From now on there will be access control,&quot; said the administrator.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building -the rest are inhabited-, took the entire electrical installation and part of the water installation, as well as painting the walls and leaving all kinds of waste, especially drink cans. alcoholic.
The first three floors were the scene of massive parties, which lasted up to two days and made the tenants desperate.
Next to the building there is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that since the building was occupied, business has dropped by 80%.
The owner of the nightclub points out that the invaders of the farm made unfair competition, since they sold the drinks for three euros, while in the nightclub they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment venue had had to respond to neighborhood complaints about noise, while, as she pointed out, the disturbances are not caused by the clients of the nightclub, but by the inhabitants of the squatted house and, above all, those who attend the parties that were organized there, which had increased in frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to angry residents of the area.
The person in charge of the nightclub explained that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and for nine months she &quot;forgives&quot; the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that in recent weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had demanded last week &quot;to immediately vacate the property to end the problems of coexistence and civility that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area&quot; .
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the last few months the squatters had been entering all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that there have even been robberies.
In this sense, he added that &quot;it is necessary to put an end to impunity and be forceful against the incivility that has been generated on the farm.&quot;
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., the police went to 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed that four people were entering the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversy over fees
The municipal competition for the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now extinct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration printed some promotional flyers for Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What&#39;s more, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with New York&#39;s Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park returned to its position, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital one of the few that is not oriented on the north-south axis but rather up (mountain ) -down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park redounds to this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the wild boars in the role of Yogi Bear.
In these they were until, in September, the city council called a mega-competition made up of 16 competitions for as many access doors to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of a park, without a doubt.
Either that or someone intends to put doors to the field.
The question comes out on its own: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it means to reflect on the city, is the topic of conversation among all Barcelonan architects.
It is almost a recurring theme to use when two members of this ancient caste of chosen ones recognize each other in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelonan architects think, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front &quot;it becomes necessary&quot; to discuss &quot;the mountain front&quot;, since Ildefons Cerdà&#39;s speech, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
&quot;It should be assumed that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things because of its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex&quot;, says the architect, for whom the title of &quot;Collserola gates&quot; contains a &quot;lexical trap&quot;: you should not think of them &quot;as the accesses to a park, but rather the delimitation of areas where you have to act &quot;.
Mòdol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as an &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; with &quot;some dangers&quot;.
Dangers derived from how &quot;uncertain it is today to project public space&quot; after the experience lived in the 80s and that had &quot;its swan song&quot; in the Forum area.
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on where you can build.
&quot;Limiting something is already fixing the next step&quot;, that is, its surpassing.
&quot;You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can lead to real disasters.&quot;
Closer to the question, Mòdol believes that, simplifying, the Collserola side of Valles &quot;can be understood as a park, the Barcelona side, not&quot;, for a purely topographical issue.
Mòdol recalls that there is already work done by the Patronat de Collserola that &quot;should not fall on deaf ears&quot;, although he appreciates the opportunity that the council offers his union to intervene in this project &quot;from the very beginning&quot;.
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe-conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but he &quot;doubts&quot; about whether it is this technical profile that should lead the multidisciplinary teams (&quot;a complete success&quot; , he points out) that have had to be created: &quot;Architects should only be a tool&quot;.
Bayona hints that the answer to the question that gives this piece its title is complex, because the contest rules lack a global vision of Collserola: &quot;16 transversal contests have been called -he says- in the mountain-sea direction, but there is no a longitudinal reading, that sees and understands the area as a whole&quot;.
This causes, at least in his case, that he has chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors may clash in program and definition with that of the architect for the next door.
In his opinion, yes, the city council should guarantee that the strip immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide, in its entirety, an area of facilities that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino pardons Jonás Larrazábal and he will go free
After 72 days of detention, the legal representative of Casino Red pardoned the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the process that was followed for alleged blackmail
After spending 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal representative of Casino Red granted him a pardon before the Second Criminal District Court, which is pursuing a process for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded the payment of an economic fee so that the Monterrey city council would allow the clandestine operation of the betting house.
Following the public complaint, the state Attorney General&#39;s Office opened criminal proceedings against the brother of the PAN mayor and on September 2 he was detained and detained for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agent of the Public Ministry 3 in Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to Casa de Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained in that place for the 49 days following the issuance of a second arrest warrant after the Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office dismissed the crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta prison, allegedly for blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos; however, he only stayed a few hours in the medium-security prison since there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, an arrest warrant was issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigations, sufficient evidence was verified to determine Jonás&#39; guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million of pesos to the representatives of the betting house in exchange for allowing the operation of the same.
This Monday, the legal representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went before the judge José Luis Pecina to request a pardon for the brother of the royal mayor; so in the next few hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal proceeding, the Public Ministry agent attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and who of the bookmaker&#39;s partners was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
Based on file 197/2011, the legal pardon is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and from now on no claim may be filed regarding the process that was followed; in addition to not being required to repair damage or punishment.
After the hearing with the legal representative of the betting house, at about 3:50 p.m. the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The secretary of the Court, Jorge Yánez, went to the San Nicolás de los Garza municipal jail to notify Jonás that he has been legally pardoned and his file will be archived.
It will also notify you of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash where the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven other people lost their lives
The Ministry of Communications and Transportation (SCT) reported that the results of the accident where the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter directly impacted the ground in complete integrity. structural, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transportation, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot verified that the weather conditions were adequate for flying.
&quot;The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage.&quot;
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport the personnel.
In addition, he said that in the investigations carried out in the impact zone, the appearance of pieces on the ground is not reported.
&quot;In a search, it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship in another place, the impact was structural.
&quot;The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to transport the passengers.
The land presents a slope of seven degrees at 30 degrees of inclination.
For now, the secretary assured that it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible; however, the investigation can last several months, it could even last a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, general director of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff was operating at cruising speed and that this happened on soft ascending ground.
&quot;This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the moment of impact,&quot; he said.
At the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
visual flight:
In accordance with aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out under visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the terrain.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM located adequate conditions for takeoff, as the aircraft advanced towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico, there were layers of cloudiness at low altitude.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the cloudy conditions, the crew sought an area of lower elevation and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact location.
The impact coordinates and the last radar record of the aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersal of aircraft debris in a small area:
The information available up to now allows us to assume that the impact occurred in a straight and sideways trajectory.
The pattern of dispersion of aircraft debris allows us to assume that the helicopter impacted the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion detected:
At the site of the accident, no evidence of any type of explosion or fire has been revealed in the remains of the ship.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the terrain.
During field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above mean sea level, the terrain presents a slope that goes from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predictably dismantled along said journey.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After a meticulous search in an area larger than the cordoned off site, around the accident, no scattered pieces of the aircraft have been found, which strengthens the presumption that the impact occurred in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity gene
Social Security directs an investigation to discover the obesity gene in children and young people; is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people, called the &#39;Genetics of childhood and adolescent obesity&#39; protocol, which will make it possible to have markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, the population is invited to participate, whether or not they have rights, to go to the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out on minors, every Saturday from 8:00 a.m. hours.
He stressed that the protocol began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Western Mexico State) and that since October 8, the activity has been carried out at the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Eastern Mexico State).
Once the objective of gathering 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independencia Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (in the north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and youth to prevent the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day is celebrated this November 14, he specified that the objective is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on nutrition .
They will also be asked about physical activity and hereditary family history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturdays anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure measurement, determination of glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol and insulin and genetic levels (seeking to identify genes that are associated with to childhood obesity).
Cruz López pointed out that this investigation is due to the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
&#39;The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity, and of girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight, a dramatic rise was also observed,&#39; highlighted the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country&#39;s population differs from others due to its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 percent American Indian, 30 percent European, and 5 percent African heritage, and this condition is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive evaluation of the children, which makes it possible to detect whether they are overweight or obese.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm, which indicate the probability that he suffers from metabolic disorders and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, the doctors deliver it in writing to the parents, who are explained each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity, and other chronic conditions: a sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day sitting in front of the television, and using means of transportation instead of walking long distances. short.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, that is, the greater consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with a high fat and protein content, and the genetics that are analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid potholes
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at UNAM&#39;s Faculty of Chemistry, develops polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mix with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals sent by the pavement were heeded, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 potholes each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at UNAM&#39;s Faculty of Chemistry (FQ). who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is adequate, the potholes could be reduced in number or even completely eliminated.
In his conference A technological opinion on potholes, delivered within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he revealed that the laboratory he is in charge of develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with a greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of petroleum, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some with high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others with low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists of the fact that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but rather it changes during the day according to the environmental and temperature conditions, warned the specialist in chemical engineering.
The CF researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which is made up of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt layer, made up of small stones dipped in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the little stones that make up the folder, he pointed out, is coated with asphalt.
When passing vehicles and generating efforts, it allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt, it would spread even better, said the chemical engineer.
On top of the asphalt layer, he added, a last layer called the rolling layer is placed, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As it is the layer that will be in contact with the tires of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide friction on the road.
As it is the part of the pavement that is going to receive and spread the stresses, the surface layer also needs to have the appropriate thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken care of.
The weather, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it considerably affects the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the ground becomes wet, the water diffuses inside the mat and it is difficult for it to come out, this causes a softening of all the layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
In the process of formation of a pothole, he said, the first to wear is the film of bearing and only later is the asphalt layer affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, rather it is a process that should be addressed at the first signs with adequate maintenance programs.
The also member of the National System of Investigators explained that the vehicular load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each of the pavement layers must always be in relation to the vehicular load and guarantee that comply, to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries and allow potholes to be repaired easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the candidate from Valle lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that led to Melina Ramírez Serna not reaching the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley receives its 14th princess title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca is left with the desire for the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the winners&#39; podium, wearing the silver crown and the sash that accredit her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico won the crown and scepter, the department already has 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins the legion of Valle del Cauca women who have been close to the crown but who were proclaimed princesses including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many ask themselves is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was she chosen Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that queens like Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision made by the jury to designate her First Princess is that she was not convinced with her answer to the question &quot;What is that book that has marked you and why?&quot; asked by Martín Murillo Gómez , from the Leamos Literary Cart.
When questioned, the Valle del Cauca responded:
&quot;I read a lot, I believe in literature a lot, I think it&#39;s a way of becoming cultural, I definitely believe that the book that marked me as a child is &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, it&#39;s a pretty deep book.
I am currently reading &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, it is a universal literature book that we should all read; and today I am reading the book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called &quot;The Burning of the Blood&quot;&quot;.
A response that was disliked firstly because of the term &quot;culturalization&quot; and secondly because it did not explain in a concrete way how each of the books she cited has marked her.
But at the end of the ceremony, Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result &quot;the universe is wise, whatever has to happen happens.
And for all the people, please read a little bit, &quot;The Little Prince&quot; is a great book.&quot;
Among the hypotheses put forward, it is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A Bogotá journalist insinuated that being the favorite, the applause and the candidate who won all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best handmade costume, and Queen Mother), &quot;that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that&#39;s why she didn&#39;t shine on stage&quot;.
And that was evident in her first bathing suit appearance on the beach at the Hilton and her two coronation evening shows.
Although she looked confident in both, it was noted that she lacked the strength and impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico did demonstrate.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the &quot;Como en casa&quot; program on Canal RCN, opined that the fact that Melina was designated princess &quot;proves that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest is not left as queen.&quot;
In addition, Valle was very elusive to the last with the press, and there she was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
For something, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
&quot;Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensitivity, that before entering the Contest you are already involved in projects,&quot; he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned because of her defects in the derriere and the fibrosis that was noticeable in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because the jury chose her as the &quot;Natural Beauty&quot; candidate with the healthiest body, good nutrition and physical work responsible.
The queen trainer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, &quot;but her fibrosis problem in the abdomen, which was not really noticeable to me, lowered her points on the last day.&quot;
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos, from Cromos magazine, considers that the mistake made by La Valle del Cauca was the surgical interventions that were performed.
&quot;The surgeries are fine, but Valle did not know how to do them.
His body was never his forte and here they charged him &quot;.
For this award, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in a bathing suit a cruel prediction arose that last night came true, since it was said that this was the contentment that Raymundo gave Melina so as not to give her the taste of the crown
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins a year of reign from today, not as sovereign, but as princess, a position that gives her the possibility of representing Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Contest itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, was eluded by the crown.
This was the work of the man from Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lofoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;.
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a lofoscopist from the CTI of Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the top chief of the Farc: &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;, through the comparison of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lofoscopists who work in the CTI section, that week it was the turn of &quot;availability&quot; for Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the judicial investigation area for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities in Chocó, where he often had to go into the jungle for more than five days to reach the place where the corpses that had to be identified were located.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after completing the corresponding courses, he specialized in lofoscopia, which is the study of friction skin, that is, the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against aliases Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to wear at least three days&#39; clothing.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to bring the tenprint card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the place where the body was found, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, as it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local farmer, without glasses, and much thinner.
But the prints don&#39;t lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter, and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints on the corpse with those on the card.
His eye did not fail him: it was &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;.
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was indeed the top commander of the Farc.
In search of the trace
For a dactiloscopist from the Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, at the press conference for the operation against &quot;Cano&quot;, is very significant.
Many people do not know our work.
Fingerprinting is an exact science, with no margin for error, which can become key in solving crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, the lofoscopistas support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the people captured.
When caught, many criminals present false IDs or do not have papers.
We take their fingerprints and look them up in the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of the wall from a house, since the thief had placed his hand in that place to remove a safe full of jewelry and money.
&quot;The walls are difficult because they are not appropriate surfaces to take a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to obtain the print of the entire hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts,&quot; he recalled.
Fingerprints can also rule out or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
They recently found a dead man, with liquor bottles around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a relative could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a print on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that it was the murderer, it does place him at the scene of the crime.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that on the objects &quot;the prints are taken with chemical or physical reagents.&quot;
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
&quot;The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,&quot; said the CTI expert.
He clarified that not everything is as shown on the CSI television show.
Just as not everything that glitters is gold, not everything that is touched becomes a footprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective comparison is made.
The &quot;outraged&quot; challenge authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part complied with the eviction order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement defied the New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter, under the protection of a court order, the Manhattan square from where they were evicted at dawn and by trying to occupy another park in the big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters crowded in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access thanks to a court order that allows the &quot;outraged&quot; to return to camp in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city , where there have been new arrests.
&quot;Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square again, we are going to settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,&quot; said one. of the spokesmen of the &quot;Occupy Wall Street&quot; movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the &quot;outraged&quot; to the eviction of their camp personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed protesters to stay camped.
In addition, the &quot;outraged&quot; proceeded to occupy a new park located at the confluence of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by the parish. from Trinity Church.
They managed to occupy the place for at least an hour, but later the Police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the specific number, while he assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization assures that there are several hundred people who had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved in a show of support for the members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the Police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned venue - remains closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation this morning must be analyzed.
Some of the protesters displaced there carried and distributed copies of that court order at this time and even handed them over to the agents guarding the square, which caused &quot;some small clashes,&quot; said Bray, who denounced that some officers beat up protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting Occupy Wall Street members or enforcing &quot;laws that were issued after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with shops or other property they previously used.&quot;
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, due to that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, warning them, however, that local laws do not allow them to re-install with stores tent and sleeping bags.
The councilor personally defended the eviction carried out at dawn from Zuccotti Square, an operation in which around 200 arrests were made and which was decided because the protesters were &quot;violating the law&quot;.
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming &quot;a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people,&quot; since &quot;some businesses had received threats&quot; and the neighbors feared &quot;for their quality of life.&quot;
&quot;The eviction this morning was disgusting and shows that deep down Bloomberg is more interested in preserving financial interests than those of American workers,&quot; added the movement&#39;s spokesman, who accused the mayor of &quot;disrespecting the freedom of expression&quot;.
Those responsible for &quot;Occupy Wall Street&quot; also indicated that they plan to organize &quot;big actions&quot; for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two-month long protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will play the Virgin Mary in a Christmas TV special
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television show &quot;It&#39;s a Russell Peters Christmas&quot; on December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen&#39;s assistant in &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, a lifeguard in &quot;Baywatch&quot;, a &quot;Playboy&quot; bunny, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with &quot;crooner&quot; (balladeer) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television program &quot;It&#39;s a Russell Peters Christmas&quot; next December 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV released footage from the TV show today in which Anderson, also known for the wide internet distribution of a pornographic home video in which she appears with her then-husband, &quot;Mötley Crüe&quot; drummer Tommy Lee, is dressed as the Virgin Mary holding a doll representing Jesus in a manger.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian-Indian comedian who recently hosted part of Charlie Sheen&#39;s &quot;My Violent Torpedo of Truth&quot; tour, appears as Jose.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is no stranger to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian a &quot;slut&quot; during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the downward spiral that began in March
Since last March the Japanese economy had been paralyzed, still convalescing from the devastating earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe that the Japanese country suffered since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo put material losses at 300,000 million dollars, a blow that, despite the difficult world context, seems to have attenuated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the data for the Gross Domestic Product between July and September served to definitively turn the page: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% in the annualized rate.
The one registered in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the highest rate of growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is explained, in part, by the increase in the purchase of machinery to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decrease in capital expenditures that was observed from January to March, the first setback after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the true revulsion of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of crises to reinforce - or rebuild - infrastructures, use deficiencies to grow from scratch.
Japan has woken up, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japan&#39;s GDP.
This variable climbed 1%, driven by the increase in spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the &quot;safe haven values&quot; chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro zone and the murky forecasts for the US. ., a privilege that weighs heavily on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic waterline is determined by the health of big tech groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, attributed their weak results between July and September to the price of the yen.
While the markets continue with their siege on the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lower its guard.
&quot;We must be attentive to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen,&quot; said Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa, yesterday.
And, indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) specified that the majority of member countries presented clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates turning points in the world economy highlighted that the main powers are holding back.
Since it dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro zone even fell below the average, which is at level 100, falling eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens feeds doubts again
Papadimos says adjustments will pass but Conservatives won&#39;t sign any written commitment
With peripheral risk premia skyrocketing and uncertainty reinstated in stock markets, Greece continues to entangle itself in the maze that leads to the end of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the &quot;consensus&quot; of the new Hellenic transitional government is imposed more by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed with facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment may fall short to apply them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections on the scheduled date of February 19.
&quot;The main task of this government is to apply the decisions of the summit on October 26,&quot; Papadimos asserted when opening a parliamentary debate yesterday that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package with 24 programs to boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras&#39;s message does not clear up doubts about his position: &quot;We have promised to help the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else.&quot;
The conservative leader went one step further in his fight against the EU and the IMF, the organizations that must unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to comply with the settings.
But the European Commission, still stung by the impact caused by the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unblock the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign &quot;a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible.
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors will return &quot;very soon&quot; to Athens to discuss with the new government &quot;what is needed to pay the sixth tranche&quot; of 8,000 million, although there is no definitive date either.
The Greek skein still has thread for a while.
Doña Sofía: &quot;They are instruments for progress and hope&quot;
The Queen highlights the &quot;preponderant&quot; place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain &quot;has reached a preponderant place worldwide in the role of Microfinance&quot;.
Queen Sofía recalled yesterday that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the raises in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose &quot;essence&quot; pointed out that it lies in being an &quot;instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being&quot;.
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that &quot;there is no doubt&quot; that this type of operations are &quot;absolutely essential&quot; to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with a 2015 horizon, and, &quot; especially, in the one whose goal is to reduce by half the volume of people living with incomes of less than one dollar a day, with which the &quot;poverty threshold&quot; is set.
Spain &quot;continues working&quot; to expand the network of beneficiaries &quot;to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with &quot;responsibility&quot;, said Doña Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originating from the Summit, which will last until on Thursday, &quot;guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women&quot;, the main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are &quot;many achievements&quot; and &quot;many challenges we face.&quot;
The Microcredit Summit is proposed not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to promote &quot;two basic goals&quot;.
Thus, His Majesty explained that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families that have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these households will rise above the poverty line in which they are submerged.
The impulse in the conception of microcredits in Spain and in the rest of the world &quot;has followed the pioneering path begun years ago&quot; by Muhammad Yunus, Doña Sofía highlighted as an &quot;act of justice and due recognition&quot;.
And it is that he described the father of this tool as an &quot;admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty&quot;, whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about his loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in the Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and &quot;in all of them I have been able to verify the continuous evolution&quot;, explained His Majesty, whose relationship with this project earned him yesterday the description of the &quot;head of the family&quot; gathered in Valladolid by the &quot;baquero of the poor&quot;.
Finally, Queen Sofía concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
&quot;ethical imperative&quot;
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity &quot;is an ethical imperative&quot; for all democratic states.
In this sense, he explained that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, since it is a &quot;permanent obligation.&quot;
Jiménez considered that microcredits suppose &quot;a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty&quot;, and now &quot;more than ever&quot; the governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be a victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is &quot;one of the main lines of development cooperation.&quot;
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded &quot;the success&quot; of giving &quot;confidence&quot; to people &quot;excluded to whom everyone closes the doors&quot;; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that &quot;opens its doors infected with the spirit of solidarity&quot;.
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU), Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democratic party.
Initially, the future of Europe had not been on the agenda, but the issue came to the fore in the autumn, in particular to satisfy militants who believe that the government&#39;s policy is currently too lax with the Greeks and could be so in a future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were registered.
The standing ovation of several minutes that Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Finance Minister, earned with their speeches, clear up any possible doubt.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summarized in a slogan: the answer to the crisis &quot;is not less Europe, but more Europe&quot;.
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because &quot;nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.&quot;
For the Chancellor, &quot;the time has come to make headway in Europe.&quot;
This could manifest itself in modifications to the Treaty of Lisbon to allow the European Union to strengthen control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to &quot;give a face to Europe&quot;.
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
To be sure, the twenty-seven are unlikely to agree quickly on this sea change: Britain is hostile to it, and the CDU leadership seems to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is, too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the European Central Bank directive according to the weight of each economy, which would obviously reinforce the weight of Germany.
Eager to calm down within her party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But neither is it that he tried to win over his congress at the expense of &quot;small&quot; European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe dedicates a section to the importance of &quot;Franco-German friendship&quot;, Angela Merkel has not mentioned France.
Except in passing.
Remembering that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon&#39;s army.
The incidence of fraud in sick leave
After the subsidies, the UMP and the Government undertake an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a fund responsible for family allowances and give a speech on the theme, which has been recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and the assistantship.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which starts from the will to save rigorously, but is still reminiscent of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on sick leave.
In the first place, to apply budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day of absence on private sector workers before being able to take leave.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days of salary, that is, a minimum of 15% of their monthly income.
It is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: imposing a day of grace period without remuneration on officials in case of sick leave (so far, they have no grace period, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector). .
While these issues are being debated, the majority again put the issue of fraud on the table, this time oriented towards the abuse of sick leave.
&quot;Controls are going to be increased considerably and, furthermore, if someone is discovered committing fraud, they will have to repay the amounts,&quot; warned Xavier Bertrand speaking on RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement seem slightly out of proportion to the reality of fraud in terms of sick leave.
In fact, since 2002 this issue has been constantly monitored and various political offensives have been launched that have usually borne fruit.
The French do not get sick more than in the rest of Europe.
Let&#39;s look carefully, first of all, at the national figures.
According to the French Social Security Institute (CNAM), in 2006 more than 237 million euros were paid in sick leave benefits.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, sickness benefits represented, in 2008, 5% of health spending, amounting to 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46% corresponds to maternity leave and work accidents, while 54% is related to sick leave, a figure that amounts to 6,200 million euros.
Consequently, 2.5% of spending on health.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that undoubtedly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management company Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed stated that they had not taken a single day of sick leave .
Another study, in this case from Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer.
Compared to our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than other areas to take sick leave.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the rate of overall absence from work (both for health and other reasons) in France ranged between 10% and 11% , compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sick leave fraud is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud is fairly limited in scope.
The reinforcement of the legislation, since 2002, has caused the controls of sick leave of more than 45 days to be systematic.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM verified, in 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that the short-term leave was &quot;unjustified or too long&quot;, that is, 37,050 cases.
In the case of absences of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11% of the cases were considered to be &quot;duly adapted or unjustified; a figure that, taking a total of 1.2 million as a starting point, amounts to 132,000.
Consequently, a total of 169,000 &quot;unjustified&quot; cases is reached among several million workers who took sick leave.
Undoubtedly, an insignificant figure compared, for example, with the work in the black.
According to UMP deputy Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, such a practice would represent lost tax revenue of between 9 and 15 billion euros per year, that is, more than the total cost of subsidies for lower and, without a doubt, considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papadémos: Greece must apply a new adjustment plan
Greece is going to need a new adjustment plan to get its economy back on track.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos declared before Parliament on Monday, November 14; He also added that the one hundred days that have been granted to his Union Government would not be enough to achieve this objective.
&quot;In order to carry out efforts that lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme&quot;, declared the Head of Government, who was delivering his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence to Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions adopted during the Eurozone Summit on October 27 will be the &quot;main task&quot; of the new government, since &quot;at stake&quot; is the country&#39;s permanence in the eurozone, he added.
Consequently, Papadémos has predicted that the country&#39;s public deficit will be reduced &quot;to around 9%&quot; of GDP before the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, on Monday showed his support for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
&quot;We will not vote in favor of new measures,&quot; he said during a meeting with deputies from his &quot;New Democracy&quot; party.
He indicated that he agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, as well as the fight against waste, but against any policy that impedes economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary 8 billion euro loan without a written guarantee of all-party support for the planned measures, Antonio Samaras responded that his word would be enough and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
A committee of experts affirms that euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just for cancer.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included the participation of six experts from various fields, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Penal Code in such a way that assisted suicide and euthanasia are allowed, when the patient considers this option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To begin, the experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks tenth, the study notes that &quot;the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to discuss death.&quot;
With medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the fact that most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this sense is recorded by Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in hospitals.
Regarding the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not wish to modify the Penal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide. assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offense has not led to a abuse of its application, that is, the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with people who are not competent or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, stated yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
&quot;In Canada, euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal.&quot;
&quot;Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal,&quot; explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
Let&#39;s remember that 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favor of euthanasia, since they believe that it would allow people who are close to death to alleviate their suffering, according to a survey by Angus Reid carried out in 2010.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
Regarding the people who have practiced assisted suicide, 41% of those surveyed believe that a process should not be initiated against them.
In relation to the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report.
In addition, among their recommendations they suggest that it be indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of health care, if it has been legally rejected, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The committee of experts also requests that health professionals be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses care at the end of his life without fear of facing a complaint.
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just for cancer.
Finally, regarding palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in healthcare institutions in Canada, the committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be considered euthanasia and subjected to the same procedures.
Other experts express reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their reservations in relation to the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the position of the experts who sign the report as &quot;extreme&quot;, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to the terminally ill.
&quot;This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and is over the age of 18 can ask for help to commit suicide,&quot; says Deschamps, who viewed a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report appear to give priority to personal autonomy over any other societal value.
However, he adds that &quot;in society, there are labels and limitations.&quot;
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her &quot;strong opposition&quot; to the report&#39;s conclusions, calling it a &quot;manifesto in favor of euthanasia.&quot;
Margaret Somerville, who is also a member of the Royal Society of Canada, especially questions the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President Assad to step down from power
Damascus denounces a &quot;plot&quot;
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar El Asad&#39;s partisans demonstrated yesterday in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday the diplomatic pressure on Bashar El Assad&#39;s Syria intensified, which, with the support of Russia, resists it and denounces that there is a &quot;plot&quot; against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has tightened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria&#39;s neighbors, have demonstrated in favor of the relinquishment of power by President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader yesterday to ask President Bachar El Assad to &quot;abandon power&quot; in Syria, where forty civilians and members of the regime&#39;s forces have already died.
&quot;If Bachar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life,&quot; said the king of Jordan, Syria&#39;s neighbor, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that the mediation efforts that Turkey has been carrying out since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
&quot;Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave,&quot; he declared, referring to Syria, a neighboring country on which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States welcomed the &quot;strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the&quot; Syrian regime.
&quot;The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly tough tone&quot; regarding the crackdown in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces have already been killed in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) has announced.
Two other civilians have died &quot;during shelling and heavy machine gun fire in Jobar&quot; in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, the Syrian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid Al Mualem, for his part, considered that the country &quot;advances towards the end of the crisis&quot;.
In addition, he has reacted strongly to the Arab League&#39;s decision to suspend Damascus from its functions, which in his opinion constitutes &quot;a dangerous step&quot;.
Syria &quot;will not falter,&quot; he added, guaranteeing that &quot;the plots hatched against Syria will fail.&quot;
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a &quot;civilian protection mechanism&quot; and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, has also expressed his support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which, in his opinion, is locked in &quot;paranoia&quot;.
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to fine-tune the application of the crisis exit plan adopted on November 2, which provides, in particular, for the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities that are in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detained demonstrators.
The Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, yesterday judged the Arab League&#39;s decision &quot;incorrect&quot;, while China urged Syria to apply the crisis exit plan, although it did not state its support for the application of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks the markets for time and sacrifices to the Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and launch a program that will include &quot;sacrifices&quot; aimed at recovering the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner debated yesterday with the political parties and today met with the unions and employers.
It should form a relatively small cabinet, made up of technocrats from outside Parliament.
&quot;Monti has spoken of a broad program with many sacrifices,&quot; said Francesco Nucara, deputy from one of the many small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, after having met with the appointed President of the Council.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, stated that he hopes that Mario Monti will request a vote of confidence in Parliament before Friday to guarantee that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation, by Mr. Monti, of a limited list, no doubt of a dozen Ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking them for time.
In &quot;democracy, there are precise deadlines&quot; to form a government and prepare its program, he stressed, adding that he is &quot;sure that the markets will be patient and understand.&quot;
His appointment by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but concerns later set in, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should create a team primarily made up of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include &quot;politicians&quot;.
The new government will have to work until 2013, the date of the next legislative ones, he considers.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will obtain a vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday.
Monti has promised that, when he takes office, he will work taking into account the urgency and with the aim of Italy &quot;regaining its leading role&quot; in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that &quot;even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change.&quot;
The EU, convinced that Rome will not reach its objective of achieving a balanced budget in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for the adoption of new rigorous measures.
The Italian &quot;boss of bosses&quot; Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him mate, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, &quot;since a country that does not grow cannot respect the deficit requirements.&quot;
Monti, famous for his competence and his independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a &quot;change of era&quot; for Italy after 17 years of &quot;berlusconismo&quot;; the &quot;professor&quot; symbolizes &quot;the challenge of seriousness&quot; and &quot;another Italy&quot;, according to the editorialists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to place some 200,000 million euros in state bonds before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in developing a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
To identify the researcher, the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by said UN agency.
The IAEA expressed last week its &quot;serious concern&quot; about a &quot;possible military dimension&quot; of Iran&#39;s nuclear program.
According to the ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, in a Soviet military nuclear center in Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by burst.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of &quot;nanodiamonds&quot; in kyiv.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact, in 1995, the Embassy of Iran in Ukraine.
Later, he is believed to have cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are &quot;clear indications that Iran is developing&quot; a nuclear detonation system &quot;with the help of a foreign expert, who was not only well versed in the technique, but also, as reported by a State member of the Agency, he worked for most of his career on such technology in his home country&#39;s military nuclear program.
Crimes and offenses against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and offenses against Muslims have increased by nearly 50% between 2009 and 2010, while all other types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics released by the FBI. on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has risen from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is, it has increased by 49%, compared to a rise of 13% in the case of acts of violence. against Catholics, a 4% reduction in crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14% in the number of anti-religious crimes and offenses.
The total number of &quot;hate crimes&quot; has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
&quot;After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these types of crimes and offenses have increased again,&quot; said the human rights organization Human Rights First, &quot;the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is especially significant,&quot; the organization added in a statement.
&quot;Human Rights First has long argued that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,&quot; added an organization official, Paul Legendre.
&quot;The US government can and should work to end such abuses,&quot; he adds, noting that such efforts could include improved police reporting of &quot;hate crimes.&quot;
The &quot;hate crime&quot; in US federal law was inherited from the civil rights days.
Said legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter modified the presentation of its platform on Monday to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, making its service look a little more like Facebook.
A new &quot;activity&quot; tab and another called &quot;name&quot; allow you to follow more easily and live the activity of other &quot;Twittos&quot;, that is, those Internet users whose messages (&quot;tweets&quot;) you follow on the Internet or who follow you.
This allows you to know if they follow up on messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they qualify any message as a favorite, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested &quot;with a small percentage of users in August&quot; before it was released to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its non-instinctive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward someone else&#39;s message, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s&#39;ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec a maniement plus comparable to celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the net, users have debated the interest of this innovation through &quot;tweets&quot; with different opinions.
&quot;It&#39;s useless, invasive and too much like Facebook,&quot; writes @jemb123.
&quot;The Activity feature is going to help me better track some elements of my Twitter stream,&quot; writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a budget &quot;golden rule&quot; in the Constitution
The Social Democratic/Christian Democrat grand coalition government in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a budgetary &quot;golden rule&quot; to reduce the public deficit and, thus, avoid a possible downgrading of Austria&#39;s sovereign note by part of the credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure well above the maximum limit of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly less than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
&quot;If Austria&#39;s creditworthiness were reduced by just one notch, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay 3 billion euros more in interest every year,&quot; said Christian Democrat Deputy Chancellor for Foreign Affairs Michael Spindelegger.
Thus, Austria responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the member countries of the euro zone on October 26: in it, the Heads of State and Government requested the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a Law with equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the &quot;German model&quot;, since Germany was the first European country to adopt this type of &quot;rule&quot;.
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, starting in 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal State should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year. GDP, while the regional States, as well as the communes, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is that, by 2020/2021, the public debt is reduced under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
a strong yen
Noda threatens a new exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the exchange rate marking if the yen continued to rise.
&quot;We will intervene, as we did last time, if we see excessive volatility&quot; in the yen exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to reach levels close to all-time highs that prompted the intervention of the Japanese authorities on October 31.
That day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars to lower the value of Japan&#39;s currency, which had just hit a new record since 1945 against the US currency.
But the yen has steadily rallied ever since, buoyed by investors who see it as a &quot;safe haven&quot; in these uncertain times of a global economic slowdown and European debt crisis.
The dollar returned to trading on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those that caused the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen and the euro was above 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency hurts exports from the archipelago, since it makes Made in Japan products more expensive and reduces the value of the income obtained abroad by Japanese companies when they are converted into the national currency.
&quot;Japan is struggling to rebuild&quot; after the earthquake and tsunami on March 11, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), said Noda, who fears that the rise in the yen will nip the weak recovery in the bud.
The third world economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5% in relation to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the catastrophe.
But the Prime Minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect &quot;Japan&#39;s economic fundamentals.&quot;
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
However, the institution&#39;s Deputy Governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken &quot;appropriate measures&quot;, hinting that further monetary easing should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuance institute increased its purchases of Treasury Bills by five trillion yen (47,000 million euros), bringing the funds threshold to 55 trillion yen (519,000 million euros). which he dedicates to the acquisition of various financial titles to flood the market with liquidity.
euro area:
rates grow, stocks falter
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to hurt European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in the weakest countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro zone stability, European stock markets plunge a little deeper into the negative zone on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 am, the CAC 40 lost 1.4% and stood at 3,064 points.
The Dax lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
&quot;Given the new tensions regarding the loan yields of the hardest-hit eurozone states, stock markets around the world continue to deliver some of their recent gains.&quot;
&quot;Nervous investors are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion,&quot; explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a fall of 0.7%, renewing the concerns of market participants regarding Europe&#39;s ability to contain the debt crisis.
&quot;Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes fixed on Europe and the exchanges will continue to be carried out with a small margin of variations, so that investors will have no proof that the situation has stabilized,&quot; considers Mitsushige Akino, manager of funds at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The reappearance of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to brokers, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s party, the CDU, which met in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion that provides, in particular, for the option of a country in difficulties leaving the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are well above 6%
Loan rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
As of Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds stood at 6.85%, while Spanish 10-year bonds offered 6.2%.
These tensions in relation to the interest rates of the southern countries, but also of France, continue to feed the fears of the financial controllers.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which is at risk of suffocating under the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has stated that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on October 27 would be the &quot;main task&quot; of his government.
Spain is in the crosshairs of the markets, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The difference in rates (&quot;spread&quot;) between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new all-time high.
Waiting for growth figures for the euro area
From a statistical point of view, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, ie a more favorable figure than the 0.3% forecast, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised downward the figure for the second quarter, with a reduction of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded growth of 0.5% in the same period.
The first forecasts for the whole of the euro area are expected at 11 am, after the European Commission has warned about the risk of a new recession.
Energetic politics:
facts must be worth more than dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be dealt with taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an electoral meeting is the moment to reflect on such questions and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it looks at the full economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7,000 million people on the planet, demographic trends will mean that electricity demand will double before 2050, unless a huge part of the world&#39;s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to alleviate the increasing scarcity of fossil resources to continue producing electricity continuously, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the debate. ecological.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany stands alone in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case neither in Belgium, which submits its power to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, nor in Switzerland, which only aims to build state-of-the-art plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few examples, are forging ahead with their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a plant that was interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, reality goes against such discourse.
Choosing Berlin is going to lead to an increase in the price of electricity, greater energy dependence due to the increased need for imported gas, particularly from Russia, and an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal power plants.
In a few months, the detrimental effects will be noticeable.
The case of Denmark should be considered.
Champion of Europe in the wind sector, from which it obtains 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the large users of coal and gas due to the intermittency of the wind; For this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear power would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, making the wonderful statements about reindustrializing our country and defending our purchasing power less realistic.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, show no principled opposition to such energy, polls show.
Let us remember that the energy policy of our country has lost building an industrial sector with 125,000 director jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it encompasses a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and that can create non-relocatable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would mean the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of 6,000 million euros a year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would commission an EPR designed to function for sixty years, when the collapse of its manufacturer is foreseen?
To solve the nuclear power equation, one must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no devilish source.
Areva&#39;s development of low CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a Safety Authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both the existing plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, at Three Mile Island, was produced under normal operating conditions; It caused no consequences for people or the environment.
At Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and some inexcusable human error.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural catastrophes of unprecedented scope, killing tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, just as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to these advances and a cooperation between the safety authorities, and the French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While being studied by all electricity players who want to build a plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since it would free them to assume the leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers to dominate a debate so important to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of &quot;country of rights humans&quot; from France.
More recently, it is the administrative bullying of foreign students that has made headlines, with the Interior Minister (see Libération newspaper May 23) proclaiming in past that France &quot;does not need foreign talent, workers or waiters&quot;.
However, it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the tone by declaring in 1976 that &quot;900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with close to two million immigrant workers&quot;, while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard explaining that France &quot;cannot take care of all the misery in the world&quot; in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of the national territory by a mob of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act towards immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande limits himself to including banalities, indicating that co-development will make it possible to solve the &quot;migration problem&quot;.
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electorally profitable, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarizing the latest insights on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.) , there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migratory flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
Limiting immigration weakens growth and hurts employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, particularly low-skilled ones, by pressing for lower wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are more complementary than substitutes for national workers and mainly practice professions in sectors with a lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for personnel.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country that lacks anesthetists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants means that the arrival of the latter has a positive influence on the salaries and employment of nationals.
Taking the above into account, Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migratory flows implies a rise in real wages in the long term of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And regardless of the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there are a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel laureates, and companies like Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay, and Yahoo were founded). by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, since they contribute an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labor Organization calculates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenses) of 150,000 euros to public budgets on average throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the growth points he was missing &quot;with his teeth&quot;.
Such teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it just needs to think about a European democracy
Democracy is a precious asset, but it is also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember this since, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the 20th century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some perhaps believed that, for democracy to definitively triumph over its enemies, it would be enough to exercise the vote and in the most direct way possible.
We know, since Napoleon &quot;the Little&quot;, that it was something thought.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not sufficient by itself and can even become an &quot;instrument of oppression&quot;, as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, education, Enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinodia of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return to the political sphere, but also the worrying sensation of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be reflected upon in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, the Republican soldiers are no longer advancing in the right direction.
We will not gain by demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to need and in a haphazard manner.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or an empty stop to the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to pull off coups, but rather a common, full-fledged, calm and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at a European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that submits to the orders of the markets and the rating agencies, than the one that suffers from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers humiliation in the international sphere.
We worry about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all of Europe that is slowly losing sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty recovers the helm of the European project.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce their debt burden, free themselves from the markets and prepare their future through investment.
The way out of the crisis will require decisions at a European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
After having fought for a long time against this proposal of the socialists and Jacques Delors, the whole world is now calling for European economic governance.
So be it.
But to think of it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being experienced as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new impasse.
We must assume a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to &quot;make&quot; republicans.
Revolution motivated by interests would not be enough.
This lesson still applies.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe on the political level, a true European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, let&#39;s make Europeans.
Contactless chip cards go mainstream
The world chip card show opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, the year 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, telephones with SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6,000 million units, according to calculations by the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most powerful segment is that of contactless technology, which makes it possible to pay for common transport or purchases simply by touching the card to a reader.
This year 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units are forecast) and represent close to 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payment sector.
Around 26 million Visa bank cards already have this function, which is accepted at 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard cards this year.
To put the top gear, however, it is necessary for banks to make them available to their customers.
&quot;There are two large French establishments that have committed themselves to systematically disseminate bank cards equipped with the contactless system to their customers in the future&quot;, announces Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile phone payment
But it only constitutes a first stage towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, essential for carrying out transactions.
&quot;They&#39;re falling behind.&quot;
&quot;But it should finally experience a real boom next year.&quot;
&quot;We forecast that between 80 and 120 million units will be sold in 2012 worldwide,&quot; explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Crédit agricole bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 clients and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale has also affirmed yesterday that it is preparing the commercialization of an offer that allows its clients to pay without contact through their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-suspected links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Algiers already &quot;has the certainty&quot;.
&quot;The way in which both organizations operate and the reports from the intelligence services show that they are cooperating,&quot; he explained, without providing further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the catwalks.
Kidnapped from a restaurant in Niamey by people associated with Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their captors during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
terrorist axis
The study of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers particularly caught the interest of investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who He is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
&quot;This is progress, but we must certainly wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.&quot;
&quot;But it is possible&quot;.
&quot;We have known for years that the sect enjoys outside financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active,&quot; says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, said &quot;support&quot; had become increasingly evident in the evolution and discourse of Boko Haram or in its operational modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices of the same style as those used. by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has been pressing Abuja ever since to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities have, in fact, long regarded the group as an uninteresting community of illuminati.
a quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in Hausa, &quot;Western education is a sin&quot;), incites the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the north Nigerian Muslim.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It becomes politicized and demands strict respect for sharia law, while its militants launch into the fight against the impious central government.
The latter are oriented first of all to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were especially active and attacks against police stations multiplied.
The reaction from Abuja was, as is often the case, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 deaths were recorded.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested while alive, dies in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, he claimed responsibility for an attack that caused 80 deaths in Jos and, later, another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuja, in particular against the sheltered police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local United Nations headquarters becomes their first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would cover from Mauritania to Somalia passing through Nigeria, worries all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Chebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and stated that he was ready to &quot;share all information&quot;.
The world according to the Republican candidates for the Presidency
When it comes to China, Iran, and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival each other in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the Republican presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making more and more thunderous statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strong point.
Slogans, often unfounded, are spread about China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the top-ranked candidate in the race for the &quot;Grand Old Party&quot; nomination, has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and sue them &quot;for currency manipulation,&quot; a key issue in an America exasperated by migration of entire fragments of your industry to Asia.
It doesn&#39;t matter if that implies the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama&#39;s former Ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost choked on an attitude that &quot;overwhelms&quot; the emotions.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama&#39;s current position).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
Reagan-style
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt its nuclear program.
&quot;If I get elected, I&#39;ll stop Iran,&quot; he boasted.
&quot;If Obama gets re-elected, they&#39;ll have the bomb.&quot;
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed in his obligations in relation to that partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second highest ranked candidate, for his part shows a shameful ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing &quot;attempts to develop nuclear capability,&quot; apparently ignoring the fact that China has had the military atom since 1964.
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he, for his part, is willing to deploy the US military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a foreign policy heavyweight.
Opponents of the current President counter that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
Remember that Obama himself was an amateur and had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the hasty departure of the &quot;boys&quot; from Iraq and on his misrepresentations in Libya, and label him weak.
But attacks are not easy for them.
The population judges Obama&#39;s balance of national security, which ended with Bin Laden, in a rather positive way.
From Iraq, he is wary of military interventions that cause a collapse.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more fair.
The Nord Stream, the new gateway for Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe with Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, amid the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, at the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart from the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have together turned the handwheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the network. Western Europe.
With this new pipeline, each year an additional 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive in Western Europe through a first pipeline of 1,224 km that connects the Saint Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second tube should be completed by the end of 2012, which will make it possible to supply a total of 55,000 million cubic meters of gas, that is, enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube along the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this enormous work presents an air of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will make it possible to supply gas directly to Germany, avoiding the land route through third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: it will be more difficult for them to influence Russia by threatening to cut off its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a &quot;new German-Soviet pact&quot;, referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of energy Europe, as the project has driven a wedge between eastern and western Europeans.
Russia has managed, in just five years, to make its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large consumers of gas and with increasingly limited reserves, triumph.
&quot;This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically,&quot; confirmed François Fillon during the pipeline&#39;s inauguration, demonstrating the extent to which large contracts in the gas sector are as political as they are economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the Gazprom managers, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of steel coated with cement to protect it against the anchors of ships.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from World War II.
&quot;It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution,&quot; says Jens Müller, spokesman for the Nord Stream company.
Likewise, it was necessary to take extreme measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs about 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted along its entire length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Swedish waters, but those responsible for the project gave it up when they saw that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state-owned company to establish itself permanently in the sea off their coasts.
&quot;In the event of a fault, we will interrupt the gas flow in less than a minute,&quot; says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider a leak unlikely, since they have planned joints that are predicted to leak every 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the gas pipeline is guaranteed by an underwater robot, towed by a ship, which performs external inspections, as well as by a device that circulates inside the gas pipeline.
Shaped like a cigar, it is inserted inside the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides precise data on possible deformations of the metal.
The gas pipeline has been designed to function for fifty years without the need for any type of repair.
The circulation of the gas is guaranteed simply by the pressure.
At the beginning it is 200 bars and at the exit it is 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
It was joined by the Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a common company, called Nord Stream, in charge of building and operating the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is especially favourable.
Subsequently, Gazprom leased to said company, for a renewable period of twenty-five years, all of the gas transport capacities.
&quot;Gazprom will be paid for the full capacity, regardless of how much gas is actually transported,&quot; says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline has been carried out 30% with the contribution of shareholders and 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7,400 million euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure they will not out-invest, as Gazprom itself bears the risk of spending.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic at Lubmin, on a sandy shore lined with pine trees.
Some valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas exit door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas upon arrival, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a branded notebook.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people back a taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, of hours of writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular covers, its rubber, its off-white pages, as if aged by time.
However, Moleskine notebooks in their current look were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that moment to launch a designer but distinguished notebook on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, at that time a consultant for the company, was in charge of launching the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover sidewalks.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
&quot;Moleskine has adapted to current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,&quot; says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become head of the brand at Modo Modo.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Gone is the confidential production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook attracts businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which had twelve employees at its inception, now has close to 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from Fnac to small shops in the center of cities, and has managed to impose his identity.
&quot;We have adapted to the times and to the need to write, despite the rise of emails&quot;, explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the &quot;Detour&quot; exhibition where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, it also launched a notebook with leopard covers, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, diaries, pens, computer cases... The brand covers a wide range of media.
An envy-inducing success: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in Moleskine&#39;s history.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
The XV Week for the employment of the disabled begins today.
Despite a resolute public policy, applied since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people is double the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the population as a whole.
Discouraging?
&quot;No&quot;, affirms Éric Blanchet, general director of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
&quot;The progress achieved in the last fifteen years is considerable.
&quot;Back then, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
&quot;However, there is still a lot to do.&quot;
It is worth mentioning that the disabled unemployed continue to face many obstacles in accessing employment.
They tend to be older: 37% are over 50 (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not finished high school and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
In other words, there are numerous issues that make it particularly difficult to return to the world of work and that &quot;are the crux of the problem,&quot; says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those that are not mentioned; the mentality of the people advances, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association for the Cité pointed out that the directors surveyed have &quot;a low level of knowledge about disabilities&quot;, with an &quot;excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physically or intellectually handicapped&quot;.
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are very far from the objective of hiring 6% of disabled workers, an objective that was set in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest figures available, dating from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
&quot;Now we reach around 3%,&quot; says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body in charge of collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The proof: the number of establishments &quot;subject to this contribution&quot;, as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, going from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
&quot;The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has created great pressure for companies,&quot; explains Pierre Blanc.
&quot;But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, particularly among large groups.&quot;
According to the Ministry of Labor, only 59% of companies with between 20 and 49 workers have disabled employees on their staff, compared to 82% of companies with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: &quot;A joy&quot;
About to face Les Bleus on Tuesday evening (8:45 pm), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly match generates for them.
We will not dare to say that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the dais in the auditorium at the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have truly made amends.
Five months after his striker&#39;s grudge against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
&quot;I was very happy for Eden, for his progress and for being Belgian.&quot;
&quot;I want to move forward,&quot; the Lille striker replies.
As for the contrast between his presentations in his team and in the national team, &quot;it is a group&quot;, it has been justified.
&quot;In Lille, I am all year round, which does not apply to Belgium.
&quot;I have to position myself.&quot;
Called up to play against Romania on Friday night, with this match against France in mind, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally &quot;shine&quot;.
Without forgetting the &quot;pleasure&quot;.
He has been supporting Les Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
&quot;I&#39;ve always been his fan,&quot; he says.
Without a doubt, this will especially reinforce the &quot;particular&quot; character of the meeting.
Especially since he will face &quot;Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)&quot;, he recalls.
&quot;We just met recently.
&quot;Playing against them is always a joy.&quot;
With simplicity, Leekens has made for his part reference to &quot;pride&quot;.
&quot;Pride&quot; for playing &quot;a gala match&quot;.
&quot;Pride&quot; also for verifying, as a &quot;neighbor&quot;, that France &quot;is once again a very high-level team&quot;, nearly a year after the Knysna trauma.
&quot;Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job,&quot; he enthused.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the coach would be delighted to be able to share a plane with Les Bleus to... Brazil, in 2014.
&quot;Our little Belgians are growing,&quot; he stressed.
&quot;We are building something; the players are ambitious, they are hungry.
&quot;They will be able to see it in the next games.&quot; Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Paulo Bento&#39;s Portugal faces the return match against Bosnia (10:00 pm) with great optimism, which will take place on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first leg, both teams lacked realism.
&quot;When these 90 minutes are up, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.&quot;
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt; the Selecçao, which he has led since September 2010, is going to qualify for Euro 2012.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Taking into account the first leg (0-0), on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems clear that the matter is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for over an hour, yes, but they couldn&#39;t score the valuable goal that would have given them peace of mind.
&quot;It&#39;s a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven&#39;t scored away from home.&quot;
But at home, in Lisbon&#39;s bright Estadio de la Luz, the Portuguese are convinced they will go through, in front of a crowd that should be just as enthusiastic, even if it is clear that the game is &quot;very close&quot;, says an optimistic but lucid.
&quot;We expect the game to be very even, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead,&quot; said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
&quot;We still have a 50% chance of participating in Euro 2012,&quot; however, Carlos Queiroz&#39;s successor has relativized.
Friday&#39;s draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a draw, although they also need to score.
&quot;It&#39;s a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven&#39;t scored away from home,&quot; laments Bento.
&quot;We are going to play against a team that has great technical quality and that has players with great individual quality,&quot; he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to &quot;not leave them time to think.&quot;
A good idea, as long as, this time, it is realistic.
