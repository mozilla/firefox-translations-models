The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
The transactions of the shares of EZ reached approximately half of the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, early on Tuesday, reacted immediately to Monday's fall when it fell to about 6%.
The drop this time is due to the fall in Wall Street shares.
The market reaction to the outcome of the American Assembly of Representatives voting, which refused to support the stabilization plan of the secretary of the financial sector, is also expressed here.
Fall of shares in Asia
Asian stock markets fell sharply on Tuesday, although throughout the day the index finally mitigated some of the losses.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Stock Exchange index over its financial day was almost four percent, although it later mitigated its losses by reducing the decline by almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that follows the movements of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell 3.8 percent, in Shanghai markets were closed.
Shares in the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five per cent but in the end losses fell to 4.3 per cent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the index's secretary, fell to 3.6 percent.
"The U.S.-scheduled rescue actions are unsafe and this influences the financial market around the world," said Hong Kong's Currency Office Chief Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it only determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong interest rates are on the same level as those of the United States.
American lawmakers should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody bath of American actions
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the financial system aid plan to which $700 billion (about 12 trillion kronor) should be spent.
Lawmakers, in this way, ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, American shares experienced a bloody bathroom and mainly the stock index picked up the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell to nearly seven percent. A similar volume drop was last recorded in 1987.
The index dropped already before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly's proposal did not go ahead, the index began to fall freely.
Congress withdraws: U.S. government can inject $700 billion into banking
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, they agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial aid to the American finance system.
His vote will be held early next week.
American lawmakers caused a rift in talks on the approval of the bailout plan in the form of aid to the American financial system with the $700 billion (about 12 trillion kronor) amounting to the U.S. financial system.
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune some contract details before they can make public the final form of the law and get it voted on.
The financial system aid plan will be discussed Monday in the House of Representatives.
He told Reuters news agency Barney Frank, chairman of the Assembly's Committee for Financial Services and Banking on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, "disenchantment" will be achieved thanks to the complex mechanisms whose market support will also reach in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made a great breakthrough.
We resolve our dissenting views on the way the package of measures for market stabilization should have," Democrat Nancy Pelosiá told the Bloomberg agency.
The final vote could still be held on Sunday, she said.
Representatives of lawmakers met Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the government fund a final form.
This should buy from financial companies the unsold mortgage assets that lead financial companies to severe losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are about to close the plan agreement, which will work and also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue the sanitation plan, but I think we're already on it," Paulson said.
A sign for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis has an impact on the rapidly falling share market.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are doing everything they can to get Congress to definitively approve a deal this Sunday.
They want to reassure investors' businesses in the face of the Asian finance market as they are the ones in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday's trade.
For now, however, there is nothing clear for sure when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote and, even, if they will not stagnate at the last minute with any problems.
Lawmakers believe it will be approved in the next few days.
The law, however, will undergo a series of changes.
The total amount to help the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion has to be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last $350 billion.
Bush valued the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can overcome its veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was preserved, which was to gain financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to finish paying their mortgages.
"We've worked everything.
The House of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
American President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is pleased with Saturday's advance and that he values "the commitment of both sides to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy."
Limitation of the armoured contract
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the negotiators' chief, said lawmakers decided on responsibility for the taxpayer tax-protective program's money for their losses, a locking up of the programmed finance plan.
The new law should also limit so-called armoured contracts for directors of the program's participating companies, and creates a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This would have to be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it, and we have made a great step towards the agreement that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also counts on helping homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree on the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower the monthly burdens of debtors' term payments and enable them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Homeland Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but quite difficult.
"And this is why you don't know with what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be crucial for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
That the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, as relevant.
"More importantly, already this week the congressmen agree on their support and give their approval everything before you can.
This important and psychological agreement to be reached is, at the moment, the most important thing," Marek insisted.
Victory of the populist right in Austria, together they form 29 %
Early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought, according to the early results, a noticeable weakening of both parties of the current grand coalition and an expressive strengthening of the populist right-wing party.
Strong and special losses have been suffered by the Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously reeling.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, J.rg Haider, is preparing his triumphant return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, social democracy (SP) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, so it loses 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse is the OVP, which loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of the vote, is still over.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two major Austrian parties since the post-war period and especially for the popular who called these early elections.
Even in early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular had preference to the SPO, a considerable advantage.
It is clear, however, that voters punished them for letting the government shipwreck.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculations about the resignation of the party president and, until today, vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer were heard.
Observers believe that this could be achieved as early as Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party presidency.
Such an evolution would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and more approximate starting point of the election results, that is, the renewal of the grand coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both parties on the populist right - the Liberals (FPOs) have won about 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the vote - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same would be repeated in 1999 when the popular negotiated with the populists (then FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it dismembered from BZO) for a coalition government that led to a sanction by the European Union.
Haider has clearly bet on this evolution who has already announced that he is prepared to collaborate with any party and that he is already assuming his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament although it has lost slightly and dropped from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four per cent limit and therefore is not part of parliament.
Armed fight: MP3 player against mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player manages to make calls.
Which seems clear that it's best to buy just the phone.
Yet there are enough reasons for man to acquire only the player.
The choice depends practically on the way of its use and the demand of the future owner.
It will probably be hard for him to acquire the most modern record player to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
On the other hand, these types of musical products such as LP albums no longer come out, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If vinyl records are crammed into their shelves with art rock, jazz or blues music, you're probably dreaming, at least, of this kind of record player.
This is the same with the music on the way, that is, compressed, simplified music - music in MP3.
And here are categories of price and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand kronor on a breeder, as well as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the market helmets of twenty crowns.
Two ends, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is broad.
Also decides the battery life
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even that than even most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In front of the most elementary functions such as phone, sending messages, you can play music and video, record the two, have a better or worse photography device and you can even get to navigate.
And when we take the smartphone and the PDAs are going to have a small computer in their pocket as well.
This is a little miracle as no fridge knows how to make a barbecue and no TV can be photographed.
The universality of mobile phones also brings us disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile, the screen indicator will be illuminated by asking to be recharged.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy swallows.
Few mobiles manage to play music over ten or twelve hours, most of them much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) clearly have a higher performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap mobile phones will not play more than two hours.
If in addition to this, on top of this, constantly call you still, for more security, a charger for work - this is also valid for the most expensive devices.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, as even the worst endure at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem happens when recording music on your mobile.
Unfortunately only part of the devices have the universal USB connector and, moreover, not all of them can connect directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some unreduced reader units can the small memory cards used on mobiles be connected.
In players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is necessary.
Simply fill the device with music through the USB of the computer.
Most mobile phones and players create their order in the music library alone according to the interpreter's name, album title, genre or also according to user rating.
Some gadgets only show a directory with a Windows Search engine-like tree structure and some recognize both (juver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a particular team interested in the resistance of the accumulator, the capacity of memory, the quality and the type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and you will listen to it every day only for a while, as on the tram, then you have enough of any mobile phones you reproduce.
Which practically gets any mobile really.
You shouldn't even be interested in the format in which the mobile or player plays the music.
The MP3 is played by everyone and, practically, almost all the music that comes to it will be in this format.
He is among the most widespread and with the exception of the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (format used by Apple and its iPod).
The best mobile phones also make it possible, for example, to buy online music.
It is enough through the mobile internet to visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could in itself be a compelling argument for acquiring a mobile for music.
Unfortunately the offer of operators is miserable and most are limited only to the issues of fleeting radio success.
Prices aren't the lowest either.
In general, however, this way of selling music (either by GSM, internet or wireless internet) is supposed to dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry a mobile phone.
As long as you want to hear something, you'll find your cell phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether he always carries with him some headphones or, at least, handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile even if it is at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many mobiles with music will be their price.
The cheapest normally costs less than 3,000.
Between three and four thousand kronor can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will limit the absence of an entry for classic headphones.
The best, even in terms of the technical part, such as phones equipped with a 3.5 mm entrance for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - are really handled by anyone.
The minimum functions, their management similar to the previous ordinary cassettes or also the record touches is evident.
It does not pose a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the internet with the mobile phone and, consequently, gigantic account of data download.
Which device to decide
Even the cheapest mobiles (for example, Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card it will reach two thousand crowns.
Be careful, though.
The basic models are usually equipped only with a 2GB maximum capacity card.
Only the most expensive have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile phone and you want to buy yourself a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) no more than 1,100 kronor needs to be spent.
If you consider one of the most demanding music lovers, use the most specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman line phones have almost identical use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, of about four thousand crowns, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the aforementioned brand the most arria brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator is already going to arrive, this year, in the Czech Republic.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is well developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It's probably not gonna be long.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it on mobil.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech T-Smart Office, which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is one of the most expensive in the whole Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of roaming charges regulation, a paradoxical situation is likely to be reached - for some customers of Czech mobile operators the SMS they send from abroad will be cheaper than if they send them from home.
How is it possible for prices in the Czech Republic to remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there's no competition I really want to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical, because we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to lament that there is extreme competition on the Czech market.
This is also the Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (T'), Pavel Dvoák, and said that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with its own network it no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market brought a significant price drop to which the classic operators should also react.
At the same time, even before sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It was shown that there is room for these types of operators and that they can succeed.
Otherwise, there is no need to look for examples too far.
In February of this year we informed you about the premiere of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
After only half a year, this operator managed to obtain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking is the Penta group that, apart from this, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is in the possibility of concentrating on many more specific target groups.
In addition, in order for them to function effectively, they are enough with far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry with them relatively large costs in construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world, these types of virtual operators are usually profiled with low costs - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages that, however, are often offset by the supply of tighter services.
For example, mobile Tesco in Britain offers SMS at least half of the cheap ones in terms of competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it may also be a good blow to the bet also on a no trivial target group.
This operator specifically addresses the man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - it's the operator he likes and who you can trust," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which works for this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether the concept like that of Poland could hook in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Eepick is in doubt: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition from the point of view of the offer of services it is relatively saturated"
There is no possibility in the Czech Republic, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be any virtual operator in the Czech Republic that it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the R. He doesn't seem too hopeful.
Rather, it is the launch of Mobilking in other countries of our region," Jana Studnieková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group, said in a telephone conversation for mobil.cz.
Indirectly, he assured that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not bowing to this idea.
Rather the opposite, they try to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competition emerges.
Interest on the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step further to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, so that we can offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also mobile phone services.
And how much sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have repeatedly met all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have managed to move forward with the meetings," said the group's spokesman, Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe they're flashing better times.
It seems that, due to unofficial information, the first official operator would possibly have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment we believe that the situation is ideal for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has addressed us with any complex and serious project in this area," said Vlastimil Sr.e, spokesman for Telefónica O2.
Other operators are concerned about the specificity of the Czech market.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional agreement with O2's opinion, adds: "Until today we have not registered any viable commercial projects that, bilaterally profitable, can continue to develop."
He adds: "On the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find any virtual operator until the end of the year.
At the moment we should already have on the table some specific contract that could be studied on such a short horizon."
Vodafone is focusing instead on meeting the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav Eepick adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of cost- and infrastructure sharing.
Precisely we consider it the biggest contribution from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet on the mobile."
Responsible offices - with nail and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a price drop and thus a decline in profits.
Then why facilitate entry into the competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull the same string, proof of which is the grip when U:fon came up.
Perhaps the greatest pressure to the T was at the time of U:fon's entry by the T-Mobile society.
This is attested by the public information accessible on the websites of the T.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument for why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds to this: "In addition, not long ago the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was opened to a fourth operator.
As far as the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is concerned, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would be for him and, above all, for his services great requirements."
That is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just the position of the YOU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Licitations (OHS).
However, it expressed its typical position on this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile telephony market would be possible after an agreement on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile phone operator and a virtual operator is concluded.
To this day no agreement has been closed since the offer of the potential stakeholders rather was not interesting enough for the classic operators," Kristián Chalupa of the external relations department of the OHS added to our question.
These statements are not surprising to the representatives of the operators.
For offices that must represent the interests of consumers, this is more than a consideration, apart from that they must note that no one takes advantage of their position on the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "At the outside where virtual operators operate normally we can see that their entry into the market contributed to the drop in prices of mobile phone services."
Obviously, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market means and the price drop does not fall within the interest of the OHS.
The dramatically shocking thing in this whole case is the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it's really a coincidence is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline at gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and a tough fight for competition.
"The Office in this regard has found no signs of unfair competition and therefore does not have reasons for any intervention.
None of the operators have a dominant position therefore do not have a corresponding ascent of responsibility in their actions on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile phone market to virtual operators are rather lacking, as well as telecommunications regulators," Chalupa added to his response.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many conflicting points.
There is obviously a relevant market analysis prepared by the T-T that telecoms are from the point of view of commercial tendering a single market.
In this type of market naturally none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
But some of the legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator to emerge, an agreement with the network administrator is always necessary.
And the mobile phone operator - with all its logic - has a monopoly on its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for OHS should be a warning that three mobile operators are strikingly ascending in a similar way.
The current complaints of the interested parties (inlusioned by the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with the operators they clash with many similar impediments.
Loading responsibility for the T is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which the OHS washes its hands in this whole matter.
We've met him in some similar cases already.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law was recently tabled for the extension of the competence of the T in the field of commercial tenders that was not implemented, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This must be perfectly known to the representatives of O.S, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
Everything's fine, when nobody looks
At the same time, something like a pseudovirtual operator that on Czech mobile phone networks already exist a few are unnoticed.
They are companies that put their own prices on mobile phone services that, however, only one party are public.
These are usually companies that engage in multilevel marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Normally only a few of them get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with regard to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the company by commissioning a lot of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile operators prohibit this type of resale.
"If cases such as those cited could be heard as infringement under contract terms that could result in an end to collaboration with the given society," Martina Kemrová replied to the question on this issue.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity by mobile operators would not reach responsible people.
Precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned, they may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they make uns negligible profits and, at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Eepick warns us of the possible problems: "the law allows speculation of this type, however, the services of this company are used only by a negligible percent of customers.
They must also accept that their phone's SIM card is not in their name so they can't absolutely dispose of it as a normal operator customer.'
Precisely this is what it should look like to the minimally weird.
Also a new question for the OHS appears.
If mobile phone operators engulf the eyes in this type of procedure, why do they block the virtual operator's entry?
It should be added that the LOS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activity and if you are not going to want you should not be content with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this story and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive
As already made clear in the text, the virtual operator's entry into the mobile telephony market led to a significant decrease in service prices.
At the same time, in virtually every country where the virtual operator emerged, the classic operators tried to protect themselves from this break-in.
The arguments used by these were almost all identical - too small, a market, eventually too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, regulators have now intervened and in none of the cases defended the operators but their customers.
Whether with formal measures or informal pressure, they got the first virtual operator to emerge and with it others began to emerge.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory body this whole case is happening as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience we cannot fail to be impressed that the confusion of attributions in these cases suits them.
But let's not waste.
If this behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator really gets to this land, then the Czech mobile phone market will probably start moving again.
If any of the operators let any virtual mobile operator in, it will be difficult for the OHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And maybe we'll stop calling it more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the official Czech anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the day of the official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the anthem Where, my home.
The new anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiaí B.lohlávek.
There are four versions - two versions that are Solos, one male voice and the other with female voice, one with Choir and the other instrumental.
Kateina Knínková and Adam Plachetka are in charge of the song.
The authors of the anthem arrangements are Otakar Jeremiá and Jaroslav Krsek.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to the four versions.
He considers this national Czech song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio has previously said that it intentionally chose for the Solos singers with representatively young voices who are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried with both and then, also, with the Choir to be fixed in the diction so that the text would be well understood, so that it would be consonated," he said.
The official Czech anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, my Home sounded for the first time in 1834 on the tables of the Theater of the States in the original Czech work Fidlova-ka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with the music of Franti-ek .kroup.
He gained popularity and people made it their own.
The first stanza of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 naturally became part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
What the "new" hymn sounds
Prague's MHD takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the date on which the first passengers enter the subway, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets rather than a paper ticket is written in the history of the Prague Transport Company.
This can now be acquired by almost a hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day bonus and the annual bonus (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously charge it on their chip card at the infocentros and transport company posts at the Metro, Muzeum, Mostek, Nádra-í Hole-ovice, Andul, Roztyly, Let.any, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kaerov and Luka.
Bonds can already be purchased online from yesterday on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of commerce can definitely begin to forget about ticket sales stations at subway stations, where until now they had to regularly queue to take out a normal ticket.
The bonus is bought on the internet, and the Opencard card is recharged in one of the thirteen subsidiaries of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is at the disposal of passengers a window with prepared staff that helps those interested with the purchase online and also with the recharge of the bonus purchased on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic bonus at the Opencard on the automatic vending machines found in some subway lobbies.
How are these vending machines?
They are red, they remind us of a ticket bite machine and the travelers will probably have already noticed them at the Roztyly subway stations, Bud-jovická, I. Q. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the city but by the end of the year there would have to be eighty," Opatrná concluded.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Simply enter the Opencard chip card and the previously paid bonus will be charged only on it.
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, on bypass trains and bus lines from the 300 to 499 numbers used mainly by the inhabitants of the towns of Central Bohemia.
"On trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reading card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the bonus area," explained the control of the tickets, Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization that sets the hours of the collective transport of Prague.
Bypass buses have their reader cards mounted on the driver's locker.
Upon entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but it is also necessary to accompany it with the Opencard in the place destined for it on the side of the Fund.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the vouchers there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal said.
Passengers who do not travel on bypass buses and do not remember when the validity of the bonus ends can go to vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown the information about the validity of your document.
Southeasts wanted to join the US in a referendum
The German Sudetes asked in 1945 that Sumaba be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this desire, some groups of Germans from Sudeten were supposedly addressed to the president of the United States in 1945.
It results from the letters that are stored in a particular archive that are now stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Krumlov ask in a letter to the American President not to allow the return of the "Eumava land" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and really want his word that American units are reaching German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators," the letter is written, signed with a "people who carry the fate of Eumava in their heart."
Since Czechoslovakia's union with south-eastern Germans presumably implies - according to them Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, inconsideration, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors plead in the letter to the American president to assume for today and forever Eumava under a protectorate.
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants, it will give us a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that it does not cooperate with the victory of the allies at all," the letter is written.
The reason the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals from "Czech opponents."
If the president of the United States presumably hesitated about this idea of the Germans, it would be enough to organize in the lands Eumavas a referendum on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the US or live under their patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of post-war history, may sound a little childish to us, according to some specialists rightly paints the expectations of the Germans in the south-east.
Although the Czech Germans had to intuit minimally that only a few would be treated about their expulsion from the republic.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate for the Sudetes some clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they'd stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed even by Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in Eeské Budjovice.
He was in the war, as a German of Budjovice, enlisted in the Baltic navy.
When he was arrested by the British at the end of the war and placed in the Holstein prison camp dozens of Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought that when they came home, they could use it," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, was that on the basis of the Benes' Decrees they would be removed from the Republic.
You don't think.
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could characterize the emotional campaign that the Ministry of Transport decided to launch on Wednesday in the media.
The minister's office, Ale,ebí-ek promises that it will deter drivers from dangerous conduct at the wheel.
The $150 million campaign will be felt on television, radio, cinema, the internet and in brochures.
It would have to deter the driver from high speed and the alcohol behind the wheel.
And also to remind them that before they start their belts, they stick their belts.
He wants to get to the awareness of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and ultimately also professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories that stunt emotions.
And for this we are attested to by the "bloody" ads throughout the campaign:
You don't think.
The word "You don't think" is written with big letters on the plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pays".
This should symbolize that man in a moment of goodbye can pay with his own life.
The ads will "fear" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
It promises that this will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been produced by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and whip for drivers
"For drivers, the sugar and whip system is worth it.
Sugar is for him when, for example, he passes a red light and thus saves time.
The whip is a threat of a fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks," says the transport psychologist at the Na Homolce hospital, Martin Koan.
And that is why it is necessary to provide an information campaign in the press and mainly negative publicity, the psychologist specifies.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is any installed panel warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," Kosan warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The president of Israel's interim government, Ehud Olmert, spoke about the restitution of virtually all the land occupied in 1967, i.e. the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He said in the interview that on Monday he appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we will necessarily have to restore almost all (occupied) land if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"I'm sure we'll keep a bit of these lands, but we Palestinians will have to give them a hundredths like (from Israel's lands) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that in case of restitution East Jerusalem would also be included.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore doesn't want tractors or bulldozers to pass over his legs as happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to hand over a part of Jerusalem," Olmert said, referring to the two July attacks in the city in which several dead and dozens of people were injured.
According to the president it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the hill of the Temple, sacred and historical place" located inside the old city.
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he insisted later.
Withdrawal of the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out about Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an inherent condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also be concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to close the peace with Syria only at the base of the Golan withdrawal," he warned.
"Syrians know well what they will have to give up to win the Golan.
They must abandon their current relations with Iran, they must abandon their relations with the Hezbollah (Chinese movement), they must detach themselves from the permanent support caused by Hamas (the Shit Movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India may cool
If the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting beetles could not be solved, a cooling of Czech-Indian relations could be found, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This is what the minister said in New York, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this was not resolved then yes, then this cooling would surely be reached," he said after the meeting that was organized on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the meeting that the executive can hardly get involved in legal matters.
However, he said that in the case of Petr Evacha, who was exempt from prosecution and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kuaera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest levels.
He can then apply for the exoneration of the case and waited at free for the sentence, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself on the same terms during the meeting.
"He advises appealing to the High Court and then a pardon would be possible," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way in which the Czech side can get into the matter is to get the convicted person a "legal competent support," the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such a kind of support is already obtained by the Indian part.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining with India the best relationships, which have a long tradition.
The Indians recognize him too," Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as the TK said, he insisted to his colleague that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really consider it a tremendous mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists," he announced.
The minister evaded the answer to the question of whether he received from the Indian side the promise that he would deal with the matter.
"I've received quite a few promises," he said.
Questions after the accident: Are stewardesses illegal on buses?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-haul bus
In connection with the tragic accident of the company Student Agency bus near the Italian city of Padova, we are asked whether stewardesses and passengers can get around the bus during the journey.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the stewardess is opposed to the road traffic law," says Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The crash in which the 22-year-old stewardess died last week was evidently caused by the truck driver only that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the least safe place of the vehicle despite having two other sites booked.
However, the bus can have an accident or brake suddenly, and at the very moment when the stewardess distributes the coffee or the newspapers.
Here what plays the role is whether the bus is endowed, according to the technical permit, with walking places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
The long distance buses of Student Agency do not have places to go standing, which confirmed the company's director, Radim Jansura, to Aktuáln.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally this was removed and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is on track if they have a seat," he told us.
The stewardess doesn't know the law
"There is no obvious legal interpretation of the role of the stewardess - no legal provision clarifies this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term Vehicle Reviewer, whose rights and obligations are not defined," adds spokesman Hanzelka, less sharply.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorn, believes, on the contrary, that the law sufficiently addresses this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have foot sites.
That's it," he says.
Buses are divided between urban ones, where there are places to be standing and at limited maximum speed, interurban with places to be standing with a higher speed permit and those of long distances without places to go standing, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on the plane, says the expert
BESIP's expert on Transport Safety, Jaroslav Hosín, does not see major problems in terms of the movement of the flight attendant on the bus.
"During the course of the journey there is not much danger threat, the situation can be compared to service on planes.
Even here is not sure that the turbulence will arrive and that the stewardess can be hit on the head."
"However, if the bus suddenly brakes suddenly that physical laws are valid.
Same as on an urban bus or on the tram.
The safety of the stewardess must be solved by the internal regulations of the carrier," he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unresolved.
Janura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier to offer the stewardess service.
Use in it two hundred.
The director, not after the accident, considers that job risky.
"However, at the moment I get the impression that the stewardess post is risky, then I will suppress it.
The cafe and newspapers can receive it, the passengers, when they enter.
I would save even expenses," he says.
In the interests of safety, it's why Asiana lacks stewardesses in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
"We don't have stewardesses, we're against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident," he said less than a year ago for T.den.cz.
A huge tragedy happened
A young Pilsen flight attendant who had worked for the company for two years died in the crash of the line linking Naples.
A Slovenian truck that probably swung from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus without using the intermittents.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid it, however, he collided with the front right.
Janura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the stewardess' rest were sold.
"These sites are not possible to book them for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency won't wait for the verdict of the trial on compensation for the girl's family but expects financial expenses also from the culprit's part.
Reform of the law?
No, for now.
The reform of the law could bring greater precision on the movement of the flight attendant on the bus in which thirty experts from a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working for a year.
"However, they have not reached any concrete conclusion.
They are not too dedicated to buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile during the march," says expert Hosín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewardesses something that significantly threatens passenger safety," concluded spokesman Hanzelka, that control of safety on buses is the responsibility of the police and the Safety Bureau at work.
A Czech arbitrates a fight on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, in which Australia is depicted surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but a small missing point in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed around it.
The region is, at the same time, as big as a single continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the 30-member team working in the UN Division for Ocean Law and Sea Affairs.
Its chief, director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
He governs this mood and enthusiasm for work.
The seabed hides to this day a little-known world, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms to date that bear the key to the development of anticancer drugs.
The bottom is larger than the mainland
Countries with coasts have today begun to vehemently dispute the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is mainly the so-called continental bank which sometimes extends a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
It has exclusive rights under the Treaty in all the resources of the mainland bank.
"Simply put, continental Borde means the part of the seabed and its surface, which is a natural continuation of the continent underwater.
It reaches the seashore, and often, to the border of 200 nautical miles, i.e. pure economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by the given country to the Commission, for the delimitation of the outer limits of the continent's Edge, must be delivered with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of preparation of work.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal specialist aid commission.
The commission has so far processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have gone ahead," Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia's success had a global impact as it was the first to essentially expand its marine dominance.
But it was also achieved by New Zealand - the seabed surface granted to it by the commission last week is 1.6 million square kilometres, or almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of pains for their study.
The gain that will come from the use of the seabed will be, as promised, invaluable.
Other states are also gradually submitting their applications.
They can do so until ten years from the time they ratified the "Treaty of Montego Bay."
Where the continental bank ends, the region of the ocean floor declared by the Treaty as "common inheritance of humanity" begins.
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is not any gold mine," says director Mikulka, adding "that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its contract-defined regime."
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed belongs to the Czech Republic as well.
It is distributed with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal."
This was achieved in 1991 with a treaty as investors as well as few other states, states called "the pioneering investor."
It has the power to explode in the ClarionClipperton area of the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is rugged, it's something of a sea replica of the Tatras.
"An area of a total area of 75,000 square kilometres can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian Division employee, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concretion.
It reminds us of a little potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived Golem.
Dusseldorf's hope rests on Frankfurt
The West LB bank's board letter for its collaborators is not lacking in big words.
Due to the merger of the units of the bank of Dusseldorf with the DEKA bank, a central capital market of the financial group of Sparkassen's financial group can be formed, as the letter, published on Monday
The West LB bank, breaking the competition bull' with sustainable profit capacity, would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger may be a start for subsequent mergers in the field of regional banks.
This is how the text comes to understand, when a board of directors wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because as before the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also of the federal financial services monitoring institute that has recently made it clear to the government of the North Rhine-Westphalia that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also from the Frankfurt side, there has been a lot of talk about the union of such a kind between DEKA bank, that Sparkasse's clients know about their investment funds, and the West LB.
Indeed, Franz Waas, the head of DEKA Bank, presenting the data after a half year at the end of August, let it be known that he sees no sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Strasse Street, with a regional bank such as the Helaba or the West LB.
But the board of directors of DEKA, which is now composed of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, commissioned the board to begin negotiations with the West LB on common business activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, so it is said on the financial site.
This is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the area of Sparkassen, the name of the DEKA bank appears, which with its 3000 collaborators is the most important entrepreneurs on the financial site Francfort.
In 2003 at one point the situation seemed so that DEKA Bank could merge with the Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank and the Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was left without results.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hesse government expressed itself against the participation of the Helabe in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of the Rhineland-Palatinate began the dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Werttemberg.
But the idea of merging DEKA bank with other regional banks was always played again.
But finally, the chairman of the Helaba board of directors said he was against the plans for coexistence with his bank.
Rewistingly, it seems to be clearer that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
Well, when the Bavarian parliament elections are to pass, BayernLB's union with the Baden-Werttemberg regional bank could make progress.
For the Helabe that is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to merge will increase, Helaba will lack partners to do that.
In the south the bank could only be a young partner, although so far it has excelled much better from the financial crisis than did the Stuttgart and Munich properties.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen - a Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 per cent of the Helaba, earlier this year avoided plans to co-existence with the West LB.
In any case, only the Nord LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections are just one part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a key question about a trade model that could secure the future for regional banks, that the deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has so far given no answer.
In the end the West LB can be broken down, but that, of course, is not the bank's own desire.
Thus, also the letter from the bank's board of directors said that an attempt would be made to find a complete solution for the entire bank.
As you can combine coexistence between unique parts of the bank with DEKA, that will show the time.
Oktoberfest's second weekend is known as "Italian weekend"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth.
But this time, Elena is attended by as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-litre barrel of Kaiser-branded beer is built a huge bear tiger that shows nearly 200 Oktoberfest participants who are low-sound sounds can produce in his throat.
First Elena pats Luca, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 23:45 three buses leave, and Munich address the beer party', expected arrival at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are planned mainly for the Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to their flag are singing the South Americans, they had already started celebrating at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for the Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver colored legs, belong to these buses.
For five years they have been coming to the Oktoberfest, considering that only this year alone there are three excursions.
At night on the road there, during the day in the meadow, at 22.30 a.m. on the way back.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including welcoming reception with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the law of the purity of Bavaria, health insurance and the guide in German-Mark attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the direction "Brennero"
No beer, not yet.
Quickly the tranquility reigns on the bus, commuters are sleeping.
That's fine, they'll still need the strength.
It stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian registration make another break on Highway 8 shortly before Munich.
Finally, when Marco's group has the scheduled arrival at 6.30am in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left is written "Oktoberfest," next to Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it."
Second: "When the doors of the tent open, that means "shocking," Marco shouts in the early morning.
"March". March and occupy the backs in the tent.
"Don't take the places in front, because we're going to block, and everyone with yellow caps don't sit on the same bench, spread out of every space."
One litre of beer, Marco roars, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people we have a good tone.
He barely leaves his place, he will be busy."
Third: "This afternoon exactly at 10:30, you have to get here." Have you understood?
And now everyone's going to the Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, tie the yellow caps on the trees, traffic signs and even on an election sign of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be able to recognize the way back.
It's Oktoberfest's second weekend known as "Italian weekend"
There is no exact data on the number of people; it is 50,000 people who make the journey over the Alps and stormily enter the tents, 10 per cent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police receive help from seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross who make a statistic of the nations present, where Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (about 60 assists) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The favorite Italians' campaign tent is so called Hofbruzelt.
Sleeping nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
Germany's banking system is relatively stable, federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrack stressed only last week.
Well, the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German banking sphere will also be affected by critical trends.
And that's happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), Munich's real estate financier, which is listed in the DAX index, receives a $1 billion credit from a consortium of German banks to resist turbulence in the market.
On Monday, a person familiar with the situation told Reuters: credit aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The part of the capital that the Real Estate Hypo is going to use has to throw interest.
The money comes from private banks also from those of public law.
The cause of that is the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
According to one report, state financiers with the money that was borrowed for long-term projects funded them only for a short period - which now, because of distrust in the markets, is no more possible.
In the first half of the year the bank's capital reserve in cash has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the share of equity fell a little from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, continued financial investment income and net profits from financial operations fell to zero, imputation revenue for debtors and some securities also those of the dissolution of provisions of credit businesses fell by more than 70 per cent, by 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the highs and many revenue from the repayments of the compensation costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as the reimbursement of interest under the federal tax code and organized businesses for the consortium companies, the negative balance could lead to a deficit of about 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990 the former state financier was initially lost in speculation with industrial loans for the properties, which served as a reason for the foundation of the Aareal bank.
As much money could not be made from the financing of state projects, Defa began to devote intensively to infrastructure projects and the financing of community projects by private investors and as well as state-owned "Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Real Estate has to make amortisations about the value of the subsidiary that will have a "essential material effect" on the group's consolidated profit and loss account, it is said to be very vaguely.
It's a fact they've cancelled dividends.
By 2007 they were cancelled at two-thirds.
After the acquisition of the Depfa the Hypo Real Estate became a major state and financial financier in the area of infrastructure.
Since the bank does not own the client deposits, he, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans fell essentially because banks were saving their liquidity.
Each year the Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to fund a portion of the Defa's credit portfolios of its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers with a credit the need for the group's financing for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of international money markets that are now essentially not fit to function"
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the chairman of the board of directors of the Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the federal financial services watchdog (BaFin) institute are based on the premise that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group from now on is assured.
That's what the bank's shareholders and creditors have to wait.
But because of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis there is no record.
It is even imaginable that there is no need for funding in its full volume.
But the opposite case cannot be excluded.
The word was that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost in insolvency, so temporary salvation cannot be reassured by at least concerned people either.
The share price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Borrowing courses, on the other hand, are really fine.
While priority debts hardly change, borrowing courses according to the position in the ownership register clearly tend to decline.
Affected are mainly the borrowings of the former subsidiary W.rttemberg Hypo and with the reason the loans whose maturities exceed 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculation must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While issuing banks, governments and banks that are little affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime you can start from pension repayment within the deadline.
Or something is going to happen, which no one risks imagining - the financial crisis is going to overcome in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-mouth news of partial statization, now the security that is already at its limit became a justified hope.
That's going to be a reason, because creditors will spend the night without sleeping, breaking their heads about the decision about their isolation of enthusiasm.
Even short-term investors can put the end and use the transport on new account of losses for upcoming profit-compensation tax payments on the change in the future.
During the hostages' release, the German special forces command was at the scene of action
To resolve the hostage crisis, Egypt's government had asked for German help - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are being known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior in the salvation action, the German special forces also participated indirectly.
Therefore, at the release site were German army specialists as well as GSG 9 officials, a federal police plane squad, the Federal Criminal Investigation Office also experts in the logistics field of the technical charity.
As ministry spokesmen reported on Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
Egypt's government accepted Germany's help to use it as support on the spot.
"Fortunately that time was not there," a spokesman for the Federal Interior Ministry said.
On 19 September in southern Egypt, the assailants had kidnapped a group of travelers made up of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions.
After the abduction in the desert region of southern Egypt, the hostages were deported back to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers became unknown until the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, the safe and saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the liberated hostages were under the tutelage of the German embassy.
He did not say a word on the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information on their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild," five tourists and special forces have to return on Airbus from the German air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bent?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at Tachibana High School the girls started laughing: The German is totally "kawaii."
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of mangas - in a report on the exchanges she tells Japan.
"The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
I was scared before I went to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and go by train 40 minutes to High School Tachibana.
Alone had to find the way, luckily I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not fixed as rigorously as in my house, in Lower Saxony.
From eight o'clock in the morning the students come, at nine minus twenty a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room' begins.
Before the class started, I had been up to introduce myself.
Besides, I'm not a person who speaks with gusto in the public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform, I wore an old skirt from my host family's mother and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, so dressed I put myself in the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything in the right way: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...." - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At the moment I was very happy because for two years I had started studying this language.
All 31 girls in the class have whispered, laughed and made signs and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my mangas.
That belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "monkey, cute"
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong rang, I felt really mugged.
Everyone spoke at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions - at the same time it's very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then at recess everyone pulled out their Bentos.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something other than boring pieces of German bread.
He had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and something like tofu dough meat.
In most cases I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
Things are weird and have a new flavor.
What's certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of plums marinated in the salt, bufff.
In Japanese schools, bentos are not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a bento made in very artistic mode for a boy and gives it to him in the hope of being able to know him better during a recess.
About that I read in my Manga-Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see him here too.
"Why exactly Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always replied:
"Well, because I'm fascinated. "
Finally, I've preferred to read Mangas for years.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I started studying a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I'm going to travel there.
Also because I have a skinny one by tradition and customs.
They have great value here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a severe, disciplined and traditional country.
Since everything is well organized, I still didn't feel lost here although Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life.'
U.S. House of Representatives Doesn't Passage Package
The first chamber of the United States Congress has failed with a small $700 billion large bail package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell very drastically.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's package to save financial markets with 227 votes to 206.
Despite all calls from President George W. Bush and former politicians from both parties failed to reach a majority for the program with which the mess in financial markets should be limited.
With dramatic action, desperate advocates had still tried to convince critics to accept the large $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations, had asked MPs to hold a vote although the plan is not as popular.
"It is difficult to receive political approval to avoid something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
Already during the vote, the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that was investors' concerns that the state salvage package could fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts have other severe turbulence in international financial markets.
To allow the program to enter into force it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Rats also have feelings
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling the danger flees, why has he also been afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology, is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can you control whether they, behaving in the way we do, feel the same way?
In an internet magazine called "Edge" for many years, the contributions of famous scientists are published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the chosen answers to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or someone else being able to prove it so far, although we can't even prove that other people have conscience.
But in this case we can at least wait for it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about sensation and in general about consciousness, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware doesn't match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as other animals: it becomes the dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in similar mode, from which some scientists make conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
I certainly don't think so.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to spread our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include the human consciousness circuits associated with the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of its participation in short memory and executive functions that direct behavior).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of people than that of the other primates and seems to be absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects of our consciousness that depends on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man differs from the other primates.
Another particularity is found in man's linguistic nature: Since most of his experience is united with the tongue, often that means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
But even if consciousness would not depend on the tongue, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created at any hand, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That's why it's hard to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not measured because it has the special hardware, nor is it allowed to analyze it through our experiences, so your research presents us with big problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of the conspicuous experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
Animal awareness processes could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during the short memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essentials pass rather to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to causal mechanisms: The two may be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what results from that for the sensations?
I owe to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for that, the same as with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind in which we are when brain activity occupies a space in the defense system (or its consequences such as body reactions).
Given this point of view, the sensations are very fixed to some of the cerebral cortex which distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature, classifications of fine sensations are still classifieds because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar in order to be able to describe the states of others pairing ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damascus, on the contrary, thinks that sensations stem from the simple activities of the cerebral cortex parts responsible for body feelings and the brain stem, so does Jaak Pankseep thinks, but concentrates more on the trunk.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer absolutely to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I can't go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel like fear, possibly that sits in two cases as well: But how can it be controlled if rats and men behave in such a way do they feel the same?
Seeing the danger a cockroach runs away, then because he's afraid?
I am of the opinion that the likeness of the behavior still does not prove the likeness of experience.
That's true that the neural comparison helps: rats and men have similar ketphane trunks, cockroaches instead have no at least one brain.
Is it the trunk of the brain that is responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: How can you prove it in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their feelings are supposedly distinguished from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here as long as the same of rats and men is measured.
Since I don't investigate the language and conscience of rats, as well as sensations, I don't know if they exist.
You can say I don't see beyond my noses, but I prefer to move forward than to work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA Platini President: grace deadline for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister, said preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
"The government looks at UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as the test of confidence in Ukraine's ability to host the European championship alongside Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But that is not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to start and in both countries there is much to do."
The construction and reconstruction schedule of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is lame.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to do high-speed work," said the president of a Ukraine Grigorij Surkis association.
" UEFA is not going to take our eyes off us."
In Poland, a more radical step was agreed.
After numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The commission met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that PZPN is not able to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we have assured UEFA President Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European championship will not suffer from that."
In the last season alone many clubs in the first division were convicted of manipulation in decline to lower category, eventually the division board had to be postponed.
Organizers record an increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, sales volume of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year - even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened situation, the Germans' desire to travel remains as before.
As the German travel association (DVR) in Berlin reported on Monday, with travel bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent more compared to the same period last year.
According to research by the GfK market research institute, stocks for the autumn months had already risen in number.
Thus the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost 11 percent more compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results are GfK figures that are the information analyzed on the reservations at 1200 travel agencies and roughly computerized for the entire market.
The data collected are travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Because of the weakened course of the dollar, especially travel to the United States is in high demand, the DRV reported.
In this case the number of reservations increased to almost a third.
The Germans' preferred destination points are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Above all, organized trips are highly preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case travel costs are "better calculated for the customer than during an individual trip."
Among other things, consumers can save money with pre-booking discounts or All-Inclusive deals, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months, travel was well booked, so sales volume compared to last year again rose - although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip, compared last year, fell.
Dennis Quaid's counterattack outraged
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about private life - and has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan named her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and counterattacks.
The late war of the two roses in Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid's ex-partner: eight years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan, he first spoke about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis was long unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of a marriage's failure is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to him as an unfaithful husband was clear: "Iudite that Meg tells the stories of our relationship in another version," the 54-year-old man told "New York Daily News."
Among other things, it is very "regrettable" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, will again "remember the pain and changes in public, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is again married and recently is the father of twins.
And so he ends with his statements highlighting: "Whatever my life is, it continues.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that is fine.'
Prices for airline and hotel tickets are dropping
In the first half of 2008, airline tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year's.
According to a current study, airline tickets in Germany were made cheap even as much as 50 percent.
Plane tickets and overnight stays in hotels were again made cheap - these are the results of an American Express travel service provider and financial services.
The company has analyzed its first half-year booking data and after price growth in the first quarter found a big change in the second half.
After prices in the hotel market continued to rise for many years, overnight stays in many places became cheap.
Compared to last year, prices in 41 of Europe's 48 different cities rose on average to 6.9 per cent between January and March.
From April to June, prices were already down to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
The trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar course, which was the cause of "the interests of American tourists in traveling."
The decline in hotel prices is also much more noticeable in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than at industrial concentration points such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent and thus beat a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, airline ticket prices also showed upward trends:
As a result of rising kerosene prices, airline class travelers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights even became more expensive to 29.2 percent.
Prices for airline-class airline tickets, compared with the previous quarter, fell on average to 12.5 per cent, but price changes for Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany, the price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February, prices rose to 11.9, in the second half fell to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even halved.
The cause of the price change is on one side the rise of the loose economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the travel market with the plane demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes aircraft traffic between the US and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of flights of non-profit distances on airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - in Europe alone there were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes the leader.
Borussia's Luhukay is yet to go out to score the first goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented the forced landing of national team player Marko Martin well.
The Gladbach player started playing late and failed to score a goal.
Everything he wanted to say exactly by reacting to what happened could be clearly read from his lips.
I just knew you were right.
"We need a second goal," whistle Hermann Rieger at the booth entrance of Hamburg Stadium.
I don't have anything special in the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of those present were back in their places.
Rieger was for almost three decades physiotherapist at HSV, enjoys a very great reputation as one of those who was part of the group.
That's why his request was noticed from a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded with his head and raised his fingers in a sign of nod.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the head coach of Hamburg.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal.
But that wasn't done.
"Today it wasn't all nice to see," Marcell Jansen added later.
Bastian Reinhard had also wished to have him "more relaxed."
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) for his head impact; and also the situation that Gladbach's team very weak could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"That was a dirty victory," Martin Jol said, summoning.
This Monday the SV of Hamburg is going to turn 121.
On Saturday it will be the spectators had already celebrated their own, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of board on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it," Marcell Jansen said.
He predicts that the partial ratings of the table correspond more to the league's vanity than to the dominance of his HSV.
The team-up with their late forced players such as Brazilians Neves and Silva, scorer Petric as well as Jansen who was taken from FC Bayern need time to get together, but the team can still not shine with their successes.
"We need more of the feeling and dribbling," demands Jol.
My first Oktoberfest
The hits of the parties under the open sky at the endless spa, the one-litre jar beer and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A debut in a tent.
Really Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She's blonde, the moderator on TV and wears a traditional bespoke Bavarian outfit.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is already worn.
But there's one thing that unites us: we're barely in the tent, the photographers have already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it's very liser about everything because I'm at Oktoberfest first.
That's how he becomes friends.
The traditional cheap Bavarian costume seems to play its part.
Actually as a tourist at the Oktoberfest from northern Germany my feeling of well-being in a traditional Bavarian costume to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at Teresa's Prado everything isn't so much.
Almost everyone wears the traditional Bavarian suit or leather trousers; none seems to be listening or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets weird looks next to a banana stand in the chocolate.
A muniquesa draws my attention to my apron that had dressed in the wrong way: "The left part is single, half is the virgin, on the right side it is compromised, behind it is a widow. "
Or God, I buckle from behind to the left now.
"It's okay," he says, laughing.
The others don't care about many of the subtle methods of flirting and wearing caps where "To drink to get dressed" is written and show, without asking them, their ass knot.
A young boy who behaves in exhibitionist way is called Bob, he's from England and is also for the first time at the Oktoberfest.
He seems "gorgeous," which he pronounces with a very long "o."
He tells me after he put his glass of a litre of beer next to him that he just drank.
He put it straight at the side of the firehouse, most think that's a garbage bin.
So Bob is one of the famous people who know how to drink a lot.
The others aren't very lucky and can't consume so much alcohol.
At about eight o'clock at night health groups run around the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
Healthcare workers appear every time in a group - suddenly there are always four people who bring the walks covered from one tent to the next.
That works as with most visitors: They arrive sober, they come back drunk.
You don't see who suffers from alcohol levels and is on the walks.
"They're the ones who "can't be any longer," a toilet answered my question and disappeared in tumult.
After the defeat of the vote
Fear spreads on Wall Street.
Early news of the failure of the banks' salvation package dropped a certain period of Down Jones to 700 points.
That was the biggest one-day loss of the major points in its history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little.
At about 20:30, one of the most important bag barometers in the world quoted a deficit of 5 percent at 10.579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and was 1548 points higher.
At the moment the biggest loser in the Dow Jones was American Express losing nearly 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of nearly 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
Shares of Goldmann Sachs bank lost nearly 10 percent.
Only a few days ago a big investor Warren Buffet had been financially involved in the company.
The salvation plan envisages making available resources to buy so-called "candid" mortgage shares.
But the sum is going to be paid by hit but step by step.
As compensation for that, the state has to receive stock option receipts for financial associations that during course development can be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state's cash.
Action courses in Europe and the US continue to fall
One billion aid for banks in Europe and the US does not reassure investors.
The course of the shares of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate goes down and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the state's projected financial market salvation, the US index Dow Jones continues to fall.
Losses of the speculated shares of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the fall of the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite salvage stocks from the federal government and private banks, the stock of Munich's property finance a period of time lost two-thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6000 points and quoted a deficit of 3.7 percent at 5,839 units.
Around the world, financial markets suffered a fall.
The opening of Wall Street Day in New York began with notable losses.
Investors fear the $700 billion bail package from the U.S. government will not be enough to give boosts to financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening, the Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the Salvation Bill, the Senate vote could be October 1.
The other European balls were also only one trend: at first the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei main index after profit fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 units.
In Hongkong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the Sensex main index lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, and closed at 12,595.75 units.
After the capital increase, Arcandor's shares lost in the MDax.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourism consortium announced that the stakes in Thoms Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years a mysterious phenomenon has caused the bewilderment of researchers: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity may not be so correct.
The "Ulysses" space probe spent nearly 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing now he is threatening a death in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver causes bewilderment among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of the space probes during which they gain an acceleration using the energy of a planet's gravitational field, for example Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical stunt as did the Ulysses Sun probe.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles don't behave 100 percent as expected under the venerable gravitation law.
Rather, they frequent speed irregularities.
Probably the probes have more or less speed.
Physicists could not explain this effect until now.
They called it the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity that describes the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study, now solemnly believes as before Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what astronomers remained in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly may be Dark Matter that can also be very close to Earth," he writes.
The universe's researchers have known the existence of Dark Matter only since ten years.
She allegedly possesses the force of attraction and her influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially also any visible light.
According to scientists' calculations Dark Matter makes at least a fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As Italy's foreign minister confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
Sudan's kidnappers had demanded millions from the ransom.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during the release.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the bailout have already begun.
The Germans always fall back into the kidnappers' point of attention.
The WELT ONLINE newspaper tells of the most important cases.
Apparently European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are free.
On that, the same information is presented by Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Following news of the release on Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian foreign minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are freed.
'Now we're in check on his health,' Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are fine and are in security, Egyptian state television reports.
The 19 participants of the expedition in the desert are on the way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the hostages were released: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They were in agreement with the ransom," the guard said.
It was only about "receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and two of them have been arrested in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded from Germany the ransom in the amount of six million euros; the money had to be delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom," referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after receiving the ransom.
The men had to be held until the kidnappers had a safe route to flee.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take the position on this report.
Victim of crash identified by police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road, in the town of Brentwood, was involved in the crash which happened on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the crash, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released on bail.
String abuse 'taken suicide'
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led to a woman killing herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight counts of indecent assault.
The Trump Royal Court, through an inquest study, found that he had regularly tied up his daughter Stephanie Randle when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confessional role: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court heard that Ms Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her up and blindfold her before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
Her stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court heard that Ms Randle, who spent much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse she had been inflicted twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court what some of Ms Rande's friends had said about her, which, after being a great surfer and cyclist, now seemed "emotionally dead," as if she had "resigned to life."
In April 2007 his real father, Terrace Randle, found the woman dead in his Plymouth apartment.
Ms Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating herself by a plastic bag.
Mr Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that concluded, saying: "I used to tie her up and sell her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: 'You're a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a horrific experience, especially when he was just seven.
This nasty saga ends up with the victim taking his own life.
More clearly, if she hadn't, the issue probably wouldn't have ended up in court.'
He added: 'I've noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother the abuse had been on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future.'
An officer charged over data loss
The BBC has been informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June is to be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a work trip by the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on the train for Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to police.
Surely this is the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of the intention to commit a crime.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought this was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause referring to the safeguarding of the information.
The Royal Juridian Service said the officer should be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work on the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about Al Qaeda and the capacity of security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and immediately moved from his home to a secret location.
Construction companies face B&B price
In Britain, building societies could face a price tag of more than 80,000 pounds after the bailout/save of Bradford and Bingley bank.
The Government did indeed provide 14 billion pounds to protect deposits from the bank's 2.6 million savers.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use savers' money, including 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers it "humiliating" that companies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the $14 billion loan should be repaid after Bradford and Bingley's mortgages are redeemed.
However, the interests that acquies are assumed to be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humbling that the institutions that behaved prudently ... are called to pay today the price of institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
In other words, each of the companies had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and that mediation companies had to pay about 18 per cent of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will be up to GBP 450 thousand in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover 81,000 pounds to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Construction Societies Commercial Association, told the BBC this situation is unfair.
"It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those who were much less cautious."
According to the BSA, there is no data to indicate the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will need to look at all aspects of this issue in the coming weeks to find out what options are available to protect building societies and their members in the face of what could be a relevant price," Mr Cole added.
The interest accruing in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of interest payable, which can be almost twice as much.
With mutual building companies being organisations and not having shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher lower rates or interest on their savings.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey was a member of the European Union, the European powers nestled the desire to penetrate the interior of this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps into Asia, is one of the most interesting relics of disastrous imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-Renaissance style.
At least, here's what the guides say.
The building is set to time to the end of the platforms and has two towers in front, one for each corner, looking like a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in his complex is a little decadent.
But once the box office is overcame, there's no doubt about what was the company's greatness that this was the westernmost gateway.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railway that was cured to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular Arabs.
Because of the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell low
British rule and when the forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allys out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad for Hyderpasha station too.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources said it was a sabotage.
Since then the station has been down and it was left out of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centers, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is in the government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a new partnership policy.
The Turkish Government has excellent good relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I got on a bunk bed and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, expert in foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a jolt trip, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - a new city, designed to govern a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus
which has raised some suspicion in the West and, especially, in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and "powered cakes" where middle-class managers in business suits - men and women - meet early in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
I brought, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The objective of the party's foreign policy is to re-integrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today he has to look at the same time to the East and West.
This is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
You have to do both.
"But surely at some point," he asked, "Could you be forced to choose? "
"Turkey," he replies, "doesn't want to affront that election."
He then highlights one point that almost all I have spoken to so far had recited almost by heart: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically assemble those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Again to Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleep, my thoughts return to the two German lords, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building, 100 years ago.
How much would you have been surprised to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East would, in large part, be in Turkey's hands today?
And waiting for the terminal the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So there is not much doubt in what continent this fascinating country should claim.
The price of milk rises from five pence per litre
The inhabitants of the Jersey stand will have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that the higher price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pence a litre from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February and followed by research by a consulting firm.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases for their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had risen before February, it was in 2002.
Disclaimed bail to former Bangladesh PM
A Bangladesh court has rejected the bail application for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, saying she could be taken to jail when she returned home.
His defenders said the court did not grant him bail on charges of extortion of 50 million taka ($ 729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was prime minister.
This is one of several corruption allegations in his charge.
His long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country's government, militarily deported, grant him first full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not clear now what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain at large when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will make an appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court order.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail application, arguing that he could not get bail because he was already being treated overseas on parole," his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We are going to lodge an appeal against the Supreme Court order."
Her defenders argued that she needed bail to return home from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to his homeland after 17 October, according to an Awami League leader last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the interim government, backed by the army, took power but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges against them.
Fears for the Polio campaign in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan - says the UN - have not taken advantage of a recent anti-polymyelitis vaccination campaign because of Taliban violence.
The United Nations has carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country last week.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach the children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that would not have attacked or hindered thousands of officials while carrying out the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge to the Competition Commission following a decision that forced the company to reduce its stake in rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been told by the Competition Appeals Tribunal that it will have to reduce its 17.9 per cent stake in ITV below 7.5 per cent.
Earlier, the commission said BSkyB's interests hinder competition and allowed its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its share package in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti Monopoly Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of ITV's stake raised doubts about ITV's independence, and prompted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All including Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB said the force to reduce its package on ITV was unreasonable and was a disproportionate remedy, particularly why, BSkyB said, it would have handed over its voting rights.
New investigation into the assumption of American lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Justice Department's inspector general criticized the actions of administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Produranator General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by fears that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officers questioned during the investigation have lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Grave allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney-General Glenn Bellas said in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine American lawyers were removed from office by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department prompted the decision by suggesting that lawyers had been fired for underperformance.
But it was later learned that lawyers had not been evaluated worse than others, and many observers concluded that the dismissals would be politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the persecution of some Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government
And they can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The subsequent head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure over the dismissals, resigned from his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials did the same.
The Attorney-General's report is highly critical of Mr Gonzales' role in the matter, and underlines how he had a "primary responsibility" for the layoffs, which he "abdicated" from his leadership position and was "notably non-cooperative" in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, Bush's former collaborator, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic of great honor
Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will collect the special prize next week at the ceremony to be held in London, said getting this recognition will be "an honor."
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977.
Coldplay's group is taking the nominations for this year's awards and ranking the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them. "
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal ability like the one used by Meat Loaf.
A nearly two-minute instrumental section opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and became number 15 in the rankings.
However, Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell stayed for about nine years in the rankings and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including a surgical operation for his heart arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps early for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply of service.
But many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-standing local residents, find it hard to pinpoint the location of Extra Place, especially as many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of Primiera Street before I found the Second Street - between the Bowery and the Second Avenue.
This street, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alley more than one active track.
There's no sign.
It's practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has fans.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on Primiera Street
He wants to resurface Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other fans include old-fashioned neighbors who commented that they were enchanted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block past before the buildings are seized.
However, the city's Department of Housing, Preservation and Development, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At the meeting of the Community Committee for the use of land that took place this month, representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring that the street stay in the city, called for a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the Community, said.
"The city is home to very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to possess Extra Place," Ms.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first emerged during this month's meeting
But Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, it didn't necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area," he said, adding that the proposed sale came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Committee for Preservation, confirmed that it was the city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission is to develop property rather than the management of that.
Compared to its most colourful surroundings, those at the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on the story.
Some believe it was named after it in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's grand estate was divided between their children and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, was opened in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment that comes out on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia."
"The environment was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the Ramons manager, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and barrel pieces, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the East Village bourgeoisie, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, even modest as they may be, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare, virtually unchanged piece, a city raja that should be protected.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Regrets: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk of the city's history on Extra Place, published by The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a slightly narrow and dead end, dark also for the day and marked by rusty iron warehouse doors and counter-windows, with old newspapers of weeks blown along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat heals across the back of the street and stood near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and now houses a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle of about 22-oz were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention at Extra Place, but suggested it could be given a clean.
Mr Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in their current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet and disgusting places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates' positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a longtime associate in studies on California and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Effectively calling Hispanic voters is a difficult business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are the example of that.
Mr.'s campaign. Obama notes that "African-Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "mutual transition education" for students-English.
However, the open question for Mr Obama is whether the commitment to bilingual education, which prefers classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in nullifying the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized elementary school in the eastern region of Los Angeles County.
In this school, the vast majority of students are Hispanic and low-income family:
More than a third of the students, many of whom are newly arrived, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 per cent of students in the fourth year have been positively evaluated in the 2008 maths exam
And almost an equally astonishing 93 percent have dominated the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street School emphasises review and practice, constant evaluation of skills and does not tolerate any excuses.
Plus, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the Sixth Street main, the school's focus on teaching English to students is in "total immersion."
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We have had extraordinary successes with students like the latter who has arrived from Mexico and that, if you enter the classroom 12 months later you would not be able to pick up what it was."
"It works," he said, "we believe it works."
Will Mr Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model of replicating for other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubts about the answer, but the idea of his party's politicians on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been advocates for bilingual education) and their very continued support for dark bilingual education predicted Mr Obama's response.
While immigrants should learn English, Mr Obama has recently trivialised the issue by letting people stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English
And instead, he said, "you must make sure your child can speak Spanish."
Yes, Mr. Obama wants to improve the system and close loopholes, he should carefully consider the models of education that work well, rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil price falls sharply after renewed economic fears
The price of oil fell sharply on Monday because of concerns that the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to revive the economy.
Shares of crude oil fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has fallen by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by the financial crisis on Wall Street and a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After hitting a high of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to almost $90 per barrel earlier this month, before regressing, again, because of huge uncertainty in financial markets.
The anxiety took hold of investors, again, on Monday, despite congressional leaders who said they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the bailout plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the Wachovia Corporation's banking operations, according to what the government said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, at the frantic weekend, negotiations leading up to the bailout deal "appear not to have been able to revive market sentiment."
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected to fall in demand for commodities, including oil.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rate and exchange rates are going to be increasingly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From the product perspective, our most pressing concern is the assessment of whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China. "
Analysts at the bank have lowered their expectations for next year, as oil consumption drops due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast for a 20 percent reduction in the price of oil and gas by 2009.
Second quarter craze: team sets record
Having spent the past eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Jets uniform, playing in defence, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he saw things unfold in the second quarter on Sunday, when the Jets transformed a scoreless game into a game of deflating.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter started after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played lazily under the gloomy clouds.
At this point, quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles making a 12-yard goal and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon, in which the evolving relationship between the players had a big leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the fourth, one of those when a cornerback fell and another came with 10 seconds left in the half.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps going to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, no matter what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were in the prey, the Cardinals' defense mistreated quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith scored another pass and intercepted him.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced off for missing by Warner.
In the last term, Bowens's faults could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely gave him a 20-yard kick to win a final 34-0.
They're the bigger points the Jets never made in a quarter.
To the team's coach, Eric Mangini, asked him to describe the madness of the moment, he said: "The second quarter or the third quarter? "
When he was answered both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say I liked the second quarter more than the third quarter.
They've won a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Rested Gebrselassie tops its world record
Once again, Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie has proved that many consider him the biggest runner in history, surpassing his own world record in the Berlin marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person capable of running the 26.2 mile race in 2 hours four minutes.
After winning the flat race in 2:03:59, Gebrselasie has shattered his previous record of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the 26th world record in an impressive length race so he has set a world championship or world record for any distance, from the race against the clock to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in hindsight - that air pollution would aggravate his problems with asthma.
Instead, he signed up to run in Berlin.
In virtually perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, employing on average a sharp four minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Kenya's Paul Tergat have converted from long distances, the marathon record has been reduced by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday's win, Gebrselassie told reporters he had suffered calf cramp two weeks earlier and had missed a week of training.
Clearly the suspension left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I dyed some doubts, but in the end it all went well."
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's African-East rival - for the style of orchestrating his career too much, avoiding encounter with many stars of the world marathon, based on pacemakers as if it were a racetrack, and setting the records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselasie's skills as a runner.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half the race in 1:02:04.
Two Kenya's elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began challenging Gebrselassie after their pacemakers dropped.
But just before three miles from the finish line, Gebrselassie picked up a last-gasp drive to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best record by nearly five minutes.
Kamathi came in third place in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Britain's Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She also also failed to take part in the Beijing Games for what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set her best-scoring personal in almost five minutes in the third marathon he ran.
He made a smart calculus race, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to head and then recovering them after 18 1/2 miles.
Ethiopia's Askale Tafa Magarsa won second place in 2:21.31, while Kenya's Elena Kiprop finished third in 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and proof of life of color
Hidden by the expansion of the park to the theme of the great Orlando, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colossal city, there is a quiet town, where pride and complications of the African-American experience become very evident.
Eatonville, the first fully inhabited city of blacks incorporated in the country and place of Zora Neale Hurston's childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guava, two schools and not a prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora. Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Ms. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described - also making it a tourist stage through its inclusion in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers Project of the Depression season - it remains a separate place.
The city stays independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resist sharing their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and doesn't know what he's missing."
Even now, in the year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has drawn attention to starting a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain cautious in front of the outsider.
"We're very cautious about the way our story is told," said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city's oldest church.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
At the same time, a historical model of the affirmation of blacks and a community of nearly 2,400 people living below a poverty rate twice the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the black south - sometimes disdained, others praised - that was born of slavery in America.
No wonder, if those who live here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern for the image of Eatonville really started with Zora, as no one here calls him Mrs Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through downtown Florida often forgotten in the history of blacks and human drama.
Faced with cement in life as well as in literature, Ms Hurston took her readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Out of the road to the left," he wrote, "there's the modern public school mare with its white finishes, its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions widow Dash's new husband and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes out with transient rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Ms Hurston puts Eatonville in an interest with self-government, but also illiteracy, marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as far as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls who immortalised Ms Hurston quoting men who were singing colourless songs about her beauty.
He added: "Some people didn't like that."
Ms. Hurston is still remembered here as an eccentric vivacious who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, is remembered that when Mrs Hurston arrived in the city, she did so without warning in a big Chevrolet, smoking and wearing trousers in a city that still prides herself on dressing with dignity today.
Most residents were left fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," Mr. Franklin.
But, she adds, swinging in her chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Ms Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Ms Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer on print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about it.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary Langston Hughes star and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no major commemorative ceremonies, no major public readings.
"I don't think her contribution to the world or her heritage was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Ms. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the 80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane road through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-lane main labor community street.
The Orlando area expansion had already pushed Interstate 4 across the city's western edge.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to it relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred closer to the community.
"During that season, a group of white guys were going through the city throwing oranges and everything against the people sitting next door," Mr Franklin said.
"They killed a girl, too, once.
They threw him at a watermelon in the car.
In a 1955 letter to Ms. Hurston, he wrote to The Orlando Sentinel newspaper, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted instead of honoring my race."
Residents today say the desegregation of schools, which was positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville's cohesion and undermined the confidence of its young people.
"Black kids were used to being hugged - I remember this, uh, hugging the teacher in the morning and at night," he said. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"I wasn't embracing your teacher because it was white - there's a cultural gap there," Ms Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who went over prejudices, as did she, with buoyant, confidence and lines like: "How can anyone deny yourself the pleasure of my company.
I don't understand.'
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Ms Hurston's anonymous grave and began fighting to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Ms Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroducing it to American canons.
The road project came just as Eatonville's most famous daughter went back under the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Ms. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
"The resurrected idea of the road on five tracks would have been to put in what you would call curvature speed, a real civic pride," Ms Nathiri said.
Mrs Boyd said more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
Victory over the road project has helped change the image of the same city.
Out-of-town people like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began appearing in large numbers, and residents began reviewing the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (carrying Hurston's name, of course) opened in 2006 on a resurrected and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like on a street of the past in a summer rain, in a city as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Strangers who come in search of Eatonville's history, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A Forward permission is needed to do most of the interviews, and some things - like murals in Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - can't be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has a weakness for bright red, still fears her island community may be misinterpreted.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of home pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville just as Ms. Hurston saw all her race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and also to other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, silly and mixed.
It's a sincere civic sense that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in local government or the Police Department, which he said might need some help.
And even those who are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, in case they dare go all the way here, they will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other'," says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stand up and take a moment to look at its story, it's a very nice city."
Over here in New York, everyone talks about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosks and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't notice to find themselves in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the bee-nest-wave offices above their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York face each other daily the worst "bad day of the office" since the 1929 downturn.
Guys for home delivery continue to echo their metal carts for tea across the sidewalks and carry muffinal trays for breakfast meetings.
Latino men continue to crawl between office buildings, as well as human mules, with 50 shirts of eccentric hanging-ups a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers are still waiting in line for their morning takeaway meal, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 a.m. on working days.
Employees still queuing for their bagel to the vendors' carts, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five o'clock in the afternoons of the week.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts there, I have decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time it took for the operation to coincide with the calm of the end of the afternoon at my local JP Morgan Chase subsidiary, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not ahead of the employee's window, to withdraw his cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where lifelong customers order their checkbooks, tourists are looking for instructions to go to Macy's department stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my "trustworthy personal banker," and they were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, they had still withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places from where they had switched them, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money out of so-called savings associations (a little like a construction company), the credit unions and savings banks in their hometown whose boars only operate within the state of belonging, and who claim to treat customers like their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion of assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a ransom buyer.
Office workers and shops who stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the Wall Street ransoms.
Ordinary people in New York have become in recent weeks finance experts.
One woman at my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its distressed-looking chief executive, Dick Fuld, commented on the matter familiarly as if they were complaining about a colleague's inactivity.
And Lyn, and something concierge in uniform from my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my shoppers to the shopkeeper.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The commutation is done, I'm not taking any risks.'
Remembering Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Which Guildford music director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (esquela, September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for the under-21s, but by the time the Proteus sang its final in 1979, several of us were finishing 20 - we just refused to give even the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being who changes the forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, whether mature or Messiaen, indifferent if unaccompanied or with complete orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all due to the inspiration of that man and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Often Tod told us about "letting the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
That's how you just have to sing."
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never tax, or too florid.
Either the musical scarf, it always ended up on an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I met him very well during the two decades in which he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never, for any, have I been disappointed otherwise, I have often been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two well-known warhorses around the world."
We'll miss a lot.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In his sequela of William Woodruff (25 September) you claim that "in 1946 the studies of economic history were resumed in Oxford and in 1950 he won a Houblon-Norman research scholarship... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctoral degree."
This is learned from a note from Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he definitely left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career, he remains unknown.
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria approaches right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of Austria's far-right Freedom Party, and Belgian Filip Dewinter, affiliated with the far-right Vlaams Belang party, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities Against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signs depicting mosques with a red line that crosses.
Police are blaming far-right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right political parties made huge gains in the country's general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at Traun Cemetery, near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organised action.
Criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as David's Star over some of the graves, but investigators believe this may have happened because of the attempt to hide the real motives of hate-driven extremists against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was in any way related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which reached Muslim religious when the month Ramadan was running out.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after the turn to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that took nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led a campaign focused on the anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party that won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burkas, and also expressed opposition to foods considered to be related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing they were symbols of the ongoing Islamisation policy in Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses conducted in the immediate aftermath of the election, which have confirmed the far right as the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that the change came mainly from young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Overseas travel ban for Gary Glitter
Courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sex abuse, from travelling to France and Spain.
Judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the watchdog authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Kent Police issued the ban on overseas travel last Thursday after magistrates produced evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for child sex abuse.
Glitter, a real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, but was represented by lawyer Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, police requested a provision to prevent Mr Paul Gadd's travel abroad as far as France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend in person".
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad, as he was on the sex offenders register.
He has to inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to notify the police of the target date seven days in advance of his departure.
Kent Police said they would not discuss the individual case or Glitter's possible location in the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "Kent Police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "Kent Police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
'From our point of view, it's easier to keep an eye on someone who stays in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all potential risks more effectively.
"Protecting Kent residents is the main concern of Kent Police and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the county and minimise any risks that may exist to the public."
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese jail for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When he was released Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt unwell and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also denied entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he would return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge Magistrates' Court in west London after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been jailed in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of child abuse images.
A Home Office source reported that Jacqui Smith, the interior minister, reassured and was pleased to learn that they had banned Glitter from travelling to France and Spain.
"Captain the teacher off the scene to extract his character" Gonther Bauer-Photographer
Neither heels nor flyers nor premiership suits.
The essence of the great flamenco masters, stripped of concentration in interpretation to obtain the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
Step aside the artist.
The other, the person.
Inseparable except in privacy, in those moments outside the public, when to find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen gaze or the expressiveness of a few hands, carefree because they are not going to go on stage.
The German Gonther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less well-known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different fields.
Included in the programming of the Month of Flamenco Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day," explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "may be any people but, when seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of transmitting passion, sadness, joy on stage... captivating the public.
To capture the personality of these artists you don't have to take pictures of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco."
With the flavor of the festival "Cante de las Minas," Bauer began in 1,997 a long journey to portray the singers, guitarists or dancers with a badge camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, recall classical photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classic basis of the image, conferring modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, that evolves and surprises every day."
It is not the action of dance, singing or touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which captivates with his art to the public.
The search for an encounter with the essentials, with the goblin that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and of being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotomata.
Known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, make up this selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people," the photographer admits that "I love portraying people, meeting them and being able to enter their lives for a moment, whether it's a long or short moment.
I think within photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself or face people, characters, who sometimes don't know, or who leave you just a few minutes to take the picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco entitled "Flamenco-people" is exhibited at the Gallery El Fotómata, located at number 20 of Calle de la Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where it can be visited until October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a recklessness"
It is set in places that he does not yet know and deals with unknown matters, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to carrying out the new project in which he works, a novel that has as its protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The always favorite to the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday in his passage through the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that is occupying him today "is a recklessness" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
"If I were sensible, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I hope to end it once," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thought and words that for four days has seen a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people pass through the Aqueduct city.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the leading figures of the third edition of the word party and fulfilled the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an old edition of Dickens' "Our Mutual Friend" - filled the capacity of the Juan Bravo theater.
Presented by Felix Romeo, he found before him a dedicated audience to which he was made very short of the time when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extrordinary adventure" of the "pleasure of reading" and "living more than he lived"; how he writes of "disciplined way" to fill his "lack of inspiration" with intense documentation work, correcting and redoing a lot; how;Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas influenced their vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which their stories are based.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change their lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more dissatisfied," so he asked the writers "not to abandon themselves to frivolity" and "take responsibility" for his vocation.
The climatology diminishes the fair of Pozoblanco that also runs out of grilles
The celebration of grilles that closed the subscription of the fair of Pozoblanco was suspended yesterday morning, after verifying the rejoneadores announced that the floor of the square was not in the best condition.
In this way, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the cumshot.
The inclement weather has been baited with this fair, as finally two of its three celebrations have not been held.
Saturday was the rain that prevented the celebration of the planned second bullfight.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a lock-up of Castilblanco
So, only on Friday there was a celebration.
In it, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and went out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetic.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante left his two roasts with greetings and an ear, which they granted more the layouts than his bullfighting.
But even worse was El Juli, who passed through the sew of Los Llanos without sorrow or glory.
In his second bull, after a relief work he earned the bronze of a large part of the audience.
They skip a checkpoint in Alava in a van with 2,000 kilos of hashish
Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armiñón (Álava).
The officers stop the two occupants of a van and they are fleeing.
His cargo, more than two tons of hashish, was not enough to stop.
The officers chased them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old male, identified as A. A. J., as reported in a statement by the Basque Government's Department of the Interior.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and forgery of a public document.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the Alava Traffic Unit were carrying out a transport control on the N-1, as they passed through the municipality of Armiñón.
They were preparing to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed the orders, accelerated sharply and skipped control.
The officers began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometers later on the road, when its two occupants went off to flee to the race through a wooded area.
The ertzains finally reached one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with bundles of hashish, and they proceeded to transfer it to police units for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, officials found that the registration had been "doubled" as it did not coincide with the collection in the van documentation, and the arrested person has also been charged with a crime of falsification of a public document.
Ertzaintza continues the investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape the race as has been said, and determine the provenance of the drug seized.
The detainee, A. A. J., 28, was transferred to police units for appropriate proceedings and will be brought before the courts in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the effects of a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the effects of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers as she tried to leave her parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California highway patrol has revealed to People magazine.
The witness has detailed that around 4.30 p.m., Locklear "was stepping on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot back and forth, and when he went back he passed several times over his sunglasses."
Shortly afterwards, the witness, who had apparently not recognized the actress at first, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and left the vehicle.
This person alerted the emergency services because "he was concerned about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She seemed disoriented," so the officers took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the excess alcohol was discarded from the very beginning, although "the officers said at first glance, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medicine."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the effects of any substance that has not been specified and entered the local prison at around 7 p.m. although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where he was recovering from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges IU's Andalusian federation to assume its powers in the Silva case
The general coordinator of IU and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that will have to make a decision on the case of the former councillor of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of making favorable treatment for relatives.
"I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its competences," Llamazares said about the action that the party will have to take with the one councillor so far in the Seville council.
However, the IU leader argued that the need for "transparency" to be present in the possible investigations into the irregularities Silva could have committed: "IU has always advocated that these types of issues have the highest degree of transparency."
In the same vein, he stressed that the training has "strict ethical codes for all public officials."
'May's Blood, Garci's epic bet
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós' National Episodes, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French in Sangre in May, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with about 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a wide cast of performers.
May Blood, with a footage of more than two and a half hours, premieres this Friday in the cinemas, to become in the future a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours duration.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled this film "a dream of childhood," which should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to shoot a commemorative tape for the second centenary of May 2, Madrid, something that he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has provided in its entirety constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to set with the decorations and the appropriate costume the portrait of "an atlondrada Spain who was wrong as boss for fighting, since the struggle for independence led the people to beat enormously late with the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had funding such as Alatriste or Los ghosts de Goya - more than twice that of Sangre in May - so he has not been able to shoot some scenes reflected in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost his entire career.
For this reason, the director of Back to Beginning has insisted on what is his usual form of work, the staging with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting the shooting and those who do not casting, for considering him "humiliating" and considering that "part of the director's trade lies in going to theater and cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works."
Many of the performers with whom he coincides in Sangre de mayo repeat before his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Candidate for the Oscar on four occasions - of which she won one - Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the Blood of May itself, Seven French billiard tables and the finally selected, The blind Sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one that must be made known," she said.
With this film Garci doesn't expect awards.
"In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you settle for making one more film," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Seville dancer Tartola Valencia
A Seville dancer will pay tribute to a Seville dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Floren-Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old she moved to London with her family.
She was a free dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
He had an exciting life, a pioneer of women's liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset that prevented free movement from female.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between wars fascinated Isabel Bayón.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed to me this character and I found it incredible.'
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell her life but to collect her spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested flamenco sticks to me.
Thus, "the dance of the butterfly" suggested to me a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" tangos.
His dance was sensual and I've been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic," he says.
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabel again in one in her shows, as she did in that of "La puerta abierto"; and with teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with who was her student.
"Matilde plays the older Tortola, the character of maturity.
I am happy that I have agreed to perform in my work and I am very honored by it."
The montage also has the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the Flea and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were divas in all its extension, and who are always in love with them."
The work also tells in some way the life of this woman that developed in places so far, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as all over Europe, as she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think it's one of those women who have a huge influence at a certain time and now no one knows and much less values his work," Bayón says.
The show will begin today at 8.30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
J.J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida" because his black and white photographs, documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew my attention for their simplicity and the force they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
The publication of the "Diary of a newly married poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Little-Poeto" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities programmed by the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized in order to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Prize Museum House and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz," which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling through the different Andalusian provinces, is expected to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
In addition, the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Reciencasado Poet," edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and the work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes it less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absence of malice," and gives the idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and from all over America, to the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
Look what a cost them to give him an Oscar.
And I was retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be very ill.
It's still been a dungeon for everyone.
"Sometimes what you feel is beyond all expression, and now I've lost a great friend," Robert Redford cried, "my life and my country were better thanks to their existence."
No one was afraid to make a fool of themselves or exaggerate.
A film and homeland father had died at a particularly dark time, with fear of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When so hard is time and without virtue men and very few beings to admire you have left, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for everyone an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and an advocate of lost and earned causes, from the drug-fighting foundation created in honor of his firstborn on overdose to his homemade and organic food brand.
A gift to a country that has had a hard time overcoming a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of Hollywood sweeping admiration without attending to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that not a man has died but an era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was no more or less than the height of his career.
Australia's bad boy, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his biggest inspiration.
"It has left the bar very high for us all," said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping the requirement of probity high and of having a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once but then he was married to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful when he was surely left over the chances of not being.
"But why am I going to eat burger outside the house, if I have a steak inside?" he used to joke himself.
In heaven he is proud that on earth his daughters coincide with their fans, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, none of whom were as proud as that of devout husband, loving father, solicitous grandfather and dedicated philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that some Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I say no.
The perfect race was called, and in my opinion it's been the worst race with a lot I've been in.
A high of nonsense that, of course, if you were to consider it as an evaluation and I examined, would be a very clear suspense.
But let's go in parts and from the beginning.
The nonsense begins with the collection of the dorsal, which makes you have to go first.
Which doesn't seem bad to me, but if they already make you go to give everything (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well, no.
Here they only made you go to pick up the dorsal (first purpose, go for that only) and (after the relevant tail), surprise, there was only size 'S' for the shirt (second nonsense, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Or have they decided to buy only small T-shirts with fewer fabrics and cheaper from the crisis?
Well, things like this are a minutiae compared to those on race day.
Apart from having to go too early to pick up the chip, the tail when you arrive is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
More than 35 minutes of waiting lasted, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race began and we had not yet left the backpack, although once achieved, the pick-up was worse.
In addition, the rain enlivened the wait of more than 40 minutes, which was joined by conatos de rebellion popular and assault on the booth.
I think about 500 people will surely have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me will not even appear with the right time in the classification, due to the chip they gave me that, I imagine, did not mark my exit correctly.
Of course, if they asked me about the perfect race, this one wouldn't go into my thoughts.
So I think we'll keep dreaming of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft seeks receptionist (virtual)
At the Emerging Technologies Conference at MIT Microsoft has shown a breakthrough in a new human image recognition and interaction system, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company's campus) according to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can tell how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they wear - and listen to and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group those present according to conversation groups.
In the sample video, the receptionist spots a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he is there to visit anyone and tells him that he will attend to him shortly.
All without blue screenshot.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week there has been much talk about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won't have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with what was essential rather than commercially loaded, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
A finding considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and also the software.
When Google Chrome went online, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google's first step in competing with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the Hardware and Software to understand.
Do the same role as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
It's true.
It will never disappear but you have to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People are getting less and less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts only to run the Firefox or the Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are the use of half of the applications that come in the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I'm bringing a small example.
The photo of this post was taken in one of Microsoft's employee rest rooms in Redmond earlier this month.
On the soft drink machine a sign asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by the way, a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also confirmed.
It won't come in early 2009 but in the late, rather pulling to 2010.
At Microsoft they will surely search for the joint launch of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more and more computers.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the street, is going to be billed.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Cote d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', as did Al Pacino in 'The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we start to list stellar appearances, we can go back to the image of that pointy mustache spurt that raised weights in a travelling circus.
In essence, it is only the typical male indoor shirt in cotton, girded and sleeveless.
The 'tank', which the Anglo-speaking Ones call, but le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles emerges above all the others.
First, because of its rhyming name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport because it is named after, according to legend, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out above the others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the most emblematic T-shirt models wear as detail on the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm is not only focused on its top tank.
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, sailor T-shirts, babysitting, mini shorts...
Cloths designed for underwear comfort.
It's a shame, though, to leave them as underwear.
They have too much charm.
Second round for Honda's bestseller
In November Honda will begin marketing the second generation of Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new minivan has an even wider interior space.
Added to this are refined mechanics, which increase the comfort of driving and save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
That's the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz aesthetically presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model, it should be commented that this new Jazz comes six years after introducing the first generation to the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than that used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less well known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, where Jazz has been the most commercialized car in 2002 and also during 2008.
Nearly a million units of Jazz have been sold in Japan since its launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda intends that this new Jazz will allow sales to increase within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm marketed a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009 the estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would mean a 17% growth in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the heads of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to greatly alleviate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, the brand's managers expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units marketed, which is 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a 16 per cent drop.
Despite this increase in Honda sales, it has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to achieve 2 per cent in 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda trusts the arrival of another new model.
It is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact size - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By market and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will occur in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once its presentation is made in society in January in Valencia.
Regarding the first generation, the new Jazz grows at all its heights.
Its length amounts to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between axles up to 2.50 meters, an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and remains at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the inner habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of the central fuel tank, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
In addition, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - amounts to 399 liters, 19 litres more capacity of the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these measures are of the version with engine 1.4, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 trunk is 379 litres.
Other improvements - plus exterior elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear squares.
And the doors that give access to the second row have an 80-degree opening angle, compared to 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Also new engines are in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will have two 1.2 and 1.4 litre gasoline propellants.
Both mechanics incorporate the i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high pair throughout the engine regime.
The first 1.2-litre mechanic gets a power of 90 horses at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. to 4,900 laps.
This propellant - which in previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has an expenditure of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Regarding the previous propellant, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, now it happens to have 100.
This 100-horse jazz achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Today the Cruz sisters take their new fashion activity very seriously.
For Monica, they're much more than some pretty, famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that Mango makes at its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, win in the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have devised for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense but at the same time exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango based on this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the 1950s and 60s; from there we draw many references.
Then I really like to get lost in a city and watch women as they're dressed, as they combine and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, right?
I think so, but in the end, everything comes together and has a lot of common ties.
I've been liked the clothes since I was a kid; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to dig into my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dressed.
You know that dancers really like to do our stylings for classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when you get the costume is when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for the designers and professionalism.
You've turned 30 not long ago, has crisis gone into you?
What's up?
I feel better than ever, I like them.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
I don't scare the biological clock.
I've done the things I wanted since I was a kid and this has given me a lot of internal happiness.
So you think of being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because the body asks me and, besides, I want to be a young mom; I don't want to miss this.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you're watching several premieres that you rotated last year.
That's right and I already feel like you see the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless, I want everything for now and of course, cannot be.
I look forward to the premiere 'The Last Hour' and 'In search of the tomb of Christ'.
Let's see what you think...
A few days ago you debuted on a catwalk with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I went up on a catwalk to modeling.
He simply called me Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we exhibited - I took out two pieces from our collection for Mango - was auctioned to raise money for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know that tender heart of Naomi.
So many things are said about her that, I know her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm staying with that good part that she gets involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he comes to ask me to make the pine, then too.
For benefiting third world women, whatever it takes.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention Nissan has been inspired, this time, in nature, in particular bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, the BR23C is presented as an extension of the Security Shield from four areas of Nissan.
This robot intends to strengthen the collision prevention capacity of branded vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates their own personal oval-shaped space that looks a lot like Nissan's Shield of Safety.
But the most important thing is the composite eyes of the bee, able to see with an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within your own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they have called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It detects obstacles that are up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius in front of BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to a onboard microprocessor that immediately translates into the prevention of the collision.
"At the time you detect an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at right or greater angle to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate up or down, or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act according to that data.
It does not require saving information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work continuously with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may be surprising, but we're not talking about gigas of memory, not even megas."
This is the first step to developing new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan predicts will be introduced into serial cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the lithium-ion variety.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to their destination by avoiding obstacles along the way.
Repeated alcohol drivers will have to install the 'alcolock'
Interior wants the driver with three administrative sanctions for alcohol to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the drunk vehicle from starting, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and is now included in the annual report of the Attorney General's Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for one year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver, so he will also receive a course of road re-education.
In addition to the General Prosecutor of Segurida Vial, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Technological Institute for Automobile Safety Foundation (FITSA) will participate.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for drunk driving take the car again.
The alcolock would avoid it as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in breathed air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow abtes; or when an alcohol concentration is detected it is higher than that allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned person.
In this sense, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce infringements by up to 65% during the first year of implementation.
And in Spain it is estimated that 115 people could save the lives every year.
The measure is confined to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address such behaviour before they result in criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and, however, the necessary reform through criminal means requires a reform of an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial mode, although it has already been experimentally implemented in some commercial and public service vehicles.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on a PSOE initiative in which this system is proposed to be installed on school buses, just as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 5.40 p.m., the scheduled time in the program, the Spanish air force plane in Asturias was landing on the presidential hangar of Mexico City.
The sun was retreating but its rays were still forcing to use her hand as a visor to see the royal couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier he had asked on the street, the taxi driver, if he knew the Spanish Princes visited the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very good, then you can't go to the airport to charge at that time... She's from here or so...
No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very good...
But the Mexican press does know very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
Many wait in the airport hangar glued to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 Marine soldiers who interpret the salvation of honors.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the Princess, windy, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps she had been told that in the DF she threatened storm.
They give a smile and a brief stop to the photographers before moving on to the room where the official entourage awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four greats of the city, a reporter bluff of Mexican television awaits you.
Tiemble before you mortgage
It must be recognized that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of fluid to do injections, is not without ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from boarding garbage mortgages in questionable solvency banks, they have created a pleasant and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the 'Hotel of bad credits'... or the mess.
The tedious aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably his goal.
It is true that he has useful information, but little detail.
It's more a page for teens than a place for all audiences.
What if the game is completed?
Well, a dream room appears inside the hotel.
Something is something, because we can't even talk about buying a better house...
The best gifted prize in fashion
There may be no place in the world more suited to present a fashion prize, that Paris and possibly not a living designer more exquisite and bont live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of The Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of the new talents of fashion.
It is endowed with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in the Mango showcase at number 54 of the Haussmann Boulevard in Paris and almost wept from the excitement.
By the way, it is the second largest store in the firm in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first one is in London.
So many events, coupled with the desire to thank the designer Valentino for presiding over the jury of the contest, caused us to end up at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
With the closest of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango looked even more spectacular.
Nati, with the heart of grief and making guts heart, for the recent death of his brother, put on a house suit and ELAH dressings, which cut off his breath, and from his son Luis' arm - a cannon almost two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his homage dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, was doing the honors and is so gentleman that he ended up, next to Rotchil's baron, without a jacket, because he had both lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the store in pants and shirt - her own design - and for dinner she transformed in a sexy black dress, was thrilled when on the night walk by the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were taught the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a love of 'great fold'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the walk through the palace's outbuildings, but before he showed us on his mobile phone photos of his son.
The next morning we were able to welcome the view with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another canyon that moves by motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously asked, that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, l'l, c'est la vie.
1001, the anti-stress number
There is not 1000 but 1000 more a way to forget the chaotic and frantic daily life.
And in case it wasn't enough, everyone is gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it sounds every morning at 7 a.m., but it's even worse to imagine yourself wrapped up in the hectic pace that current life imposes.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there aren't one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and disconnection problems with the world of work.
No, the number is just, no less, than 1001.
Apart from the yoga positions, the classic massage or the treatments of 'spa', Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book an entire 'menu' of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores by the hand of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve tranquillity in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, disconnect your mind and focus on reading.
Talk asleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean these who wake up very savvy by telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who talk asleep.
The first time it happens maybe you get a scare, but it doesn't really matter.
It is a benign sleep disturbance called somnochios.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one has been told he spoke at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in life for example associated with a high fever episode), or more regularly (every day, once a week, once in meseS...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause to determine its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (footed asleep) or sleeping sleep, but it doesn't have to be so.
As we have mentioned above, they can also be associated with very high fever, stress or overexcitence.
Anyway, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
He may speak in a calm tone of voice, loose words, a murmur or the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches...).
In cases where the demonstration is very intense it would be advisable to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is any issues that are generating a lot of anxiety and gives him way out in this way.
We have said that it is a benign alteration, therefore it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disturbance that can be treated (e.g. if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress picture).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to get the child too excited before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid TV shows or series that are scary or a little violent.
With very nervous children who find it very difficult to relax, relaxing techniques can be used to help them acquire a certain internal calm.
This will encourage the child to have a quieter sleep.
Once the sleepy ones appear try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day you won't remember anything that has happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because he's not conscious, and you'll break his dream.
Even if he's talking, he's sleeping and is therefore resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during several episodes you should consult or find out what generates so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what you say (which is not the most common), do not fall into the temptation to ask you an interrogation to please you to extract information.
You will get nothing, because when you are asleep you are not conscious enough to organize your thought.
Besides, you'll hear what he says, but you don't know what he's dreaming of to say that, so he's very careful how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child you can interrogate him at night to find out his secrets.
I'm not even kidding.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's not bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last.
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory on their field after a long period of shortage.
Without having made a good match, the team created many goal chances and was able to score a goal to win the game.
The pace was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first try from captain Kauffmann who rubbed the squad with a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern was almost going to take the "power" and in turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold came to prevent Dannemarie's defence.
In front, we didn't let the midfielder pass and we left only Riahi in attack position.
The start of the second half was crucial, first with two chances from Riahi and Temporale goal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening score for the Illhousiens with the goal of Marais, well placed to collect the ball rejected in a first try from Diebold (53').
But scorer Illhousiens won't be able to taste his happiness for long and will be forced to return in the wardrobes a dozen minutes later and leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and will not be a problem for the 11-time illhousiens who pulled back a little to "compress" their defence, except in the last seconds of play during which, after a major farc, the ball passed very close to the cross-field.
Sarkozy finds the fishermen furious
Before taking off for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a roundabout for Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance on the part of the fishermen who severely disturbed last Monday the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistare, to find his representatives there.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that "it will come with concrete proposals."
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by Breton fishermen to achieve measures in the face of the increase in diesel prices, which sets a record by reaching 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies become competitive again and to save the jobs and remuneration conditions of sailors."
Fishermen wait for Nicolas Sarkozy on firm foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried operations to slow down traffic in Morbihan and Calvados, which have thus caused traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The Quiberon marina has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-Ele have not been stopped.
"A filter barrier" has been placed on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday burning, scratching the dawn, tyres and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Mancha, such as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the bous stayed in the port, or in Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of the trade ships.
Fishermen from La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantic region, stopped in the afternoon blocking of the important Total refinery of Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until this Wednesday's meeting that will take place to the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by leaders of the national fisheries committee, which did not hold their movement.
"The strike will continue "because "the fishermen did not abandon" and " do not want to travel to Paris," announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay fees on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but believe that the financial balance point of a boat can be reached only with a diesel price of less than 0.30 euro per litre.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of "Two Men and a Destiny" has died from cancer, at the age of 83, at his home in the Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes hailed film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautics company has 215 planes delivered this year despite threats of recession in the world economy.
The fourth world aeronautical builder, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 devices delivered, said Embraer President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian builder relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly to sell planes ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would aim to sell more than 15 % of its assets
Insurer American International Group, which has been buoyed by U.S. monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15 percent of its assets in order to repay its $85 billion loan, according to Sunday's edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to consider selling most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States, this newspaper says.
AIG's board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to discuss possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of the quails AIG intends to separate include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59 percent stake in insurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and investments in private equity, the Financial Times adds.
No final decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times goes.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to repay its $85 billion loan granted to the Federal Reserve at the risk of seeing the U.S. authorities take 80 percent of its capital, diluting it with the due proportion among current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange blamed a historic drop last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98 percent, a never-before-seen loss on the stock exchange of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial index fell 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most significant drop in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded last 17 September 2001, the day on which exchanges began again after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, to the dominant technology, fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the widened index(extended) Standard & Poor's 500 by 8.81 percent (or 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 units, according to the final figures for the closing.
Already depressed by the crisis earlier in the session, Wall Street sank after the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected the plane to save the banks that would have allowed some stability to be restored in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives denied US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two Republicans out of three rejected their plan.
"That's not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," FTN Financial said Lindsey Piegza.
"This shows how much the market had this plan," added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted in several days will come "too late."
"If the project is really moribund (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the American central bank, the N. Network) to manage the crisis, which would tighten credit conditions more," warned Brian Bethune, head of economics and finance at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every passing day the fall of a financial institution is announced" in the United States, Ms Piegza stressed.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual last Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by their rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, prompting emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets face "not only a crisis in the US but a global crisis," added the FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market rose dramatically.
The yield on the 10-year treasury bond fell by 3,632 percent, against 3,827 percent on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond by 4,161 percent, against 4,357 percent the day before.
Morgan Stanley sells stake to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disburse nine billion dollars to acquire 21 per cent of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a sharp drop in its stock exchange listing.
A week after unveiling an interim deal, both banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9 percent of Morgan Stanley ordinary shares at the per unit price of $25.25, or $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 per cent of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion with the purchase of convertible securities which will ensure a return of 10 per cent and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the global transaction would be carried out on the basis of a unit price of 29 dollars, or 28 per cent above its current change.
Morgan Stanley shares lost 6.79 per cent to $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
"This strategic partnership is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status," explained Juan Mack, the CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted the new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he moves on under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt much more cautious behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20 percent of its shares to Japanese for almost $8.5 billion.
"A week ago," Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG's chief executive, explained in Tokyo, "we thought the stake would have been made up only of ordinary shares.
But in view of the current situation of the economy and the market, we have wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves. "
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7 % below its book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20 percent of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares within a year if they are sold at more than 50 per cent above the conversion price, or $47 or so, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow it to take investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group refused, however, to give details of the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15 percent, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said he had eased his balance sheet greatly from the end of August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, which saw its stock market listing fall by half while the cost of security against a risk of defects on its debt took off.
This cost fell last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12 per cent.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's big investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Refound the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, on the example of his colleagues and friends, he was the third to vote on a bill for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64 per cent of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to the official results referring to 80 per cent of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28 %, 7 per cent of the votes were null and void and 0.7 per cent were blank votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of polling stations and a recount by a non-governmental organization had announced a broad victory to the "yes," estimating it between 63 % and 70 percent.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly," he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians who lead the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will take place in full calm, according to the observer mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft Constitution implies an increase in the power of the state over the economy, reserving the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and thanks to foreign exchange sent by their emigrants.
Carried by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the head of State, who will be able to hold up to two consecutive terms of four years each and will have the possibility to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would use this power and would seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the president began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally foresees the interdiction of the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as the starting point of American anti-drug operations.
Obama, winner during the first televised duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House was another to find out who has triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's benefit, although honorable, was not "pretty "brilliant" to allow him to slow his drop in polls five weeks after the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll released last Saturday gives Obama five points ahead of Obama (49 percent versus 44 percent for McCain), judges that it is the Democrat who went well.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama won 39 percent of respondents, while 25 percent of them give McCain the victory, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his advantage Thursday with the good expected benefit of his member of the same candidacy, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He has good instincts," Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
Septuagenarian McCain highlighted his indisputable foreign policy experience, stressing the "naivety" of his adversary on these issues that were at the heart of this first confrontation.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that he's accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president," he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican televised ads.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without bewilderment, he was concise and precise.
He enhanced his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"Mchampain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done so," he replied, this weekend, a Democratic television ad that reproached the Republican for not considering the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans."
"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in a rain.
He did not utter the words "middle class" or "workers." "Financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the most capable of saving the economy on the edge of the cliff.
"Next week could be a decisive episode," said the influential and Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster "is the final consequence of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that it would nevertheless reduce taxes from 95 percent for Americans despite Wall Street shocks, the Illinois senator also noted that the realization of the country's eventual energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the creation of a safety and health system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudential, both candidates dodged the issues surrounding the $700 billion ($470 billion euro) financial rescue plan adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
"In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk? "
Young and opponents demonstrated last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislatures in advance.
Some hundreds of Belarusians have met on Sunday afternoon since the closure of polling stations in Minsk's central square to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While no outcome had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, he has to resign."
Some acknowledge not having voted: "For what, as they will do what they want with my vote," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that brought foreign observers to a good face in order to renew contact with the European Union is ready to bring about democratic change.
The sanctions, including the verse of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered fair for observers.
They weren't, according to the opposition.
"We have been placed next to the electoral commissions and our observers could not participate in the counting of the votes," lamented Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman for the Union of the Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regroupment of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change," says Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, is the executive branch.
If some opposition MPs enter parliament, it is because they will have been appointed but not elected.
But his entry into parliament can mean television appearances, meetings in the regions and bills. "
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "we must start the dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which has a lot of debts in front of Russia, goes into crisis, and if we don't reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent.'
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that the turnout figures seemed too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26 per cent of voters in Minsk) favoured manipulation.
"Have you noticed the election? It is up to Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five MPs from the opposition to parliament, who are best suited to power. "
The silence of the night returns again in the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the central electoral commission welcome their success.
The 19 people kidnapped have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
By the morning, they had been released by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
All of them looked good on arrival at 15h30 aboard a special aircraft at the Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to Maadi Hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical tests, so they have not been able to speak to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On 19 September, these hostages fell into the hands of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying a SUV safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since passed from one juice to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, in charge of the organization of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, carried aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault overnight before dawn.
"An exchange of gunfire occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others have fled," said this person who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men from the secret services, of the special forces," he said without going into details.
He also denied paying a ransom.
The day before the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an SUV on board which the kidnappers were, of which six were killed, including the Chadian chief and arrested two.
He also stated that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Unity (SLA-U), a statement immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Silent majority of culture
A debate about the financing of the culture of the manchetes and occupies the current election campaign.
Better like that.
But a section of our cultural life remains always forgotten.
Who will rise to denounce the miserable sums given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that starve?
Which politician will dare remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don't we have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros to restore only Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage has to be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Quebec's history societies, at least 40,000 benevolent people regrouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy care about looking into history, preserving with little money piles of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
These are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and managers throw their bulldozers at our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
By when, a monument to history and heritage?
The interview - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday its 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has once again been one of the safest and most effective suppliers of blood in the world.
And above all, it regained the public's confidence that it had seriously been hesitated by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and public discontent, the Government of Canada conducted a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and make recommendations so that such a disaster should not be reproduced anymore.
While Judge Krever was slow to present their relationship, some provinces then set up a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee accomplished this mission.
As a result of the reports by Gélineau and Krever, two providers have been created in Canada: Hemema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, almost 38 percent of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec," Decary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work over the years that followed, we have regained public confidence," he says before proudly stating that in early 2008, about 94 per cent of the Quebec population was now confident in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that "confidence is something extremely fragile."
Since its inception on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we attended in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says Decary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
Then we rely on one of the main recommendations of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to which when we do not know and when a serious disease can emanate from that, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease characterized by a brain degeneration that inevitably leads to death, we set up exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had stayed in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been proven beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by the blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied had the meaning. "
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique for HIV detection appeared on the market: nuclei acid tests that allow the presence of the virus to be detected directly in the blood of donors and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
The nuclei acid tests allowed to shorten the period between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period by less than a week.
We thus substantially reduce the risk that certain donors will be infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements allowed the risk of contracting AIDS considerably lowered by a blood transfusion.
Today, one person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
'That means 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
So since Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will be more than 24 years before an HIV transmission case is overtaken by a blood product.
I think you can now receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to regain health without worries," says the head of the management of Hema-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen might emerge in the system.
Last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on Reunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by a blood insect.
We must be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary pursues before stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Hema-Québec must also provide for sufficient supply.
" Needs are increasing because the population ages.
Because the most aggressive cancer treatments, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
Population ageing also has consequences for the network of blood donors, which annually brings together on average only 3 per cent of eligible Quebeckers to blood donation. "
All people in good health, aged 18 and corresponding to the eligibility criteria, however, can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of people who propose their blood are not accepted because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they traveled in a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With this 3 %, we managed to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
The hardships are very rare.
But members of this network of donors must be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it's hard to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to hold them and encourage them to be a regular donor.
Since today's life is very unbridled, we rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate your blood," Francine Décary grieves.
With a budget of $297 million a year, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered biomedical waste is filled with rich blood of stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago, putting on the bench of our thousandth blood sample of the umbilical cord and is expected to get more than a thousand of these per year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts early next year," says Doctor Decary who describes this lace-blood-wielding program as very popular.
"Many moms are disappointed not to be able to enjoy this," as Hema-Québec does not have the resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softball - The Impact in the semifinals
The Montreal Impact was qualified for the semifinals of the USL's first division elimination series, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 victory in short) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the quarter-final series, at Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first goalless time from no side, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many goal chances.
Roger Levesque was the only che toss Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let's remember that during the first game of the round-trip series, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex in Tukwila, in the Seattle suburb.
The Impact will be measured to the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinal.
On Saturday afternoon at Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the game back to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless agreed in the semifinals by 5-4.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday next, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief - Kovalev's victorious goal
The Canadian's number one trio are ready to start the season.
The composite unit of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a 3-2 win of the Canadian to barrier free throws against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the Tricolor quarter in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal.
" I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
"I need another game to feel comfortable. "
He tried to play maximum in the first half, Guido Carbonneau scored.
But I think it appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation. "
Charest takes care of the North
PM does not rule out starting elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party is over, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to make himself elected during today's by-election.
Rejecting the limits of our last great border in the north": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force by staying on the broad lines, at the end of the general council of the liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They paraded, on three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps," maps, etc.
Great media like during the election period.
The prime minister thinks the election will take place this fall, although he showed his schedule was very full.
The "North Plan" is the fourth side of a "vision" that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space," which includes a labor agreement with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel to immense potential," but did not give a term, investment amounts, no precise priority in future projects.
What could be most developed above all are: particularly hydroelectricity, the forest, but especially the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond," according to Mr. Charest.
This "two-time large territory like France," " is our home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it home to ours, but it's in us," he insisted, as if to show that he asked for a national founding myth.
Quebec was built a lot because of its relationship with the North, he stressed: the flood to gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it's our future," he added, having made a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70 per cent of the Quebec territory, comprises a part of the Labrador that Quebec always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
"It is a traditional position that all governments reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion arises, I reiterate that position on the part of the government," he said.
In addition, "with climate change, we must rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the passage from the northwest, which will open each year due to the ice smelting.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers occupying the territory to be a duty.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP of the Quebec party of Ungava), have already begun consultations about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Beno-t Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role to play in some work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out an important meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a meeting at which "a common vision will be given."
The development of the North would be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan "will be agreed, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the Liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"As the liberals who preceded us, we have thought otherwise to transform the challenges on new occasions of growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring weekend themes, which began on Friday with a large cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival in power of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rebrand the Beauharnois Central in Embalse Adélard-Godbout.
"De Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that made the Revolution quiet and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa that made James Bay our party knew how to forge the future," said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative, to John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Touching the theme of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydro reservoir project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commission is scheduled for 2012.
"This stays between us, but I preview being there," he confided to his militants, raising applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that elections would not take place in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of putting in place a vote this fall, which the law allows him.
He stresses that his schedule is nevertheless full, particularly because of a mission of the federation's council in China and a Quebec-New York York summit.
The weekend's general council supplied the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly "constitutional aspirations" that had no problem being accepted: the Quebec Liberal Party calls in particular for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they would have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we embraced the broad lines of the Northern Plan with skepticism.
Quebec party leader Pauline Marois highlighted the North Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, coming to power in 2003, resigned.
If I had, "we would make progress today," said Ms Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (voy that took place today), Francoise Mercure.
Quebec's Democratic Action seemed to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what you want is that this is not just a spectacle," said leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns on vacation today.
Letters - A disgraced country
It's Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (oh irony) in the Harper cabinet, which was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "shame" for Canada.
So disgrace this woman who led an incessant battle for justice and who deserves all our admiration for what everything says about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in the face of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the acts that are recriminated to him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and leaves a child-soldier living in inhumane conditions.
The only one who is intrusive justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to enjoy the benefit of an equitable process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: it doesn't care that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of exposings.
We still don't realize that, but we are witnessing at this moment an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy," that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that makes no sense.
The time has come when there is no more morality: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far minority wants (what will happen after October 14?).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that praises Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see this government relinquishing what the reputation and dignity of our country did.
Mr. Toews shame is provoked by this resignation and nothing else.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian speech
In its 17 September edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the world's largest gold company attempted a six-million-euro defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke "transparent public debate."
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of defamation persecutions, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. - Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to bring a public debate to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to theirs?
The outcome of the lawsuit is of little importance, the authors and publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the miner's almost bottomless pockets.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often about ruining the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will loosen the opposition in addition to frightening whoever will dare to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it is in the eyes of the public that he would have had to present his view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually done by changing ideas and not to sticks.
It was therefore enough for the mining company to open its books, its files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent search teams that would have been able to clarify the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to trust the public and rejects the petitions and bra letters to the authors of Noir Canada.
Possibly, sir. Could Garver explain how he can call for a "public" debate by disparaging his views?
According to the vice president, it seems that this word only designates highly paid lawyers and not for all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What he doesn't understand - or what he doesn't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does it especially because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is willing to listen to and judge Bar, but based on civilized changes of arguments, and not within the framework of what many people perceive as a chase-gatherer (seeking "public debate," Barrick Gold has just placed a request regarding the authors of Noir Canada urging them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Garver, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on freedom of university search and truth, essential for all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under the penalty of many persecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold truly wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he claims, he doesn't feel like making a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for public debate in Canada, and it is high time for governments to place devices that limit this genre of abusive persecution.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $US700 billion plan that aims to stem the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
It provides in particular: better control by those elected from its implementation, of new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the public money invested, the new provisions to contain the number of houses seized the non-payment, as well as a right of control over the wages paid to the leaders of the assisted companies.
The American Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a marathon of negotiations last two days.
"We make great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"It's all been done to cover the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current crisis on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"It's the fundamental point: if we don't do this, trauma, chaos and disruption to the daily lives of Americans will be immense," Republican Judd Gregg said.
Negotiations had been over very quickly in recent hours because they feared the effect of further failure on investors' mood.
The last hour they had set themselves was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, who have joined the negotiations late, were rather favorable for the agreement, not forgetting, however, to remove their discontent of being forced to reach this tip.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly the one that would allow owners to keep their homes and the salary of the leaders of state-survivored companies.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, we must not be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary," he said on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, questioned on another network to find out if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote on it. "
"The important points I read [show] that is something we will have to digest and with which we can advance.
He said the option of doing nothing is not acceptable."
The $700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers' money the dubious debts, the risky and unsellable assets of American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the burst of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans before spreading to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and causing a liquidity freeze and a disbandment of banks and financial institutions.
It's a group of Republican elected voters that had changed the first bill of agreement last week.
We believe we have come out of the impasse since Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of struggling companies are only insured by the government, rather than bought.
In order to smooth out the roughness for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision stipulating that if the government had to take losses for five years with this program, it could impose new fees that would seek to help it recover money.
The new plan envisages paying a first part of $250 billion to which 100 billion more can be added if the president finds it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote by Congress.
Instead of its help, Washington will get shares in the aided companies that will pay dividends in the event of profits and that it will be able to sell again when the storm will be passed.
The federal government will have the possibility to delay embargo procedures involving housing obtained from real estate loans under this scheme, as well as set limits on remuneration and cash compensation paid to the leaders of companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote of the House of Representatives from today and to that of the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all his efforts, he is still not sure that his plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest this bill yesterday, both on the part of Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the chamber's finance committee, told his constituents that "with all evidence, Washington doesn't want to understand."
"We have a very serious financial problem.
There are some solutions.
But not the one that consists of profiting from taxpayers."
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, who is a small group cheerleader in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
" Four hundred economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us to tell us: we ask Congress not to hurry and carefully examine the path to be taken," he said yesterday.
At this very moment, in Europe, we again had the test of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
Intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had resigned from buying its bankrupt competitor since losing 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) during the risky real estate loan crisis in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the 20 largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, we regain a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It's just something savers and families appreciate now that times are uncertain. "
During this time, on the other side of the blaze, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley bank and more than 41 billion euros ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it is the one that would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford bank and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a compromised icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
Had the American actor with a lovely smile freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that was evident will also have kept him away from the record of power that true sacred monsters have.
But what a great background runner.
Paul Newman, who died Friday at 83, from lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, whom he looked a lot like and who was long regarded as a rival in cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes children magnificent.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin.
One of the glorious faces of the American dream will be born of these European roots.
No disproportionate ego, last quality mark.
Because it projected an entire country in love with the self-made man, of the combatant of the Pacific war, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale, then frequented the New York Actor's Studio, before triumphing in the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
This man who militated for civil rights was also the autopilot who qualified in second place in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, bent by a sex symbol, although a member of a modeling couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The secret sides of this secret star, discreet and committed, allergic to scandals of the entertainment world that we do not know very well, also disappear with him.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death caused vertigo to filmmakers this weekend, as they interslect their large roles on the black screen of memorabilia.
More than a half-century of the seventh American art in perpetual move parades through it.
Many memories come back to reminiscent as Butch Cassidy's charming cow-boy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata on Tennessee Williams' adapted zinc roof in 1958.
Closer to us, we evoke your sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not keep all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone down in the history of cinema.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, a criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean, repeated after his death, who truly threw at Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic manger in the sumptuous film The Sting (The Hit), Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter and avenging billiard player in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), he will reprise the character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar from nine nominations in 1987.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
Still him.
Epochs change during his career.
The young people know him mostly thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 at The Coen brothers' The Hudsucker Proxy.
With a final role as godfather of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the curl was curled.
Unlike several film legends who left the race quite soon, Newman stayed a lot in the world of cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its antics and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier regarded it, with humor, as a challenge that lives in "underplaying" and who judges his performances too supported.
The profession wasn't always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman whom the papers came to for a long time doing nothing.
However, he interpreted the role of young gallant less often than marginal: neurotic, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose traits reflected the rebellions.
As a filmmaker, Newman revealed his true not-so-known prudential sensibility.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott because of overdoses dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a play of modesty and sadness.
Among the numerous tributes that were sparked yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former co-star Robert Redford (they had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, "my life and my country were better thanks to their existence."
Generosity, love of existence are important traits of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legend career, a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a counter-attack against Hollywood excesses is also hidden.
We will see his face reign a lot on the cans of vinaigrette sauce, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it started as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to their Foundation for Children in difficulty.
Newman, rather than contenting his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters with a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there. "
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What did they produce at the Zuschlag &amp; Co bill factory. ?
Very soon, on 8 October, criminal proceedings will begin against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing fraud of significant harm, in a business manner, continuously and in an organized manner in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecutor &apos; s Office, they used for their own purposes the funds obtained in the public competitions, justifying on many occasions the fulfilment of the tasks with false invoices.
Public funds and that of municipalities - in its entirety about 65 million HUF - stopped in part in the treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organization and partly in the pockets of private individuals.
The method, which was also released by the investigators, was to justify the collection of funds obtained from public competitions with false invoices behind which there was no real execution, the various associations never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the prosecution, most of the invoices were false.
To do this, they obtained the heel at the market in the Józsefváros District and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that on behalf of which company the counterfeit invoice should be made was decided among others on that tour of the Superior Region of Balaton where János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for their consumption and they served as a model for the preparation of the invoices they presented, among others, in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as in the City of the Capital.
These invoices were signed mostly by István Lados and his accomplice András Eri, who, according to our information, rather wrote the necessary reports to obtain public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" the sides chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomic center provided the food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyes-let Association.
But - according to the centre manager - so many people don't fit in that place at the same time.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb J.vért Foundation - later called Egy-tt to Harmadik "vezredérért" - was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however the bill consisted of one hundred and thirty people.
But the manufacturers of the big fantasy invoice also exaggerated when they pointed to the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. Because in the books of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents in the name of Jobb J.vért and Hoppá.
The company's manager told hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecution and showed him the invoices, he already knew that they were false documents.
"On the label the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal problems, it also did not agree that according to the bill 100 people were housed, since they have only eleven rooms in which there are not so many people.
In addition, the bill also included meals, while the restaurant hasn't worked for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice manufacturers were not informed either that the travel agency chosen in Budapest organizes exclusively trips abroad, so that in the cash payment bill they foolishly indicated as a service a trip within Hungary, which did not coincide with the agency's bills practice.
In addition - as was known during the investigation - they included VAT also in the document, despite the fact that travel outside the territory of the European Union was tax-free.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révf.l.p Kft. for the Jobb J.vért foundation, since the services of that company are not loaded with 25 but only with 15 percent VAT, in addition the hotel employees only extended invoices made by machine however the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "expeditors" made other mistakes as well, as in the case of a company in which they put on the bill as an activity carried out the road transport to which - it was known during the prosecution's investigations - the company founded as an investment consultant does not make.
Also due to formal differences - inappropriate format of the invoice, false seal - it was known that the invoices issued for Egy'tt to Harmadik "Marrérért Alapítvany, for XXI" are false. Századi Kulturális Egyes-let and for Biztos Pont.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied issuing those invoices.
The forgers also did not pay attention to the fact that when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyes-let ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, that is why the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - denied having issued such a document.
They consciously expressed the bills
Another group of fake invoice manufacturers are made up of those who were aware that they should issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítván , at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued invoices worth about four million HUF in the name of the Egy-tt Foundation to Harmadik Evezredért.
The manager of Collab Kft. - according to the indictment - was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Gyerfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
In the same way, he collaborated with Zuschlag and his accomplices the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, which in 2003 provided invoices worth approximately five million HUF to the Jobb J.vért Alapítvvan Foundation, the association Atlasz Egyes-let and the association V.rsfeny-Egyes-let , without real economic activity behind it.
There was no movement of capital either, because then they cancelled the prepared invoices but they forgot to record this entity in their documents.
The next group of false invoice manufacturers includes those who have some connection with the defendants.
For example Ivan Kubatov was the demand of the Ukrainian manager of the fictional-based Delta Trio SL in Budapest, which dealt with the fuel and vehicle trade.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer means.
According to the research data, these invoices were purchased by Kiskunhalas Cash Investment Kft, which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should also have released the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices for the Atlasz, for the Hoppá and for Egy-tt to Harmadik "Martur" Alapitány charging the amount himself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually functioned because - according to the defendant - they did not receive work.
But he took advantage of these companies, since at the request of his accomplice lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations linked to Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generáció.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities worth HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor's Office considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10 per cent of the invoices.
That man even took advantage of the society in command of Szi-Beri to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generáció and Sz-vetség a Modern Magyarországért presented a competition in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
The competition obtained 500 thousand HUF respectively, but did not use the money for the competition's objectives.
So that this is not discovered, five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft were submitted to the TMA.
These were the invoices found during the search of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants will probably report at the trial - as they did in the Prosecutor's Office - the course of the falsification of the invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the main defendant János Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For their confessions have not so far been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not done so so far.
The question is: what interest is it?, because perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists reached an agreement with him so that Zusi assumes all responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days was even able to be offended, since to relieve his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the many perpetrators of much higher-value economic crimes, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can wait in their own home for sentencing, he has no chance for that.
Psychology of the overlapping: Why do we spend more money?
Auction participants are prone to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at New York University discovered the neurological - economical bases of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study in the journal Science, people don't want to lose out in competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" through experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups played lottery, the other participated in an auction and in the meantime the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment were examined through the functional magnetic resonance imaging system (fMRI).
In both games participants could make money, but during auctions, where it is essential to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the operation of the complex called a stratum under the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "self-advancement" mechanism of the nervous system.
According to scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention so as not to provoke an intense reaction of the stratum.
To substantiate their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups bet on a person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product in question, and its members bet.
Another group, in addition, was promised that if they win, they would receive $15 more prize money.
Instead, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in the event of losing the auction the group's members even lost that money.
Thus the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, by checking the neurologists' hypothesis, members of the group who played "against failure" were willing to bet even more than members of the control group and the "winner" group.
"These results cannot be deduced from any economic theory previously existing.
For those until now explained the phenomena of the auctions only with the joy of winning and the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped to resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor at New York University's faculty of economics.
Hepatitis: When should you go to your doctor?
World around 500 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and chronic liver disease in Hungary is considered one of the main causes of death.
It is estimated at one hundred thousand the number of people infected in this country, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many of the sick do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is the common name for different liver diseases caused by viruses.
Symptoms are a lot of similar; liver and jaundice infection are characteristic, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are very different.
Hepatitis viruses in dependence on the pathogen are spread by two main forms: hepatitis A and E by food (e.g. with water or infected food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body moods (waiting, vagina mood, saliva).
Travelers are recommended to protect themselves by vaccine against the A and B viruses, against C there are no vaccines.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating the infected food, manifested through a general poor condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that the jaundice appears on the skin and white of the eyes, the excrement becomes clear, the urine dark and the healing can last even two - three weeks.
Annually one million people die in the world in cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to calculations, only one in ten infected people receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can lead to liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most infected people do not know that he is sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys the liver cells and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Therefore, premature examination, systematic medical control, is very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and those wearing tattoos.
There are currently about 200 million people in the world suffering from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with a routine laboratory check-up as well, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing some unknown symptoms.
The disease has cure if discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so contagion can be suppressed and cancer prevented.
September 30 is the World Day of Hepatitis, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its objective is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their premature recognition.
The Dutch governments are nationalizing a part of the Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands states - the first to be in Europe - will help with nationalisation the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis that is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis of the US market: the three countries will support this financial and insurance institution that also has business in Hungary with an additional 11,2 billion euros.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held consultations at a higher level with the President of the European Central Bank and the head of the European Commission's economic competence.
Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the eurozone crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has occurred in several waves more than a year ago, therefore the decisions taken with regard to the Bank can in a sense be considered as precedents.
According to the decision taken in the early hours of Sunday, the three states will buy about half (49 per cent) of the bank's property in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell part of its business, including mainly the activities - mainly insurance - bought last year by the Dutch ABN Amró.
Fortis' shares began a sharp decline last week and by the second half of the week there were already significant signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees this Bank is too big to allow it to break.
The company's shares on Friday fell 12 percent, the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Looking at current share prices, the group's total value of the group's capital on the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to company executives this is not real.
The Bank's management blamed the sharp fall in Fortis shares on US market insecurities in connection with the approval of the $700 billion US package plan.
On Monday, the shares showed a slight increase.
On Friday, they appointed Filip Dierckx as the bank's new CEO.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a specific offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured that investors did not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
Among the Bank's clients so far there was no panic, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
El Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also bought leasing companies.
Does it hurt less to who you believe in God?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith has a calming effect that also relieved the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Oxford University scientists conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed that religious belief in what way it influences human pain, the British newspaper Telegraph reported.
As part of this unique experiment, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists applied electric shock, meanwhile everyone was watching a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the human brain scanning technique, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first in the series of research in which, alongside academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University also participate.
The analysis occurred as follows; they fixed a sparkling instrument to the patient's left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at two paintings; the Virgin Mary, the work of 17th century Sassoferrato and Leonardo da Vinci's Lady of the 15th century.
The researchers had hoped that the show of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain religious mood among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and thought it had a reassuring effect.
Patients spent half an hour on an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electric shocks in four successive parts during the period while watching the religious-themed paint or the other.
Catholics claimed that when they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt in "security" as "protected" people, "they calmed down and in their hearts peace reigned."
Looking at the religious theme picture, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any such shocking image you can achieve a similar effect with atheists as well, you only have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person they feel very positively about, like a mother or father," the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases really changes our personality," Wright added.
After these formidable results there is only one question: what effect would it have on the regulation of pain if Leonardo's Madonna or another painter of his size were shown to the faithful?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You're what you say about yourself
On its tenth birthday the Google can say: you can find it both in people's pockets, as well as in the sky above your head; you know where you spent your vacation, what doctors you visit and what they are interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this is not enough yet.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel with Orwelian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main objective is to gather as much personal data as possible on its users, and this is necessary to meet the original objectives of Google's founders: "Let us bring together all the information in the world in a system."
According to the Google leader, the company even after ten years of work that stirred the world is still in the initial phase of the effort to be able to deal with all the information.
To the question what is going to happen in five years' time Schmidt replied: "I would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the job I best would best suit?" - however, the software will not be able to answer questions that seem so simple as long as there is not enough user information.
Not all netizens are aware that during their browsing on the Web the searched keywords, IP addresses and pages where they went through at the end of the search are stored.
Thanks, for example, Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-check what they were looking for before, which they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - in this same logic will be based on the system, on which the system will offer us products and services based on the preferences previously defined and stored.
What will happen if they take advantage of my data against myself, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who care about watching Google's information monopoly.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is already a confirmed fact that they not only retain, but in justifiable cases they also give to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of netizens.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, when Google gave the Brazilian government the information from its website, called Orkut, to identify paedophiles.
On the other hand, netizens who care about people's rights in May were relieved when the company, together with the EFF, an organization for the defense of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated in the court that it was right in its litigation with the FBI: according to the judgment, Google cannot be forced, through any of the points of the constitution to provide any information requested in secret by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to achieve under the pretext of strengthening the child protection law passed years ago, about fifty thousand Web addresses and about a thousand phrases searched, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of websites and keywords of the last two months.)
This is quite contradictory to Google's opinion: it is criticized by those who fear supplying their personal data because they think it harms their privacy, their private life when they start using Google's services, and rebel against it as against multinational conservative image companies.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries see in them the future generation, the "avant-garde corporation," not so to its rival, Microsoft, listed by its Windows as conqueror of the world, as much as they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, no money for their apps, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborative than the official software giant's practice.
But it may also be because geeks accurately see the very problematic relationship between people's rights and the Internet that occurred precisely by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional traces behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measurements of these individual variations, the essence remains the same: show ourselves.
A normal young man can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers a list of their music customs, then they can be included in a tracking system such as the FriendFeed or the Blip.fm, they can also have a blog, in which the latest photo galleries that are stored on Flickr or in the Picasa automatically appear.
We can know numerous cases from which it appears that, for example, the bride, when she saw the flow of photographs the next morning of the common friends, finds out who her fraudulent boyfriend spent the night before or they can fire the employee of a company because he writes his sincere opinion on his blog about the company's management: one thing is certain, the definition of private life was completely revalued.
A person's "on-line" life is what they show from themselves - this is the definition that hides behind the youth's behavior of our day.
And the one who wants to hide something, or at least pretends to dodge Google's monopoly, can do it (starting for example with the Scroogle that uses Google's search system, but leaves no traces).
There are many people who don't want to register on the collective pages to prevent them from finding them, but Google's "on-line" apps can be replaced, from word-writing software to image and news reading apps with alternative versions that don't connect to giant servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
Public opinion almost openly hopes that the day Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, while the services that are introduced increasingly cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also numerous other software developers.
Critical observers will however find the alarming contradictions too: for example the senior management flatly rejected the employee protest after doubling the price of the company's nursery, they considered the unlimited number of employee food too expensive, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google ceded in the face of pressure from the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement leaked any information that violated the good morality and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says they won't announce any new service in advance, but only when it's ready to work, what is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to stir the world: while some believe that Google's scanning and book and magazine project will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be summoned by the U.S. Supreme Court, others fear its Health system, because in it we can create our own full health profile, with previous analysis, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database will be able to provide good raw material for writers of science fiction works, the Scroogled, a novel by the popular Cory Doctorow, describes Orwelianly that future, in which a man only of Google's data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped erase the perpetrator of the double murder of the city of Azd.
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ezd who, according to substantiated suspicion, helped erase the traces of the crime, said Tuesday the spokesman for the General Public Order Police Station of Borsod province.
The young women recognized the crime that was charged to them, and are currently accused of criminal perpetrators.
The two minors - according to information from the Hungarian News Agency, these are two girls - will be able to defend themselves at large.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of Ezd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pretrial detention since Sunday.
He is charged with the crime of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the inquests it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he summoned his creditor to the headquarters of an Ezd company, where he killed him and then also killed the victim's 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from the MTI, the young man prepared much earlier to perpetrate the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden at the crime scene.
Police are looking at the weapon and the circumstances of its use with an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange submitted an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros - about five billion Czech kronor - for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the Czechs having previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state that in a few months' time it wants to sell 60 percent of them.
The Czech economic newspaper E15 reported that the offer of the Poles has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, so far they have offered the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B.rse.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that with it, in the future, the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion kronor.
According to the shareholder agreement, about 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25 percent, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the deepening international financial crisis speak of a "second of September."
The global financial catastrophe is due to the US president - the Republic of Rome believes - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the bill hastily done, whose objective is to solve this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor," which billionaire investor Warren Buffett spoke of, it's more correct to talk about a "second September 11."
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In El Mundo's view, the mistake of the political leadership of the United States was the one that brought the world economy to the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the American monetary system is growing and this will then have an impact on the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, the danger arises after the congressional vote that Washington does not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
This threat cannot be ignored - says the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still throw lifeline belts at shaky financial institutions, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
But if as the domino falls apart even more bank, then neither the new funds, nor the new improvisations, nor will the new improvisations be enough.
It takes long-term for European Union member states to put aside their nationalist selfishness and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
Crisis finance institutions received more than 100 billion euros on Monday alone - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that concerns that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis are becoming increasingly real.
The EU has so far not been seriously addressed by the crisis that passes like a chop on the Old Continent .
The "savengers" will not immediately have to submit hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is the justification for using taxpayers' funds to avoid further evil?
The smart car mimics the bee flight
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not imitation of existing obstacle sensors in nature?
For example, the bumblebee.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the bumblebee gave the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the BR23C automotive robotic steering system of nature imitator, which was given the characteristics of the buzzers, with the ultimate aim of creating a system that can dodge all collisions.
During the flight each bubble creates its own particular oval space that actually looks a lot like our safety protective capsule - explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, technological director of RP and development and research.
They play an important role the composite eyes of the bumblebees who are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composite eyes, engineers used the laser-length measurement system.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor of the vehicle that immediately transforms into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle robot imitating the movements of the bumblebees, modifies the direction by turning the wheels as necessary.
Unlike any current system, this maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If not, the vehicle robot could not react quickly enough to dodge obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It should react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety protective capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are now considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bumblebee does to dodge other bumblebees.
This process should be done in the blink of an eye.
However, unlike the bumblebees, the movement cannot be directed up, down or diagonal, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of spin of the wheels
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for the bumblebees to dodge other bumblebees, here they only used as a possibility for the robot of the car the rotating movement and acceleration also the brake.
The BR23C uses litho-polymer batteries that are lighter and their energy density is higher, meaning they have a longer life lifespan than that of lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the data processing capacity, let alone the storage capacity.
This device in each second should only process some input signals and react as appropriate.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data of the previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
No memory of gigabytes, or megabytes, are needed.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately dodge the obstacles, which according to Nissan's calculations, in ten years' time it will be able to join the models manufactured in series.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, dodging the obstacles in his path.
This very expensive kid's already has a name.
The written version of the $700 billion financial rescue package has been prepared and will be implemented in several phases in order to buy bad loans from banks.
Half the money will be spent in the first phase.
According to East Coast hours during new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement on the $700 billion financial bailout package in total, after several days of discussion, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the American Congress, saying it is only necessary to formalize the agreement in a document.
The commitment made to the package was supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the finance minister, speaking about the outcome of the commitment, said: "This programme will work and be efficient but further action is needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the car around the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, that is on Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington schedule (i.e. before two o'clock in the morning on Monday, according to Central European hours), without causing a spectacular jump in the stock exchanges.
On the bill called the 2008 economic stabilization emergency bill, the first Monday will be voted by the American Congress and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made overnight and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the White House spokesman.
The program is different from the Bush administration's original proposal to spend all of the $700 billion to buy securities of poor quality credit fund.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, the Finance Ministry will buy credit, poorly rated securities of credit and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president's decision.
This program will be controlled by a special agency, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion could be spent after a new congressional decision.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it will be able to simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages and credit fund securities, in addition to other "poisonous" loans as well.
The purchase can be made at auctions or directly - competent persons of the ministry reported.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the finance portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson said: The law thus ensures the necessary financial means, that it can even reach 700 billion dollars to meet the urgent needs of the US financial system, whether it is the purchase of bad financial means, its insurance or the prevention of risks that could lead to the collapse of some major financial institutions.
We do everything we need to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it," he added.
Instead, bank chiefs who are in trouble and expect state help will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensation, which the US slang simply calls golden parachutes.
Only in some specific cases will payments be limited, and limitations depend on the form of aid of the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in the framework of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed on the golden parachutes unless the bank's failed boss retires.
By buying the bad loans directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that bosses' compensation is not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, existing golden parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations relate only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the programme as well.
This is the first case in American history that a legal limitation on the income of the CEOs will be in effect - said this measure Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the committee of Congress, responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares from the banks participating in the program, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they will ultimately be able to even make profits from the transaction as soon as the economy recovers and with it the bank.
Under the bill over the next five years, the president will have to present to Congress a proposal on how to return taxpayers to the losses of the financial sector.
Of course on both sides there were those who expressed reservations about the project.
"This is not what American citizens entrusted to us, that is, the taxpayer dollars are not being protected," said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
His Ohio Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur said: the measures were urged by those who are responsible for the crumbling Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 percent compared to last month's prices and 12.9 percent compared to August 2007 prices - the Central Bureau of Statistics (KSH) reported.
Industrial export prices rose by 1.1 per cent from July 2008 and fell 3.9 per cent from the previous year.
And as a result of domestic and export price changes, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent from the previous month and 3.2 per cent from the previous year.
Industrial sales prices rose by just one measure, at 0.1 percent.
Domestic sales prices in the processing industry sectors rose minimally, up 0.1 percent from July.
The largest increase in the size of prices occurred in August 2008, in the leather and footwear production sector (2.8 per cent), due in the first place to increase the bags and belts per month and the 2.5 per cent increase in footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical production branch (1.6 per cent).
There was a price decrease in the petrochemical sector (1.4 per cent), in the production of electrical machines and instruments (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum extent - in the timber processing sectors (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper manufacturing, publishers and printing presses did not change.
The other sectors of the processing industry saw a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water that represent a significant weight within domestic trade, an increase of 0.3 per cent in August was an increase of 0.3 per cent, first of all as a result of the effect of the increase in official prices from July 1.
In a 12-month comparison - in domestic sales of processing industry sectors - the biggest price increase was in the petrochemical sector (32.4 per cent).
In the metal processing sector, an increase of 13.2 per cent was observed, while in the food, beverage and tobacco industry, which was decisive, there was an increase of 11 per cent.
There was a decrease in prices in the textile industry (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machines and instruments (0.3 per cent).
In the rest of the processing sectors, the pace of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
Over the past year in the processing industry globally, prices rose 10.2 per cent.
Electricity prices, gas, heat and water supplies exceeded prices of the previous year by 18.7 percent.
In August, among the different sectors of domestic trade, the largest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) was recorded in the investment goods sectors.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, in the prices of the energy sector and the intermediary sectors, there was no change from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month last year, the largest price increase occurred in the energy sectors and the intermediate industry (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer product branches there was a decrease of 6.8 per cent and investment goods by 1.4 per cent.
Industry export prices calculated at HUF were up 1.1 percent from the previous month, and compared with 12 months, there was a 3.9 percent decline.
The price of our national currency in a month fell by 1.7 percent against the euro and 7.1 percent against the dollar, compared to August 2007 it strengthened with 7.5 percent against the euro and 15.9 percent against the dollar.
Willn't you need a visa to go to the United States anymore next year?
Kinga Goncz believes that there is a good chance of the entry into force about the US-Hungarian agreement on visa waiver - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, to the Hungarian residents there.
In his opinion, "practically everything depends on the construction on time on the other side of the Atlantic of the Atlantic the electronic system of access and control."
At the same time he warned that the entry award will disappear in the new system, but tourists before leaving the country of origin must register.
From today the head of Hungarian diplomacy is in talks in Washington.
He will meet Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice handing the Median Cross with the Man of Merit Star of the Republic of Hungary and hold negotiations with the international policy advisers of presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the banks' financial bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, secured support on Sunday for the administration's $700 million bank aid program, instead politicians demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, following several marathon-type negotiations, announced in the early morning of Sunday, an agreement on the banks' financial rescue package.
The financial package aimed at resolving the Wall Street crisis and defrosting the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, when economic issues came to the fore, Obama regained some advantage and McCain's advantage disappeared after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin's candidacy for vice presidency.
At a Detroit campaign rally last Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress will quickly pass the $700 billion package bill.
He stressed that the proposal includes those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and responsibly (...) the employment, savings of you are also in danger of whole industries and the stability of the whole economy," he said to a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not miss the opportunity to describe McCain's economic concepts as obsolete.
In an interview with ABC McCain explained that "we will all swallow this barely (...) but doing nothing is simply not a viable path."
The Republican senator said the proposal includes the establishment of a control committee to the minister of fineness and the limitation of executive compensation, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain played no major role in the consultations, but instead consulted with the minister on a daily basis.
Congressional President Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that congressmen will likely vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group the most conscious voters became, says Der Spiegel on the CSU's weak election result in Bavaria.
Haider and his supporters are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red-haired coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the left-wing German magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Devours His Parents" analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the grieving duo Beckstein-Huber had taken office.
Social Christians have been developing Bavaria for several decades - and now these modern citizens are the ones who turn their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that had already been expected for almost ten years was over: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU earned 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. even during Stoiber's much-mentioned era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents .
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years now, but at pace they were very wrong. However, the secularization, results of education and settlement of the Northern Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had negative consequences for the fidelity of CSU voters.
Modernisation also increases the potential and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself became the most conscious, most critical and more stubborn voters.
It is surprising that in recent weeks it was precisely the conventional groups of the citizens who moved the most away from the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrialists, those who have high school and the graduates.
This resulted in less than 40 percent support for the CSU.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative newspaper in Vienna: "Who with whom? In his article entitled "Party presidents are very reserved on coalition issues" - he deals with the confusing situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
The SP wants to negotiate with the VP.
The VP prohibits the SP from meddling in its internal affairs.
The BZ is open in all directions to negotiate, the Greens are not yet to consult on the coalition.
Elections have already been held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, party leaders barely let them see any of their decks.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SP, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the VP.
The SP wants to show that it is possible to collaborate between the two parties - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left pending the question that if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the VP, in the post of vice chancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the era of Schsssel-Molterer.
This political trend cannot be followed.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offerings.
He said cooperation will surely not be successful if Faymann tries to meddle in the internal affairs of the VP.
It is still open in the party if they will elect the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must certainly be discussed, within the VP itself.
The president of the BZ, J.rg Haider, was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to take responsibility for the government," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, its host is France, which this year is also the current president of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party for Fidesz, in her message to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that plague Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was inaugurated - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for jobs, social affairs and equal opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of the governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organisations for the protection of social rights.
Járóka - according to the press bureau of the group of Fidesz Members in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma are left out of the labour market in the first place because of their low level of schooling.
"Most young Roma have not completed secondary education and because of the poor quality of basic education, only an insignificant part can obtain a university diploma."
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investment in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, these issues need to be made a wide awareness among Gypsies and among non-gypsies.
The sooner a gypsy student starts school, the more likely they will have to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumer taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"To the Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be assured of the right for quality education and guarantee the abolition of segregated and low-level education," said Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to immediately accelerate the processes of school desegregation, for this the proper implementation of the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is of fundamental importance.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, Roma children must be given the possibility that guarantees democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights," Járóka demanded.
The objective of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organised annually since last year's Berlin meeting, which was held in the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities," is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level in the Member States.
Fox in the chicken coop
In the United States, life and health insurance companies when they see the data on the purchase of the drug, often deny signing an insurance contract.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are personal data protection programmes, which in the use of prescription data in all cases is linked to the approval of the given person.
He himself must be in independent hands, because if not, "we trust the chicken coop to the fox" - the Washington Post quotes Richard Dick, designer of the medical prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies make the price of insurance and the amount of compensation to the customer's state of health and if they believe the risk is excessive, they simply don't make the contract.
They previously sent the client to medical control and signed the contract with him knowing the outcome of the control.
Dick ten years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: with the customer identification number he easily gets the list of medicines purchased in the last year and a half of the pharmacies and the program itself draws the conclusion on the customer's diseases and state of health.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that the level of fat in the blood is practically incurably high, so it is immediately included in a higher risk category.
Numerous versions of the program circulate, some even establish a risk number, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has little to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is, for example, that some medicines are multipurpose, for example certain substances serve both to treat headaches and heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is a major risk-enhancing factor for insurance companies while the former are not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process this data, which, before acquiring the necessary information from the pharmacies, request the patient's approval.
The authorities already force them on this, although they have not received a fine for negligence so far.
Some companies have recently also produced the results of laboratory tests and by joining them with drug use data, obtaining more accurate information about the patient's state of health.
More and more companies have access to this data and simultaneously it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those providing health services.
The bill that gives the right to the authority for the control of specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: he therefore developed his program, which will require the person's specific approval to provide his own personal data.
It is another issue that such a person cannot deny his approval, because otherwise insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the chickens, however, are exposed to the fox's goodwill.
CSU: Grace for a transitional period
A decision on the fate of the failed Huber-Beckstein duo will be made in late October
Despite the serious electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut at the top of the Bavarian CSU, for the time being the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, party president and Genther Beckstein, provincial prime minister, are still in their posts, but it is not known how long the grace will last.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent electoral defeat, will be decided at the party's extraordinary congress on the last weekend of October.
The members of the much-criticized duo glimpsed: they don't hold on to their posts so much.
This sought to reassure the furious members of their parliamentary group and their grassroots organization, who, a day after the "Tunami Bavarian," demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - albeit under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career - the social Christian union reached 60.7 per cent, instead now, a year after the beaten-up against Stoiber, they got just 43.4 per cent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria that gives 18 percent of German GDP.
Although in the province of the South, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, the Conservatives continue to dominate, in the future they will undoubtedly have to coalition with someone.
As a first sign of the party's restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, federal agriculture minister, one of Huber's potential successors, also holds a seat in the small intelligence group that begins negotiations with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Elects over a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that on the list of Free Electors comes into parliament that Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was taken advantage of for the coup of the duo Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly erased the ambitious local policy from the stage.
The top leaders of the CSU are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition, too, will take an active role Stoiber, who has so far been moving the ropes in the background, the former provincial head of government and former CSU president described September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his view would have deserved far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and for Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the Bundestag's September 2009 election, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor if they are unable to enhance together the CSU, which played a momentous role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could hardly hide her disappointment at the failure, the CSU's losses will not have a negative impact on the Great Berlin coalition.
Which is naturally relative: it won't be easier to treat the wounded CSU and the social democrats' crisis continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent hit its worst since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0
After Sunday's election, there will be no opposition MP in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability guaranteed in Alexandr Lukashenko, on the other hand, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is rather explained by violations of the law committed during the vote count.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election result.
Although the country's legislature of 10 million inhabitants, made up of 10 and ten deputies, has no opposition more than a decade ago, before yesterday's elections the united opposition under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) expected Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his term after the 2006 elections of doubtful legitimacy, as a result of the amendment of the Constitution this time "allowing" the entry of some opposition deputies into parliament.
So the SDGZ suppressed the boycott it originally wanted to do.
At the heart of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which took credit for moderating the increasingly expensive natural gas import from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of the Belgian Transgaz, owner of the pipeline that passes through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not give Lukashenko permission to leave and the other high-level politicians because it has a political regime considered anti-democratic.
It was a sign of detente when the OSCE, in assessing the election campaign, placed emphasis rather on positive phenomena rather and not on mistakes - such as the ban on taxing a third of opposition candidates.
However, Monday's Senate report of the OSCE criticized even the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the vote count.
With all this in the opinion of the opposition, there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abhasia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has been considered the two regions as independent.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun," Alexandr Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to maintain this situation, even though "the regime fears allowing even an opponent to enter that weightless parliament."
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations when they see the results, rather it tries to convey to voters its message about the need for economic reforms.
"This clearly causes us many problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities are hindering their distribution, but even so I see that more and more support change among the elderly as well," Milinkevich said, referring to the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main outcome is the creation of social security, does not consider it appropriate not even retirees, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Because of the country's indebtedness and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time for the breakdown of social security that "looks like the silence of the cemeteries," Milinkevich said.
Russian observers, opposed to the opposition politician, described the election as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in deeds," so that the lack of the opposition is nothing more than the testimony of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Marseille's global menu
The European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are mutually trading partners, this issue, in addition to the other largely global problems, dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, to discuss mainly cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic power in development that should have more voice and vote in international affairs but member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been addressed at the ninth summit that began yesterday in Marseilles.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU President José Manuel Barroso President of the Commission and Javier Solana as the main foreign policy representative, received Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, i.e. to increase their trade exchange to more than 100 billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 goods trading increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious target.
This was legally harmonized with India &apos; s 26 bilateral civil aviation conventions, so air transport will also be able to fly in the future.
India until the end of 2009 wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The objective is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among the Union's trading partners.
The summit paid its attention to global issues.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of the latter - and pressed the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also appreciated, although both sides have a great responsibility for their failure.
The EU confirmed that it will hold on to its energy and climate programme, i.e. until 2020 it wants to reduce polluting emissions by at least 20 percent.
India also agrees with this, as with next year's climate conference, a global agreement should be reached and greenhouse gas production reduced by 50 per cent to 50.0%.
They also want to hinder rising food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - at a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris hopes that French companies will receive orders worth 20 billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency news reports, the deal would be for a 15-year period.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers to the Frankfurt book international exhibition.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international exhibition of the Frankfurt book awaits for this edition more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition with more than 403 thousand titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
He will be the undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the opening ceremony of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
A meeting with the print will follow at the Struktur Room in the Buchmesse pavilion 5.0: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and prospects for the status of publishers in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign authors' books gradually decreases over the total Italian production, and in particular for adults and adolescents.
Brunette: "From now on more you have breakfast before you start work"
It has never happened in the history of Chigi Palace that put on automatic doors to control the entry and exit of the staff.
But from today it starts with this measure against whoever signs and then goes to the bar to have a coffee during work hours.
This novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Automatic doors," says Brunetta, "are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services," says the minister.
"A new season of accountability and transparency is now opening.
This is reformism," Brunetta stresses again.
The installation in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council is completed with Chigi Palace.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view."
No resistance has been found on the part of the employees, says the secretary general: "It has been a change shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of the workers."
In short, no more breakfast in working hours; no more coffee and half-moons.
Brunette's Word, which he suggests, smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand."
During a convention at the Public Administration High School
From Rome, the minister declares that "in three months the absences due to diseases of public employees have been reduced by 50%, that means 60,000 more people to work in a year."
And he adds that the Public Administration needs to be more effective
"which wage dynamics," explains the minister, in the last 8-10 years, have been double with respect to the private sector and well above the inflation burden."
For now, millions of public employees have come together to oppose the rules of the Brunette decree by adhering to the petition supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Civil Service shows the numbers, the lower absenteeism of work due to causes of illness," writes the association of consummaters - the people of the 'wage workers' are constantly increasing.
There are indeed millions in Italy the right and productive public administration employees who have joined together to declare war on the illegitimate rules of the decree."
In particular, the Tar will answer the exclusion of financial treatments added due to the cause of service; the extension of the time belts in which the medical control visits of the sick employee are carried out , and other aspects contained in the new provisions beloved by the minister.
Work Accidents, Napolitano: "Crutical prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents are verified at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently invalid.
By 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths from homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of the accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic news these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of the Anmil, National Association maimed and invalidated by work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of State draws his "great appreciation for the constant associative commitment to prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of victims and the awareness of public opinion."
"It has been manifested, a 'enough', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, due to their dimensions, arouse the cry of the media and the participation of public opinion, on the other hand, the daily reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particular significance takes the many initiatives promoted in the school environment for more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep attention to the phenomenon alive, not to curb alarm about social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the President of the House Gianfranco Fini stressed "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitute an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all the institutions a determined commitment to put an urgent end."
"The data on accidents at work seems to point to a slight positive approach, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is equally impressive," said Anmil president Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not really want this "decrease trend" to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention decreases that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at a general level too little is done to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
In our opinion - Mercandelli has emphasized - greater controls and inspections are necessary, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school."
"It serves a further effort," he added, "as concerns the communication and awareness of public opinion.
But it certainly serves a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers to a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary guardianship provided for the victims of work" and the "care diversion to which the system is being directed in recent years."
"The objective is to restore to the worker the guarantee of insurance - he has added - because the fate of those who crash does not have to depend on the gift arranged by the legislator at a time."
Mp3 readers under accusation, put hearing at risk
Listening to music at high volume for a long period of time using portable music devices as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injuries.
The European Commission, which in a statement issued in Bruxel cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission on Emerging and recently identified health risk (Csrseri) of the Ue, published today, in a statement published in Bruxel.
"From this scientific opinion, read in the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day having the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of the hearing capacity."
"I'm concerned that such a high number of young people who often use portable music devices and cell phones at high acoustic level can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irremediably way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"There is a clear risk from scientific evidence - Ue liability emerges and we must react quickly.
What counts is sensitizing consummates and providing this information in the public domain.
We must also review existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are very effective and take the step with the new technology."
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the large use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that this originates.
"Scientists - concludes the executive Ue - they confirm that it is a matter of concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and the interested parties that measures could eventually be taken to better protect the children and the adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical apparatuses and related apparatuses."
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB, but concerns increase such as hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these damage by means of solutions such as reducing levels and exposure time to noise.
In his view, the Ue Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical devices listen at high volume (more than 89 decibels)music for just five hours a week exceed the current limit for maximum noise consented to at work.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of five years.
It means it affects 5-10% of the users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Alemanno gives the Commission the way for the future of the capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the timetable set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Fututo of the capital of Rome," which was established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Termas de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will discuss the main points for Rome.
Once the doors were closed in March, the board and the communal council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Piano for Rome with the "official bun" of the Municipality and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas - Alemanno tends to highlight.He must provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, can then endorse themselves.
There is no plenty of role position, only the will to have a place to draw up a great project for Rome.
In March the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise temporary finish.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome."
To those who accuse the Commission of useless, since its opinions are not binding, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that will be done in the Commission's degree and the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Almost always politics is crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that are back in return manifest.
On the contrary, we want to look further and in the long term, in a deeper prospect, working seriously to the development of Rome and its future."
The mayor of Rome also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, it is not a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to make the best minds that the capital squeezes participate and reason."
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic level leap, of which we have absolute need, thinking in a unitary spirit to its future."
A future that, the mayor of Rome says, "will not be limited only to the current communal confines but also looked beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of capital but "also considering the role that Rome can and must act as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama? The first president against American.
He has written an American political note that he is interested in going to be independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the U.S. economy and strained relations (as he also does today gives private citizenship) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as election date approaches
A Miami lady wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big stone face: he believes he won the highest office in the nation that has had two governors and five black senators."
They are actually attacks that don't say much; they are clearly racially attacks and do not answer the voters' question: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says Obama won and with a good advantage.
Here too, there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the south of the United States, has written an editorial: once in the booth to vote we will know well who the American patriot will vote.
A side of the American mentality is covered until the last.
"Whatever you want, we'll think then about where to put the cross, whether over Obama or about McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
Things never said before now, which seems almost certain to be the success of the black candidate.
Yet despite all these reasoning, the winning weapon for Democrats is George Bush.
They have asked 1500 people: what have been the mistakes made by Bush during his term? 89 percent have answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and kicked it home to the ass.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to make the bags.
Likewise, Iraq for the majority has been Bush's weak point.
Whoever will take over the George W seat will have a huge duty to unwrap.
Use, economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, "murder" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control for the future.
Today, however, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly declared feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated as once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to carry out the newspaper is a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism is not to be considered as understood by most of the public to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism predominates today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is following the wrong path.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The largest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many seen as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted they are embracing technology in the hope it will "make some good" for journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between the one who runs the newspapers - that is the directors and the journalists who work for them.
Fifty-six per cent of executives nationwide are sure their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23 per cent.
For some, this has to do with "work security."
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in three years are 47 percent nationally.
For the journalistic staff it is 30%.
The "safe job" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13 per cent of journalists work on a contract.
In an immense nation like the United States, with 300 million people and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet employers often offer what they want and thus becomes a matter of "take it or leave it,"
Directors are almost always well paid, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social security.
For the holidays, the reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by admission of their own, are "sickening" during the year.
It's all a matter of weather.
UNIPOL: ROMA COURT, DANILO COPPOLA WAS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the real estate company Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the realm of the counter-agreement investigation into the Unipol-Bnl escalation pact.
In the course of the arrest process in his charge, he last week has obtained the home release, transforming it into a compulsory residence for Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate company be able to travel the route from the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the pm has given the opposite vote) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the representatives' camera against the $700 million plan of salvation launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this one, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
The New York Times confirms yesterday informing us that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, always more divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, instead conservative, hostile to those of Washington, and the world of finance, strong in the Central and South states.
The soul, in fact, which has become arrogant with the vow of those who spoke at first.
This is hardly quoted is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, which the current economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here alone.
Whether in the United States as in Europe the crisis seems to function as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidify and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the refresher, the extraordinary revival, of the double state-sovereignty category in relation to a type of nationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking institutions - it would finance which have, yes, strong relations would finance abroad, but above all the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are compromised much more.
The one who immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is to say how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of the game or does not have much to say: the crucial test is The European Union that is divided as always between different interests and different state strategies cannot decide any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, of new rules and above all the subsidy of funds: from the moment the cut is only the state that possesses the economic resources and the mass of resources financed to remedy you.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two incalculable value resources, values in certain circumstances in which no market probably and no organization will ever have it to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the utmost importance provided that the new development of the economy tends to attribute to a very colliding factor to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of ever more sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that the global financing was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to do the accounts more and more with unimmaterial things such as water, crops and oil.
All things that, look, can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the earth but are equally united in absolute mode in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever is sovereign has many more letters about who is not, and to whom he has the misfortune of living in a post without crops, without oil and without water.
I get to the second novelty that but predicts a fracture.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says politics and leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of one who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leadership, of an economically relieved species inadequate with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of Western countries in a growing number.
Always more seems to be moving forward, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites so far on the rise, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the sympathetic exception of the end, to having made one's own time and to be stranger to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifest themselves in an "electoral return or in the sudden changes of collective moods of these last times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American congress against Bush (and also with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to do with it).
It is the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say any, will always make it more difficult to understand and then to represent, what is taking shape since today are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and agitates potentially excessively.
In front of all this, talking about a "mass rebellion" today is frankly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open certainly isn't.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Beat the laws of gravity thanks to a superglue and in the future walk on the walls like the spider man.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has gotten quite close.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to have glued a body of 100 kilos on a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the researcher's team is an evolution of existing ones using a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
The principle of the glue can be imagined as a series of tubes sorted like a pile of spaghetti, explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of geckos, covered in microscopic hairs that can ensure the animal a perfect grudge.
Tests on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful on the legs of this reptile and at the same time "easily takes off from the walls," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's engineering.
STOP FOR THE PAREDES? "This material could be useful as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk the walls exactly like the spider man? Layers do, but researchers think of much less fascinating use such as connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are heat and electric current conductors.
Other applications could have to do with aerospace engineering.
At the moment, no superheroes.
Another INVESTIGATION - Berkeley University in California is also engaged in the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal American Chemical Society, California scholars have presented an adhesive made of microfibers like hair that self-clean from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich with vitamins, if taken at the same time with some drugs, alters their absorption by amplifying or decreasing, as the case may be, efficiency with serious health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices are packaged that fresh are associated with the assumption of some doctors David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway to Philadelphia sends a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple is enough to reduce the absorption of some drugs, nullifying the beneficial effects and putting patients' health at risk.
Grapefruit juice was already low because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some antirhythmic medicinal products, antibiotics, anxiolytic, antihistamines and neurologicals.
The same Italian drug agency had given the news in an information bulletin two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mixture and paying attention to something being drowned in the case, such as Diasepam or Metadone.
NOT ONE ALSO - According to experts also orange juice and apple juice contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of the active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the call of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the State University of Milan:"These discoveries in general are pointed out to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide for changing the information notes of the same.
That is why we must always read the illustrative pamphlets of the medicinal products that are assumed and if there is something that is not clear to us, not to be impressed, to ask the doctor or the pharmacist clearly.
The Novel of Economy to Paul Krugman
The Nobel economics prize has been awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies, his trade models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Keynesian who teaches Princeton University and is a New York Times editorial note.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's decisions on the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001, Che quebro Enron days, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in endings of consequence for the United States.
A forecast that triggered much controversy and that for several years came to the economy, but that has now proved accurate.
"I am surprised and a little upset about how the memory of the scandal of the collapse of Enron and Worldcom have quickly disappeared from the attention of the public," Krugman had declared the 2002 fine.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European central bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist," but also a highly aggressive "very aggressive, particularly critical of the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration."
Open Office, echo the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft package."
It's the opening day of the OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that looks to attract ever more users, from home to office to public service professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After a nearly year-long work by volunteer developers, of which their backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several novelties: to the welcome screen and the less rude magazine interface, more consistent ones are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and the support for the new ODF format(Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also put to the multi-function with the Office 2007, Open Office suite is able to open the documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows to reduce the dimension of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via electronic post, or the possibility to import the PDF file in the graphing module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front can be created "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graph of Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or text processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in various users, avoiding the conflicts of the modifications, in the elaboration of texts, to each collaborator is given a color in the comment for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, over the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should deliver the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the Englishman who had been in the mirror since Friday.
In addition, for Windows and Mac OS, as the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request you can also send the installation cd to home or work.
And if the issue of free can be a hook for dissemination in houses, it is in business scope that Open Office the suite tests, tries the big bet, being able to already have several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there is not even a lack of realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, where business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, eats in the case of the well-known Access is the program that consents to work on the base data; and finally Draw the graphic module.
Target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that until today we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the departure of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Kohl is also positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case on the tour of France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third ranked and winner of the climber's best shirt.
To break the news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth positive runner to the third generation Epo, after Italians Riccardo Riccá and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also of the Gerolsteiner.
Tests by Kohl's blood champions come between those in recent weeks in Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry's lab.
If the counter-tests confirm that it is positive, the Austrian will lose third place to the Tour and anger against the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positive doping to the third generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told the Associated Press that he has notified the Austrian authorities of the news.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind the backs of Spaniard Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, awarding the top climber.
INMIGRANTS:NEW YORK TIMES SE PREGUNTA, ITALY IS RACISTA?
Italy's migrant country has recently become only a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with hostility.
Is this transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? That's what the New York Times wonders in a long article that has dedicated to the debate on the subject of racism in Italy based on the case of the young Abdul William Guibre native of Burkina Faso murdered last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case shows what the New York Times defines the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" are recorded, but also the highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support of the North League."
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
The new legislation dear to the Lega also tightens the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestines is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Tendency marked by the Pope that by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano finding Benedetto XVI in Congress has asked that the State and the church work together to combat racism."
Steve Fossett plane found the missing millionaire a year ago
The wreckage of Steve Fossett's plane, the missing millionaire on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris has been found on a high plateau at 3,000 meters high, in the area of the Nevada mountain area of Mammoth Lakes, in the confines between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Wood County Commissioner John Anderson has allayed the doubts that remained: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squadron, and now we have confirmed that it is typical of what Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance," he said at a stamp conference.
The sheriff has specified that no human remains have been found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The millionaire, 63, was given dead in February.
The American transport safety office(Ntsb) has made it known that a few hours after the sighting of the remains, a squadron of investigators has been sent that has identified the device: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, scattered since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal remains have been found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents named after Fossett, the two issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
The search for Fossett had been halted a month after he disappeared.
The millionaire had won a position in history thanks to a long series of scoops.
In 2002, the sixth-placed, he had become the first man to complete the world's turn in a hot air balloon: two lonely flying weeks.
Three years later he had made the world turn by plane and non-stop.
Among his records, also that for having flown at 15,445 meters above the Andes, but with a co-driver.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A Suv outside the schemas with an original and well-established design with defined lines and specific angles.
This is, in short, Glk the last born among the "compacted" all-terrain vans of the star's house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Owned by the content out of the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that will accompany the launch of the suv Glk, available in the exhibition halls Mercedes-Benz from October 17.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car will launch an unprecedented form of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that dominates the central street of Milanese shopping, Como Avenue, until November 15.
The phase premium of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue As it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the image you will have the impression that the car will leave outside the poster.
Successively, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed in a single image.
Mercedes with this advertising is certainly trying to introduce something new to the stereotype of car communication.
Will this formula be able to capture the interest of future buyers?
It is clear who the Italian hooligans are
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sports demonstrations is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian National for years and which until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival's fans either.
The group's extraction is right.
The promoters are from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste e Udine.
To these of Sofia have been added a small group (few units, in fact) of the Campaign and Apulia.
They have three-colored flags where the militants' hometown appears: Saturday night they have been taken out so they are not identified.
English fans are inspired.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of the Levski.
Figc had made 144 tickets available to Italian fans for the match - all already with the names, so easily controllable.
And the interior minister had already controlled them all: among what they had left for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, none that had forbidden him to frequent a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have been refused the ticket and also the trip.
Now the Ministry of the Interior hopes to read the acts that come from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to fanatics who have been arrested or who has been identified in the disorder.
An international Daspo (a ban on access to sporting events) that prevents frequenting not only Italian stadiums but also those from all over Europe.
Our hooligans, they'll be no more in a stadium.
Lucky.
But now there is the fear of imitation: that those who are not fifty others will be added.
"We have to put out this fire right away and not legitimize who behaves in this way," they say of the Ministry of the Interior.
That's why "well-opened eyes" especially in view of Wednesday's National party in Lecce."
In Apulia there is also a small nucleus of Ultras Italia bras.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams that can also have a section of the Aise (information agency and external security, that is, the secret service, which deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"The choirs of Duce-Duce and the arm raised during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria is a reato ...."
This is the thought (expressing in a happy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken the position that was formerly of Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of Trieste of public safety where there is a core of supporters from the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not reato to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behaviour of those 150-200 fans that has been embarrassing.
"I do not do the sociologist, adds the Observatory's No.1 - the reats are attributed in the countries where the event happens.
So far this group had behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles of Mameli's anthem: they are also not a reato, but if they allow they are not of education...."
Students who are victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a room
The rental market for university students is unaware of the crisis.
According to the latest Sunia survey, the tenants' union, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 euros in Florence, 650 to Naples, 600 to Rome.
"the phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people because of the very high costs that the family would have to bear," explains the head of the Sunia studio office, Laura Mariani, in these cities, the strong demand has completely deformed the market to such an extent that it triggers a process of widespread increase for residents."
In addition, in most cases rental offers contain a number of violations: free-type contracts, not registered, without fee limit, sub-renute linked rents.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are needed that, through the review of tax taxation, prices can be regulated.
Looking in detail at the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in a Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria zone).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and 370 to 500 for one single.
In Rome in the central areas near the University(San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) you are asked for approximately 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas near other universities(Ostiense and Cinecitt).
Economy is made only if peripheral area is changed: 300 euros for a bed and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina area, Centocelle and surrounding areas.
In Naples for a bed you are served 300/450 euros, for a room you are spent from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari by a bed you are served 250/350 euros, at least 350 per individual.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute finishes, but it has a greater weight in the city's economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of rents to students and non-EUs is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: a 25/30% increase in the fee for foreign students compared to Italians.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema, the city cancels the historic halls
Historical cinemas close favoring Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas in a blind city, it's like an eyeless face".
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore photographs effectively what is happening in the great Italian urban centers and also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalizing cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticons on the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the monkey halls in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memoir," which a friend, an acquaintance with whom a piece of place and so much excitement died.
The figures given by Anec, the main association of traders, speak clearly: in the last five years they have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and to pay most are mostly the rooms of the main cities: 10 fewer in Florence, 9 fewer in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 fewer in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most suffered by the closures are as the first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 fewer cinemas, following by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the person responsible for his disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these three Italian regions are their own that have recorded the largest number of new metic cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 either in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
The Italian exercise has been irrationally developed. observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it would be useful for new structures to be built but it would be necessary to ensure the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its frequenters are willing to transfer to the meticons.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favour of traders: the state's previous debt is approximately 10 million euros.
It is shameful from an ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To support the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
Interesting in the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to worry about the closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the cinema mono room is in the historic center that on the periphery.
Among the rules envisaged are tax facilitation measures in favour of managers and advantages for the public in mobility finishes: spectators will be able to enter the limited traffic zone and will have special parking fees.
It's an initiative I like. Giuseppe Tornatore observes" and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna by setting other measures.
It is true that in contrast to the extra power of the meths, the traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that was always important for me: the closing of Bagheria's cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "New Paradiso cinema," which I had already thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass ahead to the Rialto or the Quirinale of Nazionale road already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, so as not to see the posters blackened by the dust, I turn to the other side.
The link between politics and 'ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniform the elections of the Municipality for those interested in the cosca Piromalli."
They are heavy accusing them that the magistrates of the Calabrian Anti-Mafia Directorate give the mayor and deputy mayor of Goia Taorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by mafia association.
Also arrested Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, the same name of the boss, already convicted by mafia criminal association and to compensate 10 million euros.
"Despising any legal and moral standards, and in a good sense," the prosecutors write, the two local governments had expressed a willingness to pay for consultations with lawyer Piromalli.
"The mafia family would have been allowed to write the judges - to officially enter the municipality's intern facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional board Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreement between the bad organized life there is a lot" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who stay clean'.
Those arrested this morning are added to those of the last July after police had announced the cut of the heads of the Mafia family Piromalli.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had dissolved, already in 1991 and always due to alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been lifted from the commission to manage the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor, of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, after the balloting in May 2006, had been elected as head of a center-right coalition.
I explore a scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call the deputy interior minister in case who at the time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything on a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 road project.
From the interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, "a willingness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the elections of the civil service over the interests of mafia families," emerges.
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones come down to the stage
It is an exterminated site that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now discovering it, the world's big energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the big ones like Chevron look.
The possibility of collecting energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, together with the first oil crisis, investigations intensified.
When the price of oil fell low in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was set aside, but now that cases of the environment and the new rise in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated by 2007 that 15 percent of the global electricity need could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of the waves of the sea.
This amount would be double that produced by nuclear power plants today.
And then there would be the currents and the tides.
Giants to attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy, it is always more and among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the technology on ocean energy," said the spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil colossus to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal and is assessing the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the U.S. energy commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a fairly important sign, if you consider that in Alaska the United States continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to carry out new drilling.
In addition to Chevron is New York's Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey's Ocean Power to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, even if they are not detailed indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts are talking about a technology still at the beginning, because marine energy has no doubt it has a great environmental impact.
For now, impacts such as those or the Scots are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce long-scale energy, technology with greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boas attached between them.
The strength of the waves, which move the boas up and down, turns into hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
Pressure spins a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is shipped to the coast via submarine cables.
For now there are four implants of this type in development, pending only federal approval, apart from the energy, could serve for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a mall and for a parking lot, using underwater turbines on New York's East River.
The movement of water when there are tides, spins the pallets of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant said it has a long cast of customers waiting for the necessary authorisations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electric Power, at the moment deserves the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is mainly about tidal energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others approaching the coast, have invested $7.5 million in 2008 and an investment of $35 million is planned for 2009.
