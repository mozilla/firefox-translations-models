Did you ever imagine what to call or name someone who has no name or surname?
Hey.
You go.
That word that identifies us so much to the Argentines, "che."
But I'm thinking of someone else who doesn't have a name or surname.
I'm thinking of that someone who lost his name and last name, who disappeared his name and surname, his identity.
Now in Argentina people are disappearing.
In the world, now at this time, thousands of people are disappearing.
Some are missing who are alive, the product of child trafficking, baby theft, human trafficking, illegal adoptions.
Others are missing who have died: kidnappings, wars, narcoviolence, terrorist attacks, natural accidents and others not so natural.
It is necessary to return your identity, rewrite your first and last name.
Because we all have an identity, we have an individuality, an identity of individual, affective, family, cultural, group, country, but we also have a genetic identity.
Our identity is written in our genes.
Our genome, the human genome, is made up of four letters that are repeated 3000 million times.
Unbelievable.
But we're almost the same.
Almost the same.
To be exact, our genome is 99.9 % identical between us.
Only 0.1% of our genome allows us to distinguish or identify ourselves.
However, 0.1 per cent of 3000 million letters is no less than three million letters and that is a number.
You can write some books with three million letters.
And that's what it's all about, using the letters of our genome, rewriting the letters of the name and surname of those who lost their identity.
How do we do that?
Using genetics, comparing.
Identifying necessarily is to compare.
To compare a father and son, to find out if they are linked in that kinship, I have to compare them.
And to know that there is a proportion of those letters that they have in common according to that kinship.
In the 1980s, I was working at the Hospital de Clínicas, on the genetics of transplants, seeking maximum genetic compatibility between donors and organ receptors to avoid graft rejection.
And you'll wonder, and what does that have to do with identity?
It has to do and a lot.
And how much.
Because our organism, our immune system, is deeply xenophobic.
He self-esteems as such and is tolerated and rejects everything strange.
And that's why we reject a virus, a bacteria, the more we're going to reject an entire organ.
That's why we were looking for those compatibility, to avoid those rejections.
But also those genes allowed us, precisely because we did it among related relatives, analyze and establish kinship bonds.
We had a problem in the '80s: we needed living cells from the two people we were going to compare, we couldn't analyze a bone.
That was a stumbling block.
But a decade later a revolution came to the labs: now we could compare molecules.
We could extract molecules from a living cell, or dead, and compare them.
Then we took a step forward and then we could identify a dead cell inside a boned body or rest.
And we gained some experience.
A decade later, precisely in 2003, something happened that changed my life, largely in the professional and also in motivation.
A group of women and men, anthropologists and anthropologists, from the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team who were walking through Argentina, exhumanized graves, looking for causes of death, analyzing those bones, trying to identify them and restore them to families, came to Cordoba.
They were walking not only in Argentina, but in many countries around the world.
And they arrived in Cordoba to exhume a massive grave in the municipal cemetery of San Vicente.
A mutual friend gathered us at his house.
What did we do?
What many Argentines do when we got together: we ate a roast and there was wine too.
And then, having a few glasses of wine, I was shocked by the stories these anthropologists told me because the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team is an NGO that works on cases of universal human rights violations trying to identify people.
They told me stories from all countries, but there, at that meeting, in that roast with that wine, we realized that they were in a hurdle, there was a stalemate, they needed to incorporate a new technology into this complex process of identification and it was genetics.
So we thought about joining forces and doing something in common.
I remember that at that time we set out, let us try with the worst preserved rest of the pit of San Vicente, with the rest more degraded, more deteriorated.
If we do well with that one, we're probably gonna do well with the others.
And we did very well.
And the first identification of a bone rest of the dictatorship in Argentina emerged, in the pit of San Vicente in Córdoba.
That filled us with joy and we said, "Let's put a lab" and that's how it was done.
We set up a genetic lab where there are young guys who are working, I know, very much.
And we started walking, we summoned family members, we started crossing letters to rewrite names.
But not only in Argentina, because in Argentina we produced some identifications, others from the cemetery of San Vicente, of the center of torture and death of "La Perla," the identification of some of the founding mothers of Plaza de Mayo, who had been thrown into the sea and that the sea had returned them.
We also went out to walk the road they were walking: Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, where dictatorships and names and identities disappeared.
And further north, in Central America, El Salvador, the war of the 1980s, and even further north, in today's Mexico, where thousands of migrants disappear every year from many countries, which crosses Mexico, want to reach the dream of the northern country.
Also on other continents, Africa, for example, South Africa that imprisoned Mandela.
And in Asia.
It looks all wonderful, doesn't it?
Everything went well for us.
But it's not.
A lot of times we stay in the middle.
Many times we have the remains, but it has been so many years that family members are gone.
And other times we have the relatives, but the remains are not found.
And other times, even having the remains, they are so deteriorated that we cannot decipher the letters to compare them with relatives.
That really generates great frustration.
I'm sure they know a highly known, very famous, popular TV series: CSI New York, Los Angeles, Miami.
In these series, the researchers, in hours, days, solve very difficult cases.
That's not true, that's fiction.
The reality is another.
We call that "CSI effect" because they generate a distorted image of the complex identification process.
Most worryingly, they don't just do it on people, but some government authorities also believe it's so easy.
On top of that they are all models.
The reality of ours... (Laughter) It's a little different.
(Laughter) (Laughs in the public) (Laughter) (Applause) I'm remembering about four or five years ago, it was my turn to participate in a call that we had made in Mexico to relatives.
It was a call to a number of families who came to donate their blood samples to make a blood bank and compare the data to the amount of graves that were being discovered.
It was a very solemn atmosphere.
The relatives were serious, they came to donate their blood samples.
At one point, I finished taking a mother's sample.
He stopped.
I was gonna put his hand out to give it to him.
I looked at her, she was small, very native, dressed in her typical suit.
I reached out my hand and she took it with both of me and brought it here like this and said, "Doctor, please find me."
(Sigh) That request is a mandate.
That request-mandate is that it is worth insisting on and insisting on those complex cases that we cannot solve.
Obsessively insist to try to produce a new identity, so that you can rewrite a name again, return it to a family, end the years of waiting, uncertainty, anguish and so that that little mother can meet her son again, even as her son is dead.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) (Ovation)
When I was five and I was beginning to read, my dear grandfather Carlos Felipe gave me an adventure book.
"The Microbes Hunters," by Paul de Kruif.
In its chapters were Leeuwenhoek, Spallanzani, Koch, the bacillus's, Pasteur, men who with rudimentary microscopes sought to defeat the invisible enemy.
The book did not awaken in me the vocation for medicine or chemistry, but my passion for history did.
And, as a frequent traveller to the past, I wanted to tell you some of the pandemics that plagued humanity.
We could talk about the fierce anger of the second half of the 19th century, or the smallpox that cost so much to dominate.
But there are two pandemics that were severely marked by their fatal consequences.
In the 14th century, black plague, caused by a lice that moved in rats.
It began in Asia and from there it passed to Venice, the most cosmopolitan port of its time.
That's how he got into Europe.
The death toll was between 25 and 50 million.
From four Europeans to one took the plague.
The numbers in Asia were quite similar.
Closer in time, in the 20th century, the century of flu, we had in 1918 the Spanish flu.
Spanish flu that began in the U.S. with American soldiers preparing to go at the end of World War I and that infected the towns of the ports of France where they embarked.
From there it spread all over the continent.
He started in the U.S. and arrived in Europe for France.
Why do we tell you Spanish flu?
Well, that was a "fake news".
The government and the Spanish press decided to face the evil by putting the statistics on the surface.
Because of this sincerity of the data and the numbers, they ended up being identified as responsible for something that did not correspond to them.
On that occasion one in five infected died.
Look, in World War I, between 10 and 30 million people died.
Universal flu killed 50 million.
The world's population declined by between 2.5 per cent and 5 per cent because of that pandemic.
We talked about anger, smallpox, black plague, universal flu and we could also add yellow fever, from 1871, which hit the cities of Corrientes and Buenos Aires.
What did they all have in common?
That when they attacked us we weren't warned.
We weren't ready.
To top it off, in many cases it was not known where the contagion came from.
Therefore, the answers and reactions were not effective in countering evil.
What did we learn from all those fatalities?
Something very important, that the danger of the virus is enhanced by disinformation.
I'll explain.
In the 14th century, instead of dealing with rats and lack of hygiene, it was argued that the sinful lifestyle of many had unleashed divine anger.
In the 20th century, instead of showing the true causes of that flu, reality was distorted and the bug was out of control.
In this way it spilled over the five continents.
Therefore, we may have learned once and for all that we must handle ourselves with the truth.
As much as it hurts.
Another big teaching at the time was that we're going to have to keep on guard even after the storm passes.
Because there have always been second and third waves that have taken the unsuspecting.
But above all, we can venture wonderful times of growth.
Because after the black plague came the Renaissance.
Because after the universal flu came the 1920s, the most fruitful and avant-garde of all time.
Yeah, at the end of the tunnel, the sun is waiting for us.
Thank you.
I have two passions: one, football.
I'm a megafan, see if you guess what equipment?
(Laughter) Of course I am Real Madrid megafan.
I am also a goalkeeper in the Villanubla soccer team.
The other passion is: computers, video games and programming, which is what I come to talk about today.
When playing, the children drive the Wii, the PSP, the Nintendo crazy.
We always try to earn some extra games, finishing duties first, sorting our room, whatever it is for moving on to the next level or overcoming our previous score.
One day I thought: What if instead of just playing those games I could create my own screens, heroes and bad ones, punches and pirouettes, extra lives?
Impossible?
No, no.
A child my age can do it.
While new technologies are everywhere and the older ones you use them for elder things, to see... -- computers on board cars (although my parents sometimes keep missing), mobile phones, email, send messages, shop, browse the Internet -- the children use them to play, that for that we are children and that's what we like most.
But we all know that we, the children, are given much better, how to say it?, those demon apparatuses than many elders, perhaps because we are not afraid to touch them, to experiment with them, to see what is here or to spoil them, since then there are the parents to fix everything.
(Laughter) This curiosity that we have the kids helped me to be a creator of my own games and I realized I could learn by playing and playing learning.
I could experience, create, share, understand and reason how things are done and then use it with what we were studying.
And it turns out that all that I was learning is what the older people call "creative information."
Once they told me that programming is like a play: we have our stage where our actors are who will act with each other as we tell them, we can disguise them to get animations or add images, sounds, etc. You'll think: it looks very good, but a child alone, in his room, programming, is not very social to say.
But it's much more.
It is a public community and open worldwide, to which we can belong and where we can publish our programs or download the programs already made to play with them, see how they have done them, modify or improve them.
And it is that, at present, in this community there are more than 10,000 shared programmes, and to it we belong children, not so children, and teachers from schools, institutes and universities.
I was getting more and more passionate about it.
I made new friends with whom I shared creations, and I thought that, if I taught it to the school kids, they could enjoy it as I did.
In addition, programming also helped me learn in a more fun way what we were giving at school.
So I was clear.
Last year, when we were giving the bones of the human body in class, it occurred to me to do a question-and-answer game, which is this: (Video) I'm going to teach you this game I did about the bones of the human body for my school, when we were giving it last year, in which the human body asks you where its bones are.
We give the green flag, put it on the big screen to make it look better, and it says, "Where is the jaw?"
You have to answer with the right number, if it's 10, 11, 1, 2, 3... you answer with the 10 that is the right one and it says, "Get together" but if you respond badly it says, "ua, ua, ua."
The sounds I have recorded and added them to the game as well, and I have made there be successes and failures, that here puts the numbers of the successes and the failures so that I can do competitions with my friends to see who knows best the bones of the human body.
(Applause) I had so much fun programming and it helped me so much to learn that I told my teacher and asked if we could see him in class, that I wanted to show it to everyone.
And so it was.
We organized a day when I taught those projects and more to my classmates and taught them that they could do it as they had done as I had.
Since it couldn't be otherwise, they loved it.
Children and teachers liked it so much that this year we founded the programming club "The Moor of Villanubla," where there are already 26 children who enjoy and schedule programs individually or as a team.
Now I'm preparing this game about space: (Video) I'm going to show you this game I've done on the planets of the solar system with the video sensor, in which you have to hit the planets with your head so they don't fall into the sea.
We put it on a big screen.
I've made mistakes and successes and here's the sea.
The planets are falling and you aim for the camera, you move and give them.
When you give them, you change the planet to its name and says it, and you add a hit.
But when you don't give them the sound of the water, it adds a flaw.
Well, I think you've seen how it works.
(Applause) Is he very cool?
Well, I did it and that's nice to me.
I'm also going to pass it on to the 5-year-olds from my school who are doing a program on the planets of the solar system and I'm sure everyone will learn with it and that makes me feel happier because I know that my games serve more things than to have fun with myself.
But this isn't the first time I've done something for the kids at my school.
As my parents saw that I liked him so much and I was doing so well with the studies, when I turned 7 they gave me one thing that when I saw it I said, what is this?
A wire?
And they said, "With those wires you're going to be able to do magic".
And they were right and I'm going to show you today.
It was a plaque called Makey Makey that when connecting it with a cable to the computer you could be puncturing more cables to things as original as gums, plastiline, fruits, pencil graphite, water or, just touching them, make programs and games magically work.
I told Marga, the 4-year-old teacher at my school and asked me if we could do a special project on the music and instruments of an orchestra.
The children and their professors would be in charge of making the instruments of cardboard and eva rubber, while I had to do the necessary programs for those instruments to come to life and sound real.
So I told Juanje, a friend of mine, and between the two of us got to work.
We found it a very interesting project, but it was a very difficult challenge because we had to make very young children listen to us, other children.
When we had everything prepared we brought all the kids together from the children's cycle and taught them how their instruments really sounded.
We even taught them that they also had music inside.
It was amazing.
The little ones behaved great.
We organized them in shifts so that everyone could play their instruments.
Really, they looked at us like we were magicians who with simple wires and a computer had left little and old people speechless.
Well, do you want to see how we did it?
Well, I'll show you next.
Today I brought here some of those instruments, which, by the way, I thank my school for leaving them to teach you a little bit of that magic, and what any child could do with a little imagination, cables and a computer.
To play this super piano made by four-year-olds I have to take off my shoes.
I've got my feet clean, huh?
(Laughter) See if this song rings you.
(Music) (Applause) And now I'm going to show you how water can make more sounds than the one it does when it comes out of the tap.
This song I'm going to dedicate this song to my grandmother who for next week is going to be her birthday.
(Laughter) (Applause) (Applause) And then I'm going to need four volunteers because here and now we're going to see what they sound like.
Let's see, you four of you who are very close.
(Laughter) (Applause) Get out there, you take this one and you take this one.
Let's see what instrument you sound (Ruido) Come on, you sound like a noise.
(Sunsound) And you to some dishes.
No, you don't.
(Laughter) (Drum sound) You sound like a drum.
And you, see what instrument you sound to.
(horse hill smile) Uh, if a horse has sneaked in.
(Laughter) (Applause) I hope you liked everything I've told you.
See how you didn't cheat?
You imagine, create and share, and all with cables, a little imagination and a computer.
Cheer up, guys and girls.
Stop being just game players and become creators of stories, games, programs, musical projects...
There's no limit, just that of our imagination.
But don't stay there, teach it to the world, send it to the web so that we'll be more and more we enjoy, not only playing, but also knowing that we, the children, can also decide how we want things to be done.
And to you, the parents, I ask, please, to set up programming workshops in schools so that no child will run away from all this.
It's important for your children.
(Applause) And never forget and always believe that there is nothing impossible, everything depends on our effort and desire to overcome ourselves, and even if we are very small we also have many things to teach others.
Thank you very much for your attention.
See you soon.
(Applause)
Without identity, we cannot be in society.
The first thing people with disabilities lose when they are born is their identity.
They are labeled, renowned, for a diagnosis that doesn't talk about the person.
Disposing identity is the beginning of a series of humiliations according to culture, context, circumstances, repeated throughout the history of humanity.
And the school reproduces what the Spartans wonder when asked, in the presence of a student with disabilities, what does he have?
But to name is an act of resistance.
And so the body becomes a sign.
And our children and our young people can be recognized.
So the right question is who is it?
The school has the power to appoint.
School returns identity.
He has the power to restore person status.
As simple as that: School dignifies.
So, if we dream of an inclusive society, the key is in school.
(Applause) (Virers)
I have a daughter who is 13 years old, but in 2012, when it was the financial collapse, that all the bags in the world fell and all that, I had five fewer than now, I would be eight, nine years old.
And we were watching the news, we were having lunch and watching the news and a kind of peeled tie appeared, a journalist who always gave bad news, was the one who predicted the tsunami and that a plane fell, and that day he said, "Last minute, the bag collapsed all over the world."
And my daughter looked at me like that and I looked pale.
And the guy followed, he says, "The nominal value of the bond was skyrocketed because they couldn't sustain debt obligations."
And my daughter was looking at me.
"Investment banking collapsed," he said, "shareholders are committing suicide."
And my daughter opened her eyes big and so did I.
Obviously I was scared because something serious was going on.
And then Nina, my daughter, who always asked me what the tsunami is, what is the plane that fell and was easy to explain the tsunami: it is the epicenter of a thing at sea that Filipinos later die, is simple.
(Laughter) He asked me, "What is this happening now, Dad, is it serious?"
And I realized I had no idea how to explain to a kid what that was.
An earthquake is easily explained, but how do you explain to a baby the collapse of the financial system?
You can't explain it to him because it's intangible, more than anything.
But since I'm "hard head" and in free times I'm a writer too, I set out to do it, so I wrote a childish story.
And the next day, when we were watching the news back and asked again, I told you a story I want to share with you. I told Nina that day that there was once a very quiet village and that there was a boy named Pepe, the protagonist, who lived in the house farthest from the village.
One afternoon, Pepe went for a walk and grabbed him thirsty.
When he returned home, he opened a bottle of wine and, while drinking the wine, discovered something no one had ever discovered: there were no bars in the village.
There wasn't a bar.
Pepe thought if he opened a bar, he could make others happy, giving them a drink, and also thought he could earn some coin.
And he was happy with the idea of opening a bar.
That afternoon, his friend, Moncho, stopped by Pepe's house and gave him a good name for the bar.
And it's already known that when a night-time idea has a name, you're already starting to walk that idea.
Then Pepe made a list of needs to open the town's first bar.
Nina looked at me with my eyes open, the story was fine so far.
Pepe realized that you had to buy tables, chairs, drinks, paint, a palenque so that the bar's customers put their horses and could come in to take.
And he took out the bills and all that was going to cost him about 10,000 coins.
Of course, Pepe didn't have 10,000 coins because he was poor, but overnight he came up with a way to get those 10,000 coins.
Pepe cut 1,000 papers and wrote the phrase on each paper: "Next, Bar de Pepe"; 1000 times he wrote that.
And on Sunday, after Mass, he went to the village square dressed in his best suit and said to all the neighbors in the square: "Dear neighbors, I will open a bar on the outskirts of the village."
Everyone looked at him.
What a good idea.
Some said.
Pepe felt very good with everyone's attention and then he showed, in fan, the 1000 papers trimmed and said, "This is important, Nina" I said - Pepe said: "Every one of these 1000 papers costs 10 coins."
The neighbors were looking at him.
"Whoever buys me a little paper is going to have to keep it because in a month, when I open my bar, I'm going to pay 12 coins for every little paper you give me back."
Then there were whispers throughout the square and Moncho, who was the fool of the people, asked, "Pará, Pepe.
But doesn't it cost 10 coins each paper?
Why are you going to give away two more coins later?"
And Pepe said, "It's not giving away, Mocho, it's compensating.
I'm going to compensate with two more coins that help me fulfill my dream, which is to open a bar."
Then the mayor, who was out there, came up and said, "It makes sense.
It makes a lot of sense.
All right, Pepe.
And Ernesto, who was rich and understood business, said: "To me, the idea seems very good to me."
And the priest Ricardo, taking some coins from below from his cassock, said: "It's a very Christian idea.
I want some of your papers".
And they all started buying Pepe's papers.
That simple way, and in a single morning, Pepe got the money to open his bar.
Among all the neighbors they bought him the 1000 papers.
"I bought him two," Sabino said he was poor, but optimistic.
"I bought him 36," Quique shouted that he was greedy and haughty.
Pepe went home with 10,000 coins in his backpack and fell asleep thinking about his dream: open a bar.
The next day it was Monday and Pepe traveled to the city and bought wood to build a counter and bought paint, went home and got to work.
He didn't go through the village square in the next four weeks.
I mean, I told Nina, Pepe didn't know the disaster he was going to build because of his papers.
At that point in the story I braked and I looked at my daughter to see if I was understanding the story.
You always have to "test" the metaphors with the boys, especially when they're complex ideas, and she said, "Dad, this has nothing to do with what the peeled lord said about the peeling man from the tee, but it's good, I went on."
(Laughter) Then I told him.
I told him what happened in town for the first week.
That Monday, the square was full of people, much more than on a normal Monday.
Many neighbors had spent the whole night cutting their own papers because they too, they had discovered, they had projects they could not comply with due to lack of coins.
Some papers said, "Shortly, Hiderie of Horace."
Other papers said: "Very soon, Carmen's hairdresser."
And there were even some papers written by Moncho with spelling faults, which read: "At the end of the month, I went to the Moon."
(Laughter) Suddenly, the neighbors climbed the lanterns of the square so that the other neighbors could buy those papers.
They climbed to the fountain to exchange papers for coins.
Tuesday was even worse and on Wednesday you could no longer walk through the square of the "quilombo" that existed.
The mayor had to put order and set up a closed place in the municipality so that the neighbors could meet to exchange papers without destroying the square.
This small premises opened on Thursday and was named "the living room of the papers."
And so on Friday, everyone who had a project had already gotten the coins needed to carry it out and had started working.
Horacio was already looking for milk, cream, ice for his ice cream shop, Pepe was already shirking the wood for the bar counter.
Carmen sharpened the scissors for his brand new hairdresser and Moncho had bought two skinny horses to make trips to the Moon.
(Laughter) Only a group of neighbors who had never thought of any interesting projects were left in the room of the papers.
All these neighbors had were other people's papers.
One of these neighbors, Ramon, complained loudly: "Wow."
He said.
"Now I need coins to buy cigarettes and I don't have.
A few days ago, I traded my last 10 coins for a little Pepe paper and now I need to smoke."
"The same thing happens to me," Luis said, "I want to go to the movies, I don't have a coin."
Complaints were increasing until Sabino, who was astute, raised his paper and said: "Let's see, guys, in three weeks' time, Pepe is going to pay 12 coins to the one who returns this little paper that I bought to 10.
I'm seeing my little paper right now for eight coins.'
And the others looked at him, they said, "Oh. "
"I try done," Ernesto said he was rich, but he wanted to be even richer and took his hands out, for eight coins, the paper.
Ramón and Luis also sold their papers for less than 10 coins and, while one was running to buy cigarettes and the other went to the cinema, the other neighbors saw that this was a new way of doing business, even if never in life would have come up with a real idea.
Some went up to the chairs, others to the tables.
They began to offer what they had and even the priest Ricardo came from the sad church and said: "Friends, the day Moncho put his papers up for sale, I, who am a Christian, bought him a few because he is foolish.
Now Moncho sells them to seven coins and says he's going to return 20 coins, but he's dumb and wants to make trips to the moon.
I now need coins to fix the bell tower and nobody wants to buy Moncho's papers."
"Sorry, Father Richard," everyone said, "we can't buy.
How's that boy going to the moon?
Then the priest left the living room with Moncho's papers, cabizbajo, and it was the first time in many years that no one was helping him repair the church.
And so the first week passed.
Then I looked at Nina, who said, "Now it seems to me that it's starting to look like what the TV peel said."
And I say, "Of course.
In the real world the paper room is called 'the stock market', while the papers can have two names.
They can be called 'bonuses', in some countries, in other countries they are called 'obligations'.
The 12 coins Pepe will pay when the bar works, or the 20 coins Moncho says he will pay when he makes trips to the Moon, are called 'nominous bonus of the bond'."
And Nina looked at me like that.
(Laughter) He opened his big eyes because he understood the girl, eight years.
Then I told him what happened the second week in the village.
I told him Pepe's house no longer looked like a house, Pepe's house seemed like something else.
In the dining room there was a wooden bar, the bathroom had been converted into two bathrooms, one for ladies, one for gentlemen.
The walls were half painted in navy blue and Pepe was very happy with the progress of his bar.
As he had not yet gone to the village, Pepe, he still did not know that the lives of his neighbors were a "quilombo" of papers that were going and changing prices and owner.
Even the mayor, after talking to his secretary, decided to join the new fashion.
On Tuesday morning, the mayor went out on the balcony with a megaphone and said: "Vecinos, the square was damaged after the wasteland anger.
I need to raise funds to fix the shattering of the lanterns, to renovate the fountain and to buy me a motor car.
From this moment on, I put 1000 official papers on sale."
"How many coins do you cost?"
Sabino asked.
"No coins".
The mayor said, "my papers cost a horse.
When the fountain pours water, when the lanterns give birth again and I have a motor car, I'm going to return two horses for paper.
Official papers are on sale from now on, they run that they're over.'
The mayor's papers were sold in record time.
Everyone in the village handed over their horses to the mayor and, from that day, the tasks began to be done on foot.
Meanwhile, the paper exchange continued to increase and the pencils no longer reached to score who owned what.
Some papers were very desired, for example, those of Pepe who worked day and night in the realization of his bar, but to other papers were not wanted by anyone, for example, those of Moncho because his device to make trips to the Moon, for the moment, was only two horses and a car.
Nobody thought that started flying.
Ernesto, the wealthy neighbor who had bought many papers during the first week, now wanted to get Moncho's papers off her.
And, as he also had Pepe's papers, he invented something very good to what he called: " Ernesto's girdles."
They were closed packages with 100 papers of all colors.
For example, there were 10 papers from the Pepe bar above, 20 papers from the horacio ice cream parlor in the middle and 70 papers of Moncho's lunar project down, without anyone seeing them.
On Thursday of the second week, Ernesto's bundles had great success among the neighbors who were looking like crazy Pepe or the mayor's papers, but on Friday, Quique discovered the trick and said, "Beware, neighbors, beware.
Ernesto's bundles sometimes come with papers from Pepe or the mayor at the top and that's fine, but at the bottom of the package there are many Moncho papers that never in the fucking life will make any trip to the Moon.
So before I buy bundles of Ernesto, seek my advice.
My fee for every council is two coins."
(Laughter) Since then, paper buyers have always consulted Quique before buying Ernesto girdles.
Ernesto and Quique, who had been friends for many years, stopped talking to each other forever.
And so the second week passed.
By that point, Nina was almost an expert on this whole thing.
I explained to him that in the real world the mayor's official papers are called "public debt titles."
I explained that Ernesto's bundles are called "debt obligations," while Quique's house, the place where the neighbors go to know whether or not they trust Ernesto's bundles, is called "investment bank."
Then I told Nina that, when the third week began in the village, some projects were almost finished and, on the other hand, others were still in diapers.
Pepe only needed to nail the palenque so that the neighbors' horses graze outside the bar.
Horacio had managed to beat milk and fruit for his ice cream shop and just had him to bring ice bars from the city.
Instead, Carmen had not yet found a good place to install her hairdresser, although she already had dozens of sharp scissors.
So, what about Moncho?
Poor Moncho.
His horses were getting weaker and sad, although he brushed them day and night, and it didn't look like his artifact could fly in less than a week.
Neighbors who had papers from Moncho or Carmen were restless and could no longer sell them to anyone.
Until Quique showed up with a great idea.
"Hey".
Quique said.
"Those who still have Moncho's papers don't worry.
I can sell you "quique's lax" for those papers.
"What is that?
"Are you knowing, you had a lot of Moncho papers?"
"Very easy," Quique said.
"Whoever has Moncho's papers pays me two coins every night here at the end of the month and if Moncho doesn't get to make trips to the Moon, I pay the 20 coins promised by Moncho."
"Even if Moncho fails?"
They asked everyone.
"Even if it fails.
"" Quique said.
"Tremenda idea.
"We're going to feel a lot more calm and we can buy more papers from the village fool," Sabino said.
"That's why my idea is called Quique's 'quique's tarniture," Quique said.
And many neighbors started paying Quique two coins a night to secure Moncho's project.
In the midst of euphoria over these new ideas, no one in the village noticed that the mayor had never fixed the lanterns or the fountain of the square.
The mayor had fulfilled only part of the promise: he had escaped the town with a motor car.
That was all I'd done.
And the only horses left in the village were those of Moncho.
Everyone else had taken them to the mayor.
The secretary, who had been the mayor's right hand and knew the scam from the beginning, decided to do something so that no one would discover the absence of his boss.
And his idea was great: He brought a board to the little paper room and began to put a note, from one to ten, to each project.
Pepe's bar put an eight, Carmen's hairdresser's barge put a five, to the ice cream of Horacio, a seven.
The vehicle to make trips to the Moon of Moncho put a two and, becoming distracted, the reforms of the mayor's square put a nine with fifty.
"What do these numbers mean?
"What do you think?" asked Sabino.
And the secretary said: "These are the possibilities for the concreteness of each project.
It's to help, I'm doing it for you.' And so the third week passed.
At this point, I explained to Nina that in the real world, Quique's idea of offering peace of mind on Moncho's papers is called "debt default insurance" and the big slate where the secretary puts a note on each project, in the real world, is called "qualification agencies," which sometimes go wrong without wanting and sometimes they're wrong to want.
Then Nina asked me if Pepe had finally managed to open her bar because we were already in the fourth week and I told her the end of the story.
The end of the story reads: When the fourth week came and the month was completed, Pepe got up very early and walked quietly to the village.
By far, the facade of his bar was seen with the luminous poster to full cloth.
The bar was called "The Moon," as Moncho had been named on the first day.
Now only the neighbors were missing on horseback, with their thirsty throats dead.
Pepe toured the five leagues to the village putting up signs on all the trees on the road: "Bar La Luna, open every night."
Every sign he put in, he went away and was proud to look at the sign.
However, when he arrived in the village square, he understood nothing of what was going on.
He thought he had got the wrong way and was in a different town.
It seemed that the war had gone through that town.
The lanterns and the fountain of the square were shattered, there was not a single horse in the streets and the neighbors walked in the round talking alone.
"What happened here?"
Pepe asked Horacio when he saw him.
"Oh, I.
Pepe," Horacio said crying.
"Oh, Pepe.
Everyone went crazy with the papers, mine, with Carmen's, with yours, with everyone.
Suddenly, there began to be more papers than coins and the mayor escaped the town.
Then there were no coins anymore.
Later the horses disappeared.
Ernesto's bundle sellers broke.
Quique's reassured revellers couldn't pay anyone and escaped the night.
We're in ruin, Pepe."
"And your ice cream project?"
Pepe asked.
"And Carmen's hairdresser?"
"No, my thing was a failure," Horacio said.
'There's no horses to go get ice in the city and the ice cream melts.
And Carmen doesn't have clients.
Everyone's doing their hair by himself.
What do they want hairdresser for?"
Pepe stayed silent, couldn't believe what he was being told.
Then Horace said, "Oh, my God.
I need something strong".
And Luis said, "Me too, I have a dry throat."
And Sabino asked, "Pepe, did you open the bar you wanted to open?"
And others came to ask about the bar, too.
Pepe then discovered that, without a horse, no one would ever be able to go to his bar on the outskirts of the village and also understood that he could never return the 10,000 coins to anyone.
And then he saw Moncho in the middle of the square.
Moncho's two skinny horses were the only remaining animals and dragged three cars, with two wheels each, in the form of a train.
Many neighbors were climbing to those cars and others lined up, waiting to climb.
"Moncho".
Pepe asked, "Where are all these people going?"
And Moncho said, "Where is it going to be?
To your bar.
To the Moon".
Pepe saw a sign hanging on the broken fountain that read: "Moncho makes trips to La Luna.
Departures: a coin.
Back: free."
"But Moncho".
Pepe asked, "Did you know everyone was going to run out of horse?"
"No," Moncho said, "I only know one thing: I know what people can go to a bar on horseback, but nobody can go drunk and riding a horse."
"And since I don't drink, I thought my business might be to take them and bring them from The Moon."
Then Pepe hugged Moncho, got in the first car and shouted, "Come on to The Moon.
Free drinks on the first night," and the whole town went up and applauded.
Nina even applauded the end of the story.
And then I told my daughter to be careful because in the real world the stories of the Pepes that try to open bars, or the stories of the Monchos who want to make trips to the Moon and no one understands them, are almost always projects that usually have no happy ending like in children's stories.
Because in the middle Quiques appear, mayors appear, Ernestos and secretaries appear and always spoil everything.
But when one of these projects does work, I told my daughter to finish, when these projects work, when something magical happens and works, they are called "dreams" and are usually wonderful.
(Applause) Thank you very much.
(Applause)
They probably remember this image of Chancellor Angela Merkel taking a selfie with a refugee.
This image and others raised blisters in the German parliament and in many European parliaments, putting the European Union in check.
From the beginning there was no consensus among the German population in the face of such an avalanche of refugees from the Middle East, on the way to Europe.
Angela Merkel's welcoming culture from the beginning was not always valued by everyone.
From the beginning there were people who supported her and other people who didn't.
People who don't support it today, there are more and more, there are more and more detractors, and this is going to take its toll on Angela Merkel, obviously.
I don't want to go into detail about Angela Merkel's political future, but I would like to mention that she, for me, is one of the political people currently who has moral authority despite her mistakes, which most current politicians lack.
This is a graph showing the number of refugees who entered Germany over the past year.
The first group is from Syria, followed by the group that came from Iraq, and the group that came from Afghanistan.
According to a UNICEF report published just two weeks ago, half of people fleeing war are minors.
The anti-refugee speech is well known: "They're going to Islamize us."
"We're letting terrorists in".
"We're losing my identity".
And it is true that there are also people who are very pro-in favour or empathize with people fleeing war, but I can also see that among these people there is a kind of shielding themselves from the mistakes of politicians not to act, so as not to participate in initiatives that can, if not resolved, at least alleviate these very serious personal dramas.
The informal speech and the official speech highlights German learning as key to the integration of refugees.
I'm from Barcelona, I'm a linguist.
For four years I have lived in Cologne, Germany, and for me it is also a key factor in learning the language in order to integrate, but not only for refugees it is a key factor, but for all immigrants in general.
I have been investigating different aspects of the language in multilingual environments for several years, and for me the language is not a final product that can be mastered.
For me language is a process that is changing throughout life, throughout the personal experiences we are having.
Obviously, language is a powerful instrument of integration, of inclusion, but also a powerful instrument of social exclusion.
If, for example, you have poor linguistic competence or have a foreign accent, or a particular dialect of a region, or, perhaps, you have some kind of disability that affects the production of the oral language, such as stuttering, all these are examples that influence how people are going to accept you or are going to marginalize you in a society.
The use of language and identity is not a static thing, it is something that is changing.
It's not like fingerprints, which is what accompanies you all your life.
Identity is something that is created or forged according to the values and beliefs your family gives you, your friends give you and it also depends on what you really want to be, and what you really want to be is based on your motivation, the feeling of belonging that you have with other groups with which you feel related or identified and also depending on the interactions with groups that are totally different from you.
Refugee centres in Germany offer free German classes, and one might think, it is natural to think, that these people should be happy to be able to receive these German courses and also that they should be grateful.
But the absence of teenage girls in these German groups, in these activities, is really significant.
Get in a position: these girls carry a lot of burden, many post-traumatic disorders, due to an exodus, to a land that no one had promised them, have seen their loved ones murder, seen how they burned or bombed their homes, others have unfortunately also witnessed or victims of rape in their particular transfer from Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria on their way to Europe, or on this case from Germany.
If you get in your skin, would you feel like doing German classes or anything else?
For more inri, the families of these girls, parents, siblings or other relatives prevent them from participating in these activities because they think that they will, perhaps, hurt them even more.
And the question is: What to do to get these girls to start participating in this new society and be able to integrate?
This is the question we asked ourselves four friends: with the red sweater, Sandra, then I'm, Lina and Peter.
The four, for different reasons, have a lot to do with adolescence.
Peter and I, for having quinceañeras.
And Sandra and Lina, for working with this group, adolescence, too.
We think: what if we do a project where it is not only attractive to refugee girls, but also attractive to German girls?
Could we get them together?
Could we create a space for them to interact and perhaps that could help transform their identity?
That's how HalloPhoto's inicative was born.
It's an intercultural project for teenage girls between the ages of 13 and 17.
The objectives of this project were: to develop... well, first to create these spaces of interaction in order to develop the communicative competences.
And the girls' creative skills.
We thought: if we develop both things I will surely create the possibility for them to develop intercultural competences as well.
Obviously, in order to develop the communicative competences it had to go through the learning of German, there was no other, and we used a novel method: the augmentative communication boards.
Increaser communication boards are help for people who are not verbal, i.e. people who do not have oral language.
This condition can be given from birth, for example in the case of children with severe autism spectrum disorders, or for example in children with cerebral palsy.
This condition can also occur when you are already an adult, because you have a stroke or because you have an accident, or because you suffer from a neurodegenerative disease, such as parkinson.
These boards we use for the project are composed of pictograms and the core vocabulary.
The core vocabulary are the words that are repeated most in the spontaneous language and this happens, not only in German, but also in Spanish, in Catalan, Basque, in English, etc.
The truth is that the girls accepted these instruments very well, and the data collected in the project show that they do, that they value it positively.
Anyway, for them this is not the determining factor in learning German, to have dreams, to be motivated, to really want to participate in this new society.
For them, the really significant thing is the meetings we form, which we organize in HalloPhoto, in our project.
They are intercultural encounters because we were promoting face-to-face interaction of groups with totally different reference frameworks.
This, for example, is the image of one of the encounters.
We organized these intercultural meetings on issues and the topics were decided by them.
This is the theme "Making and hairdressing."
In another of the encounters we went to an adventure center where there were zip lines, there were sets of balances, tunnels.
The issue was not to create fear, but to overcome fear.
Together they were helping each other, and it was not a matter of who was most afraid or less afraid, which group was the one who was most afraid or less, was simply each in his expression.
You see it in the faces, you can't define who is who, the one who's afraid.
The thing is, in this one, along with other meetings... This is the encounter we made about cooking.They see meaning.
And it is in that construction of meaning that generates a sense of mestizaje, a sense of creating links, intercultural developments that go beyond labels.
The labels all they do is generate stereotypes and generate prejudices that don't account for the wealth so great that we are each of us, or that we have each of us.
In addition to the communicative competences we also wanted to develop creative skills.
Creativity is the affective and cognitive expression of each individual.
And if we activate that expression together, first, a space is developed to generate things, first unthinkable, that are mestizojes of expressions where you can already begin to see how intercultural competition is being forged.
That's why these photography workshops were held, to generate this creativity.
The photography workshops were made by Peter and Sandra, who are the photographers of the group.
And these are the pictures the girls took throughout the project.
Sometimes they posed and sometimes they were photographers, they decided.
And when you see these pictures, you think, where's the "shes"?
Where's the "we"?
Borders are as very diluted.
How do we define each other?
The photos seemed so beautiful we thought we should do an exhibition.
But we didn't want to do an exhibition of use, we didn't want to do an exhibition in a museum or in an art gallery.
We wanted to move our photos, our exhibition, to an urban space and we had a vision.
This is the computer recreation of our vision: we wanted our girls to be on a tram, the tram of desire.
Our desire was to have a platform, a platform that was a political statement against sexism and against xenophobia.
We presented it to the public transport of Cologne and were quite excited about the project.
And in early July, last July, the tram was presented with the girls' photos.
(Applause) The project was much more successful than we imagined.
In fact, the press highlighted us as an exemplary project, to counter xenophobic tendencies that sadly are increasingly, not only in Germany, but throughout Europe.
Likewise, there were many people who asked us if they could replicate the project, if they could do their special HalloPhoto.
And for this reason we think: we're going to license it, so everyone can use it.
That's why the project is in Creative Commons, and from this scenario, from TEDxValladolid, I invite you to all who want to participate and start your own project, to do so.
(Applause) And it's not what we've taught, the four people on the team, but what the girls have taught us.
All the participants in the group have shown us ways of communicating and ways of interacting.
First, they break stereotypes.
Second, they create bridges.
That have also generated transformed, powerful and intercultural identities, and these intercultural identities are not based on consensus, but on mutual respect, on that mutual respect, on that mutual respect to empathize with the other, of putting themselves in the skin of the other, in order to have that feeling of belonging.
And that feeling of belonging is the one I've been feeling before you while I was telling you all this, and for this I'm very grateful to you.
(Applause)
What comes to mind when you hear the words post-traumatic stress disorder?
Maybe words like war, violence or army.
Post-traumatic stress disorder is a mental disorder that can develop after experiencing or witnessing life-threatening events such as war, accidents, assaults or natural disasters.
Symptoms may include: nightmares, reliving, difficulty concentrating, difficulty sleeping, avoiding things and places, and negative thoughts What comes to mind when I ask you, what is mental health?
Maybe you're thinking, "Depressed... me?
I don't have that.
Hospital, or how does our mind work?
During the summer of 2016, I traveled alone to Amsterdam, before studying in Salamanca, Spain.
I visited Anne Frank's house.
As he walked down the hallways and floors, he looked at the images and stories.
At one point I just stayed there and cried.
I was touched by what I saw and read.
No one thought this was weird, nor did he talk to me when he saw me cry.
In this space, I felt like I could do it, and I stayed there as long as I could.
No one knew that my reason for getting into this place was to find a place to cry, where no one would ask me why.
No one knew, at the time, that I was crying because I had been sexually assaulted.
This feeling of fear, shame, led me to remain silent, to find comfort in a place where crying seemed to be okay.
I went home wanting to erase this memory forever, but everything changed quickly.
I started experiencing panic attacks, often originated images and news, reminding me of the assault.
I felt guilty and ashamed, I felt empty and lonely.
And although I saw myself as someone who had everything under control, deep inside, I was crumbling.
Don't tell it, they're gonna think you're crazy.
Why did you walk alone?
Why did you travel alone?
But why did you put yourself in this situation?
How are you today?
This.
This helped me decide to get help.
When I started having suicidal thoughts, my best friend told me, that there was help available, and she connected me to the health and psychological services at university.
When I had panic attacks, I had friends who were just a message or call away.
They didn't have to say anything, they just listened.
The support, the acceptance, and having someone nearby, allowed me to seek that help.
Eventually, I got the help I needed and was able to recover from post-traumatic stress disorder.
According to the World Health Organization, about 800,000 people die by suicide each year.
In 2016 there were 3569 suicides in Spain, according to the National Institute of Statistics.
Almost ten people a day, one every two and a half hours.
Suicide can be prevented and although we are not all experts, psychologists or psychiatrists, we all have the power to make a difference in someone's life, and we play a critical role in creating change.
It can be as simple as listening.
Yes, it's important to risk talking loudly for those who have lived or are living the trauma.
But if my friend hadn't risked asking me how she was, maybe I, I would never have spoken.
I challenge you to break the barrier between those who are struggling and those who are not, because no one has to feel ashamed that they are not well.
Each of us has to take a chance and reach out, and ask, how are you today?
Thank you.
(Applause)
It's nice to be here.
(Applause) (Fin of applause) I've always wondered where the rhythm is.
Will it be in your ear?
Will he be the listen?
Or is he in what I see?
And then, on the phone with me, I realize... How's that?
That I see in.
Around me there's so many rhythms.
And if I were deaf, couldn't I move?
Of course I do, Maria.
Because the pace is out there in what you see.
And it's inside your body.
I'm missing something.
Yes, the pants.
I've been given so many wires to talk to you.
(Laughter) But they forgot that I have pants.
(Applause) Yes, I got them.
I want to tell you there's nothing like a smile.
When someone comes up and says, "I want to dance."
Oh, sure.
You can dance.
With what?
What you got.
Oh, oh.
I see a mirror in my hand.
Oh, ah.
The mirror says yes... you can.
And what is the weather?
Time is in the do and giving.
It's no use what I have inside, if I don't have a chance to give the other.
So that in turn I find paths and movement.
Maria, and the rhythm?
It's in yours.
When you breathe; (Exhalation) you already have rhythm inside.
When you see, the pace is out.
I'm full of colorful little lights that talk to me, they're stars.
Stars that light up, light up this afternoon.
No, Maria, it's the day.
No, it seems night.
Because the stars light up when it's night.
And what's the day?
Having stars in their hands that look at us and talk to us.
Can you give this?
Of course I do.
Because it's inside of you.
It's within every look.
In every move we make is the rhythm you have created.
The rhythm is out of your body, but how beautiful what I have on the floor.
It's a circle.
That's wonderful.
He has no doors.
The circle has no doors.
I don't know where to go.
But how am I up here?
They brought me.
They brought me here to come near you.
And tell them you can.
Don't be afraid.
If I can't do this, I can do another.
If I can't do another one, I can do the other.
I'm the other one.
I'm here to give you what you don't say you have.
What do you have?
The life.
What is life?
That's what I don't know.
That's what I want to find.
That's what I want to look for.
And only the movement is going to help me.
That's why I ask you, if the word is movement and in my body there is the rhythm I don't hear, you know?
I'm deaf.
I don't know what the sound of the word is.
But I know, deaf as I am, I can feel the infinite rhythm that moves my body.
And I like dancing, you know?
I've always wanted to dance.
Because I always see the movement.
The movement, do you know when it starts?
When I open my eyes in the morning and say, "How beautiful the day you are waiting for me."
Today is my day.
Thank you.
(Applause)
She just got a letter.
He assumes that they ask him to pay or to leave and think about the boys, think about his work, think of the couple who abandoned her; he opens it and reads it.
He doesn't understand, he can't understand.
They're asking him to leave now, to leave now, the boys are gone, things are scattered.
I would have nowhere to go to sleep today.
If you had a translator on your phone, without losing any information, you could read this.
[Pay in 48 hours, if you will not be sued.]
And she'd stay calm, and maybe she'd go to the Access to Justice Center where they'd tell her she has time and they're going to help her.
But there is no translator of language to a language that we all understand.
Google says it's too expensive for the few we're the community we're right to.
The letter is not understood but sends two messages.
The first is "punch a lawyer."
The conflict escalated and now we can't resolve it by chatting.
The second is darker.
The second one says, "You.
It's out of the language of the law."
The language belongs to lawyers and lawyers, judges and judges, but not to you.
As she's going to have to fix herself in some way, we all know that many times in Argentina, "some way" is outside the law.
So that doesn't happen, I am part of the Argentine Clear Language Network, where we try to bring the language of the law closer to the language of every day.
After all, the law in democracy is ours.
(Applause)
Today, in this place, we are approximately 5,000 women.
1250 of us suffered or will suffer at some point in his life from a sexual assault.
1 in 4.
Only 10 per cent will make the complaint.
The remaining 90 per cent take refuge in silence.
One half, because the fact happens within the very within the family or with someone known and that makes it much harder to live and tell.
The other half doesn't speak because they're afraid they won't believe them.
And they're right, because we don't believe them.
Today I want to tell you why I think I don't believe them.
We don't believe them because when a woman tells what happened to her, she says things we don't imagine, that disturb us, that we don't expect to hear, that amaze us.
We hope to hear stories like this.
"Young raped on the Mitre Railroad tracks.
It happened at midnight when he was returning home.
The young woman said a guy assaulted her in the back, told her not to scream, she had a gun, to stand still.
He raped her and then ran away."
When we hear or read such a news, we are immediately represented an image: the rapist, a depraved lower class; the victim, a young, attractive woman.
The image doesn't last more than 10 or 20 seconds and it's dark, it's flat; there's no moves, no sounds, it's like there aren't people.
But when a woman tells what happened to her, her story doesn't fit in 10 or 20 seconds.
Next is the testimony of a woman we're going to call Ana.
One of the 85 women I interviewed in the course of an investigation I did about rape.
Says Ana: "We had gone with the girls in the office to the same pub we always go.
We met some babies and I hooked up with a skinny piola.
We talk a lot.
At about 4:00, I told my friends to leave; they wanted to stay.
Then the skinny asked me where I lived and told me that if I looked good, he would approach me.
I accepted and we left.
At a traffic light he told me he liked me and touched my leg.
I don't like a guy moving forward like that, but he'd been loving all night.
I thought, "I can't be so paranoid, I say something out there and the guy nothing to see and offend him."
When he had to bend, he kept going.
I thought he was wrong and I said, 'You went too far.
'But I felt ugly.
Now I think, why don't I pay attention to what I felt?
When the car stopped near the highway, I was scared there.
But he told me to stay calm, that he liked me, that nothing would happen if I didn't want to; he spoke well to me.
I didn't tell him anything because I was afraid he would get angry and everything would be worse.
I thought I could have a gun in the glove compartment.
Suddenly he threw himself at me and wanted to kiss me.
I said, 'No.
'I wanted to push him, but he had my arms.
When I let go I tried to open the door, but it was locked.
Anyway, if I got out of the car, where was he going?
I told him he wasn't the kind of guy who needs to do that to be with a mine; that he liked him, too, but not that way.
I was trying to calm him down, I said nice things about him.
I was talking to him like I was his older sister.
Suddenly, he covered my mouth with one hand and with the other his belt was unbuttoned.
At that moment I thought he could kill me, hang, you know?
I never felt so lonely, as kidnapped.
I asked him to finish fast and take me home.'
What happened to you listening to this story?
Surely, several questions appeared to them.
For example, why didn't he lower the window and asked for help?
Why didn't he get out of the car when he felt something ugly could happen?
How could you ask him to take her to the house?
Now, when we're not in front of news in the media, in front of a story that someone like me tells them from a scenario like this; when we're in front of someone we know and who chose us to trust us with his story, what happened to him, we're going to have to listen to it.
And we're going to hear things that we won't be able to understand, or accept.
Then doubts will appear to us, questions, suspicions, and that will make us feel very bad; guilty.
So to defend ourselves against that discomfort, we have a resource.
We upped the volume to all those things in history that we expected to hear: the revolver in the glove compartment, the doors locked, the isolation of the place.
And we lowered the volume to all those things we didn't expect to hear and that we don't want to hear: like when she tells her that he also liked her, or when she tells us she was talking to her as if she were the older sister, or that she asked her to take her home.
What's the use of doing this?
To believe him, so I can trust that she was really a victim.
I call this victimization of the victims.
Victimization because in order to believe that she is innocent and that she is a victim, we need to think of them unarmed, paralyzed, silent.
But there is another way to get rid of discomfort, and that is exactly the reverse: we uploaded the volume to the things we didn't expect to hear, like, "I spoke to him well," "I asked him to take me home," "I asked him to finish fast," and we lowered it to things we did expect to hear, the revolver in the glother, isolation.
What's the point?
It serves so that we can grasp ourselves, and feel more comfortable with doubts.
Then new questions appear, for example: Who sends her to go to those bowlers?
Did you see how she and the friends, the minis, the necklines?
What are you waiting for?
Questions that, are certainly not questions, are rather trials and trials that end in a sentence: She looked for it.
The sentence would be corroborated by the fact that she later does not count her having fought to prevent rape.
Then it means he didn't resist, he means he consented.
If he looked for it and consented, what rape are you talking about?
I call this blame for the victims.
Both the arguments that serve us to blame as to victimize, we all have them, all in our heads, very handy, including victims and victims.
So much so that when Ana came to me, she told me that she didn't know if her testimony was going to serve me, because I wasn't sure what had happened to her was rape.
Ana, like most of us, also believed that a rape looks more like an armed robbery, a violent procedure that lasts 4 or 5 minutes, and not the chamuyo of a nice young man who lasts an entire night and ends in a kidnapping.
When she was afraid of being killed, she was afraid of being left with marks, and had to hand over her body to avoid it, there she knew the rape was something else.
Anna had never talked to anyone about this.
He could have turned to the family, but he didn't.
He didn't because he was afraid.
She was afraid that the person she had chosen to tell her would happen to her the same thing that happens to us all, and that it is that doubts and suspicions arise, those questions, every time a topic like this is talked about.
And if that had happened, it would have been maybe worse than the rape itself.
She could have spoken to a friend, a sister, very difficult with the couple: the slightest glimpse of doubt on her face or in her voice would have been devastating for her, and probably the end of the relationship.
Ana remains silent because intimately she knows that no one, not all of us, her family, not therapists, much less the police or magistrates, are willing to listen to what Ana did at that time.
First and foremost, Ana said "no."
When he saw that his was not useless, he spoke well, he tried not to exacerbate his violence, not to give him ideas.
He spoke to her as if everything that was going on at the time was normal, so as not to awaken in him the fear that she could later denounce him.
Now, I ask and ask you, "Isn't all that she did is resist?"
No, it's not for everyone or almost all of us, probably, because it's not for the law.
In most countries, the codes continue to ask that the victim, to prove her innocence, I say well, the victim to prove her innocence, to present marks on the body that she attests that she had a "tenacious and constant" struggle with her aggressor.
I can assure you that in most court cases, there are no marks that reach.
I heard a lot of women.
And I didn't hear any talk of herself as having been reduced to one thing, totally subject to the will of the other.
Rather, I heard them as amazed and even a little proud to acknowledge how lucid they had been at the time, you're attentive to every detail, as if that allowed them to have some control over what was going on.
Then I thought, "Of course, what women do in these situations is negotiate."
They negotiate sex for life.
They ask the aggressor to finish quickly, so that everything will end as soon as possible and at the lowest cost.
They undergo penetration, because even if they can't believe it, penetration is what keeps them from a sexual or affective scene the most.
They submit to penetration, because penetration hurts less than kisses, caresses, soft words.
Now, if we're going to keep waiting for rape to be what's very rarely to be: a rapist who is a depraved low-class, and not a young university student or an entrepreneur who leaves up on a Friday or Saturday; if we're going to keep waiting for the victims to be fashionable, recatamed women on the scene, and not women sure of themselves, we're going to still be unable to listen.
Women will still be unable to speak, and we will continue to be responsible for that silence and its loneliness.
(Applause)
You can imagine: you're in a bar and, you know, or in a nightclub, all that, and you start talking to a girl, and then, then, she goes out in the conversation "what are you doing?"
And since you think your job is interesting, you say, "I'm a mathematician".
(Laughter) 33.51 per cent of girls (Laughter) at the time simulate an urgent phone call and leave.
(Laughter) 64.69 per cent of girls desperately try to change the subject and leave.
(Laughter) There's 0.8% that are your cousin, your girlfriend and your mother, (Laughter) that they know you work on something weird but didn't remember what (Laughter) and there's 1 percent that follows the conversation.
When that conversation goes on, invariably one of these two phrases appears at some point: A) "I was fatal to mathematics, but it wasn't my fault, it's that the teacher was horrific."
(Laughter) And B) "But what the math thing is for?"
(Laughter) I'll take care of case B.
(Laughter) When someone asks you what mathematics is for, they're not asking you about mathematical science applications.
He's asking you, "And why did I have to study that shit I never used again?"
(Laughter) That's what you're really asking.
Faced with this, when a mathematician is asked what mathematics is for, we mathematicians divide into groups.
54.51 percent of mathematicians take a stand on the attack, and 44.77 % of mathematicians take a defensive stance.
There's 0.8%, weird, among those I include.
What are those about the attack?
Those of the attack are mathematicians who tell you that question does not make sense, because mathematics has a sense of their own in themselves, they are a beautiful building that has its own logic that is built and that you do not need to always be looking at possible applications.
What's the point of poetry?
What's the point of love?
What's the point of life itself?
What question is that?
(Laughter) Hardy, for example, is an exponent of this attack.
And those who are on the defensive tell you that even if you don't realize it, honey, the math is behind it all.
(Laughter) These always name bridges and computers.
If you don't know math, you drop the bridge.
(Laughter) Computers are really all mathematical.
Now these have also been given to tell you that behind computer security and credit cards are the prime numbers.
These are the answers your math teacher will give you if you ask him.
He's defensive.
Okay, but who's right?
Those who say mathematics don't have to be good for anything, or those who say it's really behind everything?
They're really right both of them.
But I told you I was of that 0.8 % weird thing that says otherwise, right?
So, okay, ask me what math is for.
(The public asks) Okay.
76.34 % of people have asked, there are 23.41 percent who have shut up, and 0.8% that I don't know what those are doing.
Well, dear 76.31%, mathematics is true that they don't have to serve at all, it's true that they're a beautiful building, a logical building, probably one of the greatest collective efforts that human beings have made throughout history.
But it is also true that wherever scientists, where technicians, they are looking for mathematical theories, models that allow them to move forward, there they are, in the math building, that permeate everything.
It's true that we have to go further to the bottom, let's see what's behind science.
Science works by intuition, by creativity, and mathematics tames intuition and tame creativity.
Almost everyone who hasn't heard it before is surprised that if you took a 0.1 mm thick sheet of paper, those we normally use, big enough, and could bend it 50 times, the thickness of that pile would occupy the distance from Earth to the Sun.
Your intuition tells you, "That's impossible".
You'll show it and you'll see that.
That's what mathematics is for.
It is true that science, all science, only makes sense because it makes us better understand the world this beautiful one we are in.
And because it makes us, it helps us to bypass the traps of the world this painful one we are in.
There are science that touches that app with your hand.
Oncological science, for example.
And there are others that we look at it from afar, with envy at times, but knowing that we are their support.
All basic sciences are the support of those, and among them mathematics.
Everything that makes science science is the rigor of mathematics.
And that rigour comes to them because their results are eternal.
They've probably said, or have you ever told, that a diamond is forever, right?
It depends what you understand forever.
A theorem, that's forever.
(Laughter) Theorem of Pythagoras, that is true even if Pythagoreans are dead, I tell you.
(Laughter) Even though the world sinks the theorem of Pythagorees it would still be true.
Where a couple of cateches and a good hypotenuse (Laughter) the Pythagorean theorem works to the fullest, to the fullest.
(Applause) Well, mathematicians are dedicated to making theorems.
Eternal truths.
But it is not always so easy to know what an eternal truth is, a theorem, and what is a mere conjecture.
It takes a demonstration.
For example: imagine I have a big, huge, infinite field here.
I want to cover it with equal pieces, leaving no gaps.
I could use squares, couldn't I?
I could use triangles.
Not Circles, they leave hollows.
What's the best piece I can use?
The one to cover the same surface has a smaller edge.
Pappus of Alexandria, in 300 said it was best to use hexagons, as bees do.
But he didn't prove it.
The guy said, "Hexage us, uh, peta, come on, hexagon, give it to me".
He didn't prove it, he stayed in a guess, he said, "Give us back".
The world, as you know, was divided between pappists and anti-pappists, until 1700 years later, 1700 years later, in 1999 Thomas Hales showed that Pappus and the bees were right, that it is best to use hexagons.
And that became a theorem, the honeycomb theorem, which is going to be true forever, ever, more than any diamond you have.
(Laughter) But what if we go to 3 dimensions?
If I want to fill the space, with equal pieces, without leaving holes, I can use buckets, right?
No, they leave hollows.
(Laughter) What is the best piece I can use?
Lord Kelvin, the one with the Kelvin grades and all that, that said it was best to use a truncated octahedron (Laughter) that as you all know (Laughter) This is here.
(Applause) Come on.
Who doesn't have a truncated octahedron at home?
(Laughter) Even if it's plastic.
Baby, bring the truncated octahedron, which are coming tours.
Everybody's got it.
(Laughter) But Kelvin didn't prove it.
He stayed in a guess, Kelvin's guess.
The world as you know, was divided between kelvinists and anti-kelvinists (Laughter) until a hundred and a hundred and years later, a hundred and peak years later, someone found a better structure.
Weaire and Phelan, Weaire and Phelan found this little thing from here, (Laughter) this structure to which they put the imaginative name of structure of Weaire and Phelan.
(Laughter) It seems like a weird thing but it's not that weird, it's also present in nature.
It is very curious that this structure, due to its geometric properties, was used to build the swimming building at the Beijing Olympic Games.
There Michael Phelps won eight gold medals, became the best swimmer of all time.
Well, of all time until another better one gets out, right?
As happened to the structure of Weaire and Phelan, it's the best until another better one comes out.
But be careful, because this one does have the opportunity, that even if they pass a hundred and hundred and hundred years, even in 1700 years, someone shows that this is the best possible piece.
And then it will be a theorem, a truth forever, always never.
More than any diamond.
So, well, if you want to tell someone you love him forever (Laughter) you can give him a diamond, but if you want to tell him you will love him forever, always, give him a theorem.
(Laughter) Yes, still, you will have to prove it, that your love does not remain in conjecture.
(Applause) Thank you.
We are each in a way in this life.
Some of us are more extroverted, others more introverted and others, not one thing or the other.
I, I have to say, I'm very introverted.
I'm not good at social relations.
Imagine how hard it is for me to put myself in this red spot in front of so many people.
It's much more interesting for me to be on a Saturday in a quiet place with a friend or two, to get in the hustle and bustle of a crowded nightclub.
And I'm not telling you anymore, to stay home, quietly, in the heat, watching a movie.
Oh, the movies.
There's nothing in this world I like more.
Cinema has been my biggest passion in the last five or six years.
In this time, I have developed a taste for cinema that goes beyond the meaning of the word "entertainment."
And why the movies?
What does the movies have so I like it so much?
If I tell you the truth, until recently I hadn't asked myself that question.
I've already said I'm not good at interacting with people, but I'm very good at watching.
I love watching.
I enjoy watching people talk, interact with each other, walking, without being a gossip.
Don't think badly.
But that's why I think I like film so much.
In the movies, in the movies, you don't come in, just worthy to watch them from the outside.
Cinema gives you a broad, total view of the world, of all its people, of all its ideas, of all its forms of seeing reality.
And I think that's why I like cinema so much.
In all this time, I've seen thousands of those visions and I think I have a much more global idea of the world than if I'd ever watched, or watched movies.
I think that's the great advantage of being behind, not interacting.
And what kind of movies do I like?
I admit, not that it's the most typical cinema of people my age.
It is an author's cinema, independent, low-budget cinema, of social denunciation, far from the archetypes of cinema in the US, cinema of countries as rare cinematic as Turkey, Palestine or the Philippines.
Well, my mom says I'm very weird, but it's the kind of movies I like the most, the one I enjoy most, with her characters and stories.
They get to your heart.
You feel things with them, you suffer with them, you cry with them, you laugh with them.
As one of my favorite directors, Lars von Trier says: "Movies are like stones in the shoes, they have to hurt."
It's not that we have to suffer with each and every movie, but we have to feel real emotions.
However, when I watch US films, full of special effects, of empty characters, of stories that contribute nothing, it's just a story, nothing else.
It doesn't come to you, you don't feel, you don't suffer, you don't cry.
That, to me, is of no use.
I, being an introvert, took my hobby to the movies like something of mine, something personal.
Everyone knew it was very film but I had virtually no one to comment on the films I saw.
All this changed a day when, ironically, I go out of the cinema and receive a private message from Twitter: "Hello, we're looking for a boy or girl in Valladolid to cover this edition of the Seminci.
Would you sign up?"
And what would I say 7 days from the best author cinema in Europe and above all for free?
Well, "Of course.
Count on me".
And here I had, 15, a journalist's accreditation hanging around the neck.
That week I was watching movies, movies and movies.
I got a little into the journalistic world, but what I got out of there was a lot more than that.
I finally found a way to channel my feelings into the cinema, to express myself, to open my inner world to others.
Every day I had to write a chronicle with the films I saw, what I had liked about them, which I had upset.
And I don't know if it can seem easy or difficult, but it's very complicated, because a film has many elements: the script, the direction, the actors, the music, the sound.
So, what's okay with each of them?
Do they make the movie good or bad?
At first, this was very complicated.
I always forgot things about the chronicle.
But in the end, with the practice, it almost came out fluid.
When the 58th edition of the Seminci ended, I started collaborating on a regular basis with the web that I had accredited, which is called Esencia Cine.
In this time, almost a year, my ability to write, to express myself, and my enormous fondness for cinema have been increasing and increasing by leaps and bounds.
That was last year.
What happened this year?
I hung up on the accreditation and got back to work on the 59th edition of the Seminci.
I assure you that this year I learned a lot more because I saw more films, practically 20 in 7 days, I went to a lot more press conferences and had a meeting with Imanol Arias.
The result was a week of cinema, cinema and more cinema, in which I learned a lot.
And I assure you that will always remain, even if I did not study, even if I did not eat practically even if I did not sleep, I learned and it will stay for me forever.
Many people, when I tell them I write for a website, which I write for the Seminci, almost everyone says to me, "Do you pay you?"
Well...
Well, no.
Why would they pay me?
Why are they going to pay me when I do what I really like, what I really feel and on top serves to open up to others?
At this age I'm, I wouldn't find anyone to pay me to do this.
I don't have the race, I don't have anything.
But, really, in this life, if you want to do something, do it.
If you get paid, great.
If not, you'll be happy with your work, which I think is the most important thing.
- No?
(Applause) Cinema has opened many more doors for me than I thought.
Because I write about movies, I get to open up, I get really myself.
When I write, I break the barrier I have of oral expression, which costs me so much.
I can really be me, to translate my ideas as I feel.
But far from all this, which serves me a lot and what I am proud of, I think what I like most, with what I enjoy most with my work, is when I write something, a news, criticism or reportage, I hang it and receive messages from colleagues, friends, family, teachers who say: "Congratulations.
You write great.
I love it".
You know that when you do that, your job, apart from coming good to you, it suits others because they enjoy and learn what you do.
And when they tell you that, you know it's great.
(Applause) And here you see me, a quiet, shy, introverted boy, who at 15 years old and without any faith in himself, managed to do the same job as journalists with his work, his degree, his salary and his best public expression skills.
The way I found to open up wouldn't change it for anything.
I'm me when I write, it's me.
And I'm going to tell you something, don't think about what you see from me every day, what you see in photos and videos.
Don't you think.
Hold on what I write, because that's me, really me.
No lid, no barrier.
But far from all this, that "Congratulations.
You write great.
I love what you do," is the best thing they can tell me.
It's the prettiest thing they can tell me in life, being an introvert.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
