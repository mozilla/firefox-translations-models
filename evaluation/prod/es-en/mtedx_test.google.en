You. Have you ever imagined how to call or name someone who does not have a first or last name?
Hey!
You!
That word that identifies us Argentines so much, &quot;che&quot;.
But I am thinking of another someone who does not have a first or last name.
I am thinking of that someone who lost their first and last name, who lost their first and last name, their identity.
Now in Argentina people are disappearing.
In the world, right now, thousands of people disappear.
Some are disappeared who are alive, the product of child trafficking, baby theft, human trafficking, illegal adoptions.
Others are disappeared who have died: kidnappings, wars, drug violence, terrorist attacks, natural accidents and others not so natural.
It is necessary to give them back their identity, rewrite their first and last name.
Because we all have an identity, we have an individuality, an individual, affective, family, cultural, group, country identity, but we also have a genetic identity.
Our identity is written in our genes.
Our genome, the human genome, is made up of four letters that are repeated 3 billion times.
Incredible!
But we are almost the same.
Almost the same!
To be exact, our genome is 99.9% identical between us.
Only 0.1% of our genome allows us to be distinguished or identified.
Now, 0.1% of 3 billion letters is nothing less than three million letters and that is a number.
Some books can be written with three million letters.
And that is what it is about, using the letters of our genome, rewriting the letters of the first and last name of those who lost their identity.
How do we do it?
Using genetics, comparing.
To identify is necessarily to compare.
To compare a father and a son, to find out if they are related in that relationship, I have to compare them.
And know that there is a proportion of those letters that they have in common according to that relationship.
In the 1980s, I had been working at the Hospital de Clínicas, in the genetics of transplants, seeking the maximum genetic compatibility between organ donors and recipients to avoid graft rejection.
And you will wonder, what does that have to do with identity?
It has to do a lot.
And how much!
Because our organism, our immune system, is profoundly xenophobic.
It recognizes itself as such and tolerates and rejects everything strange.
And that is why we reject a virus, a bacterium, how much more are we going to reject an entire organ.
That&#39;s why we looked for those compatibilities, to avoid those rejections.
But these genes also allowed us, precisely because we were doing it among related relatives, to analyze and establish kinship links.
We had a problem in the 1980s: we needed live cells from the two people we were going to compare, we couldn&#39;t analyze a bone.
That was a stumbling block.
But a decade later a revolution came to laboratories: now we could compare molecules.
We could extract molecules from a living cell, or a dead one, and compare them.
So we took a step forward and we could then identify a dead cell within a body or a bone remnant.
And we gain some experience.
A decade later, precisely in 2003, something happened that changed my life, largely professionally and also in motivation.
A group of women and men, anthropologists and anthropologists, from the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team arrived in Córdoba who had been walking through Argentina, exhuming graves, looking for causes of death, analyzing those bones, trying to identify them and return them to the families.
They came walking not only in Argentina, but in many countries of the world.
And they arrived in Córdoba to exhume a massive grave from the municipal cemetery of San Vicente.
A mutual friend met us at his house.
We did?
What many Argentines do when we get together: we ate a barbecue and there was also wine.
And then, having a few glasses of wine, I was shocked by the stories that these anthropologists told me because the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team is an NGO that works on cases of universal human rights violations trying to identify people.
They told me stories from all the countries, but there, at that meeting, at that barbecue with that wine, we realized that they were in a stumbling block, there was a deadlock, they needed to incorporate a new technology into this complex process of identification and it was the genetic.
So we thought of joining forces and doing something together.
I remember that at that moment we considered, let&#39;s try with the worst preserved rest of the San Vicente grave, with the most degraded, most deteriorated rest.
If we do well with that one, surely we will do well with the others.
And we did very well.
And the first identification of a skeletal remains of the dictatorship in Argentina emerged, in the San Vicente grave in Córdoba.
That filled us with joy and we said: &quot;let&#39;s set up a laboratory&quot; and that&#39;s how it was done.
We set up a genetics laboratory where there are young boys who are working, I know, a lot.
And we started walking, we summoned relatives, we began to cross letters to rewrite names.
But not only in Argentina, because in Argentina we produced some identifications, others from the San Vicente cemetery, from the &quot;La Perla&quot; torture and death center, the identification of some of the founding mothers of Plaza de Mayo, who had been thrown to the sea and that the sea had returned them.
We also went out to walk the path that they had been walking: Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, where there were also dictatorships and names and identities disappeared.
And further north, in Central America, El Salvador, the war of the 1980s, and even further north, in present-day Mexico, where thousands of migrants from many countries disappear every year, who, crossing Mexico, want to reach the dream of north country.
Also in other continents, Africa, for example, the South Africa that imprisoned Mandela.
And in Asia.
It all seems wonderful, doesn&#39;t it?
Everything went well for us.
But it&#39;s not like that.
Many times we stay in the middle.
Many times we have the remains, but so many years have passed that the relatives are no longer there.
And other times we have relatives, but the remains are not found.
And other times, even having the remains, they are so deteriorated that we cannot decipher the letters to compare them with the relatives.
That really causes a lot of frustration.
I&#39;m sure you know a very well-known, very famous, popular television series: CSI New York, Los Angeles, Miami.
In these series, the researchers, in hours, days, solve very difficult cases.
That&#39;s not true, that&#39;s fiction.
The reality is different.
We call this the &quot;CSI effect&quot; because it creates a distorted picture of the complex identification process.
The most worrying thing is that they don&#39;t just do it popularly on the people, but some government authorities also believe that it is so easy.
On top of that they are all models.
Our reality... (Laughter) is a little different.
(Laughter) (Whistling in the audience) (Laughter) (Applause) I&#39;m remembering about four or five years ago, I had to participate in a convocation that we had made in Mexico for relatives.
It was a call to a number of families who came to donate their blood samples to make a blood bank and compare the data with the number of graves that were being discovered.
It was a very solemn atmosphere.
The relatives were serious, they came to donate their blood samples.
At one point, I finished taking a sample from a mother.
stopped.
I was going to extend my hand to give it to him.
I looked at her, she was tiny, very native, dressed in her typical costume.
I extended my hand to her and she took it with both of them and brought it here like this and said: &quot;Doctorcito, please, find it for me.&quot;
(Sigh) That request is a command.
It is for this request-mandate that it is worth insisting and insisting on those complex cases that we cannot resolve.
Obsessively insisting to try to produce a new identity, to be able to rewrite a name, to return it to a family, to end the years of waiting, of uncertainty, of anguish and so that that little mother can meet her son again, even when his son is dead.
Thank you so much.
(Applause) (Cheers)
When I was five years old and starting to read, my dear grandfather Carlos Felipe gave me an adventure book.
&quot;Microbe Hunters&quot; by Paul de Kruif.
In its chapters were Leeuwenhoek, Spallanzani, Koch, the one with the bacillus, Pasteur, men who with rudimentary microscopes sought to defeat the invisible enemy.
The book did not awaken in me a vocation for medicine or chemistry, but it did awaken my passion for history.
And, as a frequent traveler to the past, I wanted to tell you something about the pandemics that hit humanity.
We could talk about the ferocious cholera of the second half of the 19th century, or the smallpox that cost so much to control.
But there are two pandemics that were very marked by their fatal consequences.
In the fourteenth century, the black plague, caused by a louse that moved on rats.
It started in Asia and from there it went to Venice, the most cosmopolitan port of its time.
That&#39;s how he got into Europe.
Mortality was between 25 and 50 million.
One out of every four Europeans was carried away by the plague.
The numbers in Asia were quite similar.
Closer in time, in the 20th century, the century of flu, we had the Spanish flu in 1918.
Spanish flu that began in the US with American soldiers preparing to leave at the end of World War I and that infected the populations of the French ports where they embarked.
From there it spread throughout the continent.
It started in the US and came to Europe through France.
Why do we call it Spanish flu?
Well, that was &quot;fake news&quot;.
The government and the press of Spain decided to confront the evil by putting the statistics on the surface.
Due to this honesty of the data and the numbers, they ended up being pointed out as responsible for something that did not correspond to them.
At that time, one in five infected died.
Look, in World War I, between 10 and 30 million people died.
The universal flu killed 50 million.
The world population fell between 2.5% and 5% because of that pandemic.
We are talking about cholera, smallpox, the black plague, the universal flu and we could also add the yellow fever of 1871, which struck the cities of Corrientes and Buenos Aires.
What did they all have in common?
That when they attacked us we weren&#39;t warned.
We were not prepared.
To make matters worse, in many of the cases it was not known where the contagion came from.
Therefore, the responses and reactions were not effective in countering the evil.
What did we learn from all those fatalities?
Something very important, that the dangerousness of the virus is enhanced by misinformation.
I explain them.
In the fourteenth century, instead of dealing with rats and poor hygiene, it was argued that the sinful lifestyle of many had unleashed divine wrath.
In the 20th century, instead of showing the true causes of that flu, reality was distorted and the bug was out of control.
In this way it spread to the five continents.
Therefore, we may have learned at once that we must deal with the truth.
As much as it hurts us.
Another of the great lessons on that occasion was that we are going to have to stay on our guard even after the storm passes.
Because there have always been second and third waves that have caught the unawares.
But, above all, we can venture wonderful times of growth.
Because after the black plague the Renaissance arose.
Because after the universal flu came the 1920s, the most fruitful and avant-garde of all time.
Yes, at the end of the tunnel, the sun awaits us.
Thank you.
I have two passions: one, soccer.
I&#39;m a megafan, let&#39;s see if you can guess which team?
(Laughter) Of course I am a megafan of Real Madrid.
I am also a goalkeeper in the Villanubla futsal team.
The other passion is: computers, video games and programming, which is what I am here to talk to you about today.
When it comes to playing, children are crazy about the Wii, the PSP, the Nintendo.
We always try to earn a few extra games, finishing homework early, tidying up our room, whatever it takes to get to the next level or beat our previous score.
One day I thought: what if instead of just playing those games I could create my own screens, heroes and bad guys, punches and stunts, extra lives?
Impossible?
No no.
A kid my age can do it.
While the new technologies are everywhere and the older ones use them for grown-up things, let&#39;s see... -- computers on board the cars (although my parents sometimes keep getting lost), cell phones, checking email, sending messages , shopping, surfing the Internet -- we children use them to play, that&#39;s why we are children and that&#39;s what we like the most.
But we all know that we children are much better at, how shall I say?, these devilish devices than many adults, perhaps because we are not afraid to touch them, to experiment with them, to see what is here or to damage them. , since then there are the parents to fix everything.
(Laughter) This curiosity that we children have helped me create my own games and I realized that I could learn by playing and play by learning.
I could experiment, create, share, understand and reason how things are made and then use it with what we were studying.
And it turns out that all that I was learning is what the elders call &quot;creative computing.&quot;
I was once told that programming is like a play: we have our stage where our actors are who will act with each other as we tell them, we can disguise them to get animations or add images, sounds, etc. You will think: it looks very good, but a child alone, in his room, programming, is not very social to say.
But it is that it is much more.
It is a public and open community worldwide, to which we can belong and where we can publish our programs or download ready-made programs to play with them, see how they have been made, modify or improve them.
And it is that, currently, in this community there are more than 10,000 shared programs, and children, not so children, and teachers from schools, institutes and universities belong to it.
I was becoming more and more passionate.
I made new friends with whom I shared creations, and I began to think that if I showed it to the children at school, they could also enjoy it as I did.
In addition, programming also helped me to learn in a more fun way what we were teaching at school.
So I was clear.
Last year, when we were teaching the bones of the human body in class, it occurred to me to do a question and answer game, which is this: (Video) I am going to show you this game that I made about the bones of the human body for my school. , when we were giving it last year, in which the human body asks you where its bones are.
We give the green flag, we put it on the big screen to make it look better, and it says: where is the jaw?
You have to answer with the correct number, if it is 10, 11, 1, 2, 3... well, you answer with 10, which is the correct one, and it tells you: &quot;good&quot; but if you answer wrong, it tells you : &quot;Whoa, whoa, whoa.&quot;
I have recorded the sounds and I have added them to the game as well, and I have made it so that there are hits and misses, that I put the numbers of the hits and misses here so that I can have competitions with my friends to see who knows the best. bones of the human body.
(Applause) I had so much fun programming it and it helped me so much to learn it that I told my teacher and asked if we could see it in class, that I wanted to show it to everyone.
So it was.
We organized a day in which I taught these projects and more to my classmates and I showed them that they could do it too, just like I had done.
How could it be otherwise, they loved it.
Children and teachers liked it so much that this year we have founded the programming club &quot;El páramo de Villanubla&quot;, where we are already 26 children who enjoy and program programs individually or in teams.
Now I am preparing this game about space: (Video) I am going to show you this game that I have made about the planets of the solar system with the video sensor, in which you have to hit the planets with your head so that they do not fall Sea.
We put it on the big screen.
I have put hits and misses and here is the sea.
The planets are falling and you point towards the camera, you move and you hit them.
When you give them, the planet is changed by its name and says it, and a hit is added.
But when you don&#39;t hit them, the sound of water sounds and a failure is added.
Well, I think you&#39;ve already seen how it works.
(Applause) Isn&#39;t that very cool?
Well, I&#39;ve done it and that&#39;s cooler for me.
I&#39;m also going to pass it on to the 5-year-olds at my school who are doing a program on the planets of the solar system and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll all learn them with it and that makes me feel happier because I know my games are useful for more things to amuse myself.
But it is not the first time that I do something for the children of my school.
Since my parents saw that I liked it so much and that my studies were going so well, when I turned 7 they gave me something that when I saw it I said: what is this?
some wires?
And they told me: &quot;With those cables you will be able to do magic.&quot;
And they were right and I&#39;m going to show you today.
It was a board called Makey Makey that by connecting it with a cable to the computer you could add more cables to things as original as jelly beans, plasticine, fruits, pencil graphite, water or, just by touching them, make programs and games work. magical way.
I told Marga, the 4-year-old teacher at my school, and she asked me if we could do a special project about music and the instruments of an orchestra.
The children and their teachers would be in charge of making the instruments out of cardboard and eva rubber, while I had to make the necessary programs so that these instruments would come to life and really sound.
So I told Juanje, a friend of mine, and between the two of us we got down to work.
We found it a very interesting project, but it was a very difficult challenge because we had to make very young children listen to us, other children.
When we had everything ready, we gathered all the little ones from the infant cycle and taught them how their instruments really sounded.
We even taught them that they too had music inside.
It was amazing!
The little ones behaved great.
We organized them in turns so that everyone could play their instruments.
Really, they looked at us as if we were magicians who, with a few simple cables and a computer, had left children and adults speechless.
Well, do you want to see how we did it?
Well, I&#39;m going to show you below.
Today I brought some of those instruments here, which, by the way, I thank my school for lending me to show you a bit of that magic, and what any child could do with a little imagination, some cables and a computer.
To play this super piano made by four-year-olds I have to take off my shoes.
I have clean feet, huh!
(Laughter) Let&#39;s see if this song sounds familiar to you.
(Music) (Applause) And now I&#39;m going to show you how water can make more sounds than it does when it comes out of the faucet.
I am going to dedicate this song to my grandmother who will have her birthday next week.
(Laughter) (Applause) (Music) (Applause) And next I&#39;m going to need four volunteers because here and now we&#39;re going to see what they sound like.
Let&#39;s see, you four from there who are very close.
(Laughter) (Applause) Get out there, you take this one and you take this one.
Let&#39;s see what instrument you sound like (Noise) Come on, you sound like a noise!
(Sound of cymbals) And you to some cymbals.
No, you don&#39;t sound.
(Laughter) (Drum sound) You sound like a drum.
And you, to see what instrument you sound like.
(Horse neighing sound) Oops, we&#39;ve got a horse on us!
(Laughter) (Applause) I hope you liked everything I&#39;ve told you.
Do you see how I did not deceive you?
You imagine, you create and you share, and all with a few cables, a bit of imagination and a computer.
Cheer up guys and girls!
Stop being just game players and become creators of stories, games, programs, musical projects...
There is no limit, only that of our imagination.
But don&#39;t stop there, show it to the world, send it to the web so that more and more of us enjoy ourselves, not only playing, but also knowing that we children can also decide how we want things to be done.
And to you, the parents, I ask you, please, to set up programming workshops in schools so that no child is left without learning all this.
It is important for your children.
(Applause) And never forget and always believe that nothing is impossible, everything depends on our effort and desire to improve ourselves, and even though we are very young, we also have many things to teach others.
Thank you so much for your attention.
See you soon.
(Applause)
Without identity we cannot be in society.
The first thing that people with disabilities lose when they are born is their identity.
They are labeled, renamed, by a diagnosis that does not speak of the person.
Stripping of identity is the beginning of a series of humiliations according to the culture, the context, the circumstances, which is repeated throughout the history of humanity.
And the school reproduces what the Spartans do when they ask, in the presence of a student with a disability, what does he have?
But naming is an act of resistance.
And so the body becomes a sign.
And our children and our youth can be recognized.
So the correct question is who is it?
The school has the power to name.
The school returns identity.
It has the power to return the condition of person.
As simple as that: School dignifies.
So, if we dream of an inclusive society, the key is in the school.
(Applause) (Cheers)
I have a daughter who is 13 years old, but in 2012, when there was the financial collapse, when all the world&#39;s stock markets fell and all that, she was five years younger than now, she would be eight, nine years old.
And we were watching the news, we were having lunch and watching the news and a guy with a bald tie appeared, a journalist who always gave bad news, he was the one who predicted the tsunami and that a plane crashed, and that day he said: &quot;Last moment, The stock market crashed all over the world.
And my daughter looked at me like that and I turned pale.
And the guy continued, he says: &quot;The nominal value of the bond skyrocketed for not being able to sustain the debt obligations.&quot;
And my daughter was looking at me.
(Laughter) &quot;Investment banking collapsed,&quot; he said, &quot;shareholders are committing suicide.&quot;
And my daughter&#39;s eyes widened and so did I.
Obviously I freaked out because something serious was happening.
And then Nina, my daughter, who always asked me what the tsunami is, what the plane that crashed was, and it was easy to explain the tsunami: it&#39;s the epicenter of something in the sea that later the Filipinos die, it&#39;s simple .
(Laughter) He asked me: &quot;What is this that happened now, dad, is it serious?&quot;
And I realized that I had no idea how to explain to a boy what that was.
An earthquake is easy to explain, but how do you explain the collapse of the financial system to a child?
You can&#39;t explain it to him because it&#39;s intangible, more than anything.
But since I am &quot;hard-headed&quot; and in my free time I am also a writer, I decided to do it, so I wrote a children&#39;s story.
And the next day, when we were watching the news again and he asked me again, I told him a story that I want to share with you. I told Nina that day that once upon a time there was a very quiet town and that there was a boy named Pepe, the protagonist, who lived in the house furthest away from the town.
One afternoon, Pepe went for a walk and got thirsty.
When he returned home, he opened a bottle of wine, and as he drank the wine, he discovered one thing that no one had ever discovered before: there were no bars in the town.
There wasn&#39;t even a bar.
Pepe thought that if he opened a bar, he could make others happy, giving them a drink, and he also thought that he could earn some money.
And he was happy with the idea of opening a bar.
That afternoon, his friend, Moncho, stopped by Pepe&#39;s house and gave him a good name for the bar.
And it is already known that when an outdated idea has a name, that idea is already beginning to take shape.
So Pepe made a list of needs to open the first bar in town.
Nina was looking at me with wide eyes, the story was fine so far.
Pepe realized that they had to buy tables, chairs, glasses, paint, a palenque so that the bar&#39;s customers could place their horses and go in to have a drink.
And he took out the accounts and all that was going to cost him about 10,000 coins.
Of course, Pepe didn&#39;t have 10,000 coins because he was poor, but overnight he came up with a way to get those 10,000 coins.
Pepe cut out 1000 pieces of paper and wrote on each piece of paper the phrase: &quot;Coming soon, Pepe&#39;s Bar&quot;; 1000 times he wrote that.
And on Sunday, after mass, he went to the town square dressed in his best suit and told all the neighbors in the square: &quot;Dear neighbors, I&#39;m going to open a bar on the outskirts of town.&quot;
Everyone looked at him.
&quot;What a good idea!&quot;
some said.
Pepe felt very good with everyone&#39;s attention and then he showed, in a fan, the 1000 cut-out pieces of paper and said: --&quot;this is important, Nina&quot; I told him- Pepe said: &quot;Each of these 1000 pieces of paper costs 10 coins&quot;.
The neighbors looked at him.
&quot;Whoever buys me a piece of paper is going to have to keep it because in a month, when I open my bar, I&#39;m going to pay 12 coins for each piece of paper that you give me back.&quot;
Then there were whispers in the whole square and Moncho, who was the town idiot, asked: &quot;Stop it, Pepe!
But doesn&#39;t each piece of paper cost 10 coins?
Why are you going to give away two more coins later?&quot;
And Pepe said: &quot;It&#39;s not giving away, Mocho, it&#39;s compensating.
I am going to compensate with two more coins to those who help me fulfill my dream, which is to open a bar&quot;.
Then the mayor, who was around, came over and said, &quot;Makes sense!
It makes a lot of sense.
Very good, Pepe!&quot;
And Ernesto, who was rich and understood business, said: &quot;The idea seems very good to me.&quot;
And the priest Ricardo, taking out some coins from under his cassock, said: &quot;It&#39;s a very Christian idea!
I want some of your papers.&quot;
And everyone began to buy Pepe&#39;s papers.
In that simple way, and in a single morning, Pepe got the money to open his bar.
Among all the neighbors they bought him the 1000 pieces of paper.
&quot;I bought him two,&quot; said Sabino, who was poor but optimistic.
&quot;I bought him 36&quot; shouted Quique who was greedy and arrogant.
Pepe went home with 10,000 coins in his backpack and fell asleep thinking about his dream: opening a bar.
The next day was Monday and Pepe traveled to the city and bought wood to build a counter and bought paint, he returned home and went to work.
He did not go through the town square for the next four weeks.
That is to say, I told Nina, Pepe didn&#39;t find out about the disaster that was going to happen because of his pieces of paper.
At that point in the story I stopped and stared at my daughter to see if she was understanding the story.
You always have to &quot;test&quot; metaphors with kids, especially when they are complex ideas, and she told me: &quot;Dad, this has nothing to do with what the bald guy on &#39;TV&#39; said, but it&#39;s good, I followed&quot;.
(Laughter) So I told him.
I told him what happened in the village during the first week.
That Monday, the square was full of people, much more than on a normal Monday.
Many neighbors had spent the whole night cutting their own pieces of paper because, they had also discovered, they had projects that they could not carry out due to lack of coins.
Some pieces of paper said: &quot;Shortly, Horacio&#39;s Ice Cream Parlor.&quot;
Other pieces of paper said: &quot;Very soon, Carmen&#39;s Hairdresser.&quot;
And there were even some slips of paper written by Moncho with misspellings, which said: &quot;At the end of the month, I will travel to the Moon.&quot;
(Laughter) Suddenly, the residents would get on the lampposts in the square so that the other residents could buy those pieces of paper.
They climbed to the fountain to exchange pieces of paper for coins.
Tuesday was even worse and on Wednesday it was no longer possible to walk through the &quot;quilombo&quot; square that existed.
The mayor had to put order and set up a closed place in the municipality so that the neighbors could meet to exchange pieces of paper without destroying the square.
This small place was inaugurated on Thursday and was baptized with the name of &quot;el salón de los papelitos&quot;.
And so it was that on Friday, all those who had a project had already obtained the necessary coins to carry it out and had started to work.
Horacio was already looking for milk, cream, ice for his ice cream shop, Pepe was already sawing the wood for the bar counter.
Carmen was sharpening the scissors for her brand new hairdresser&#39;s and Moncho had bought two skinny horses to take trips to the Moon.
(Laughter) Only a group of neighbors who had never thought of any interesting project in their lives remained in the little paper room.
The only thing these neighbors had were pieces of paper from other people.
One of these neighbors, Ramón, complained loudly: &quot;Wow!&quot;
said.
&quot;Now I need coins to buy cigarettes and I don&#39;t have them.
A few days ago, I exchanged my last 10 coins for a piece of Pepe&#39;s paper and now I need to smoke.&quot;
&quot;The same thing happens to me,&quot; said Luis, &quot;I want to go to the movies, I don&#39;t have a coin.&quot;
The complaints grew until Sabino, who was cunning, raised his piece of paper and said: &quot;Let&#39;s see, guys, in three weeks, Pepe is going to pay 12 coins to whoever returns this piece of paper that I bought for 10.
I&#39;m selling my piece of paper right now for eight coins!&quot;
And the others looked at him, they said &quot;Oh!&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a deal,&quot; Ernesto said that he was rich, but he wanted to be even richer and he took the piece of paper out of his hands for eight coins.
Ramón and Luis also sold their little papers for less than 10 coins and, while one ran to buy cigarettes and the other went to the movies, the other neighbors saw that this was a new way of doing business, although they had never in their lives thought of it. a real idea occurred.
Some climbed on the chairs, others on the tables.
They began to offer what they had and even the priest Ricardo arrived from the church sad and said: &quot;Friends, the day Moncho put his little papers up for sale, I, who am a Christian, bought him a few because he is stupid.
Now Moncho sells them for 7 coins and says that he is going to return 20 coins, but he is stupid and wants to take trips to the Moon.
Now I need coins to fix the bell tower and nobody wants to buy Moncho&#39;s papers from me.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Father Ricardo&quot; they all said, &quot;we can&#39;t buy.
How is that boy going to go to the moon?&quot;
Then the priest left the room with Moncho&#39;s papers, his head down, and it was the first time in many years that no one was helping him repair the church.
And so the first week passed.
Then I looked at Nina, who told me: &quot;Now it seems to me that it&#39;s starting to look like what the guy on TV said.&quot;
And I say &quot;Sure!
In the real world, the room of the slips is called &#39;the stock market&#39;, while the slips can have two names.
They may be called &#39;bonds&#39;, in some countries, in other countries they are called &#39;debentures&#39;.
The 12 coins that Pepe is going to pay when the bar works, or the 20 coins that Moncho says he is going to pay when he travels to the Moon, are called the &#39;nominal value of the bond.
And Nina looked at me like that.
(Laughter) His eyes widened because he understood the girl, eight years old.
So I told him what happened the second week in the village.
I told him that Pepe&#39;s house no longer seemed like a house, Pepe&#39;s house seemed like something else.
In the dining room there was a wooden bar, the bathroom had been converted into two bathrooms, one for ladies, one for men.
The walls were half painted navy blue and Pepe was very happy with the progress of his bar.
Since Pepe had not yet gone to town, he still did not know that the life of his neighbors was a &quot;quilombo&quot; of little pieces of paper that came and went, changing prices and owners.
Even the mayor, after discussing it with his secretary, decided to join the new trend.
One Tuesday morning, the mayor came out onto the balcony with a megaphone and said: &quot;Neighbors, the square was damaged after the furor of the little pieces of paper.
I need to raise funds to fix the damaged lampposts, to renovate the fountain and to buy a motor car.
From this moment on, I&#39;m putting 1000 official slips on sale.&quot;
&quot;How many coins are they?&quot;
Sabine asked.
&quot;No coins!&quot;
Said the mayor, &quot;my pieces of paper cost a horse.
When the fountain pours water, when the streetlights give light again and I have a motor car, I&#39;m going to return two horses for a piece of paper.
The official slips are on sale from now on, run they&#39;re over.&quot;
The mayor&#39;s slips were sold in record time.
Everyone in the town handed over their horses to the mayor and, from that day on, the tasks began to be done on foot.
Meanwhile, the exchange of little pieces of paper continued to increase and there were no longer enough pencils to write down who owned what.
Some little pieces of paper were highly desired, for example, those of Pepe who worked day and night concreting his bar, but nobody wanted other little pieces of paper, for example, those of Moncho because his device to travel to the Moon, for At the time, it only consisted of two horses and a cart.
No one believed that it would start to take off.
Ernesto, the rich neighbor who had bought a lot of papers during the first week, now wanted to get rid of Moncho&#39;s papers.
And, since he also had Pepe&#39;s pieces of paper, he invented something terrific which he baptized: &quot;Ernesto&#39;s wads.&quot;
They were sealed packages with 100 pieces of paper of all colors.
For example, there were 10 pieces of paper from Pepe&#39;s bar upstairs, 20 pieces of paper from Horacio&#39;s ice cream parlor in the middle, and 70 pieces of paper from Moncho&#39;s lunar project downstairs, without anyone seeing them.
On Thursday of the second week, Ernesto&#39;s wads were a great success among the neighbors who were looking for little papers from Pepe or the mayor like crazy, but on Friday, Quique discovered the trick and said: &quot;Watch out, neighbors, watch out!
Ernesto&#39;s bundles sometimes come with pieces of paper from Pepe or the mayor on top and that&#39;s fine, but at the bottom of the package there are many pieces of paper from Moncho who will never in the fucking life make a trip to the Moon.
So before you buy wads from Ernesto, seek my advice.
My fee for each tip is two coins.&quot;
(Laughter) Since then, buyers of little papers have always consulted Quique before buying bundles from Ernesto.
Ernesto and Quique, who had been friends for many years, stopped talking to each other forever.
And so the second week passed.
By now, Nina was pretty much an expert on this whole thing.
I explained to him that in the real world the mayor&#39;s official papers are called &quot;public debt securities.&quot;
I explained to him that Ernesto&#39;s bundles are called &quot;debt obligations&quot;, while Quique&#39;s house, the place where the neighbors go to find out if they trust Ernesto&#39;s bundles or not, is called &quot;investment banking&quot;. .
I then told Nina that when the third week in the village began, some projects were almost finished and others were still in their infancy.
Pepe only needed to nail the fence so that the neighbors&#39; horses would graze outside the bar.
Horacio had managed to mix milk and fruit for his ice cream parlor and all he had to do was bring bars of ice from the city.
On the other hand, Carmen had not yet found a good place to set up her hairdressing salon, although she already had dozens of sharp scissors.
And what about Moncho?
Poor Moncho.
His horses grew thinner and sadder, though he brushed them day and night, and his contraption did not seem to fly for less than a week.
The neighbors who had pieces of paper from Moncho or Carmen were restless and could no longer sell them to anyone.
Until Quique appeared with a great idea.
&quot;Hey!&quot;
Quique said.
&quot;Those who still have Moncho&#39;s pieces of paper, don&#39;t worry.
I can sell you &quot;Quique&#39;s tranquility&quot; for those pieces of paper.
&quot;And what is that?
&quot;Asked Sabino who had many pieces of paper from Moncho.
&quot;Very easy,&quot; said Quique.
&quot;Whoever has Moncho&#39;s papers pays me two coins every night between now and the end of the month and if Moncho can&#39;t make trips to the Moon, I pay the 20 coins Moncho promised.&quot;
&quot;Even if Moncho fails?&quot;
they all asked.
&quot;Even if I fail!
Quique said.
&quot;Great idea!
&quot;said Sabino, &quot;this way we will feel much calmer and we will be able to buy more papers from the town idiot.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s why my idea is called &#39;Quique&#39;s tranquility&#39;,&quot; said Quique.
And many neighbors began to pay Quique two coins a night to secure Moncho&#39;s project.
In the midst of the euphoria over these new ideas, no one in town noticed that the mayor had never fixed the streetlights or the fountain in the plaza.
The mayor had fulfilled only part of his promise: he had escaped from town with a motor car.
It was all he had done.
And the only horses left in the town were Moncho&#39;s.
All the others had been taken by the mayor.
The secretary, who had been the mayor&#39;s right hand and knew about the scam from the beginning, decided to do something so that nobody discovers the absence of his boss.
And his idea was great: He brought a blackboard to the room with little pieces of paper and began to give a grade, from one to ten, to each project.
He gave Pepe&#39;s bar an eight, Carmen&#39;s hairdresser he gave a five, Horacio&#39;s ice cream parlor a seven.
He gave the vehicle to make trips to Luna de Moncho a two and, pretending to be distracted, he gave the reforms to the mayor&#39;s square a nine and fifty.
&quot;What do these numbers mean?
Sabine asked.
And the secretary said: &quot;These are the possibilities of concretion of each project.
It&#39;s to help, I do it for you.&quot; And so the third week passed.
At this point, I explained to Nina that in the real world, Quique&#39;s idea of offering peace of mind about Moncho&#39;s little pieces of paper is called &quot;debt default insurance&quot; and the big blackboard where the secretary puts a note on each project In the real world, it&#39;s called &quot;rating agencies,&quot; which are sometimes wrong on purpose and sometimes wrong on purpose.
Then Nina asked me if Pepe had finally managed to open his bar because we were already in the fourth week and I told her the end of the story.
The end of the story goes like this: When the fourth week came and the month was up, Pepe got up very early and walked calmly to the town.
In the distance, the facade of his bar was seen with the illuminated sign at full blast.
The bar was called &quot;La Luna&quot;, as Moncho had baptized it the first day.
Now all that remained was for the neighbors to arrive on horseback, their throats dead with thirst.
Pepe traveled the five leagues to the town putting signs on all the trees along the way: &quot;Bar La Luna, open every night.&quot;
Each poster that he put up, he would go away and remain proud looking at the poster.
However, when he arrived at the town square, he did not understand anything about what was happening.
He thought he had taken the wrong turn and was in a different town.
It seemed that the war had passed through that town.
The lampposts and the fountain in the square were destroyed, there was not a single horse in the streets and the neighbors walked around talking to themselves.
&quot;What happened here?&quot;
Pepe asked Horacio when he saw him.
&quot;Oh!
Pepe&quot; said Horacio crying.
&quot;Oh Pepe.
Everyone went crazy with the pieces of paper, with mine, with Carmen&#39;s, with yours, with everyone.
Suddenly, there began to be more pieces of paper than coins and the mayor ran away from town.
After that there were no more coins.
Later the horses disappeared.
Ernesto&#39;s bundle vendors went bankrupt.
Quique&#39;s peace of mind resellers couldn&#39;t pay anyone and they escaped into the night.
We are in ruins, Pepe.&quot;
&quot;And your ice cream project?&quot;
Pepe asked.
&quot;And Carmen&#39;s hairdresser?&quot;
&quot;No, mine was a failure&quot; Horacio said.
&quot;There are no horses to fetch ice from the city and the ice cream melts.
And Carmen has no clients.
Everyone is tearing their hair out for themselves.
What do you want a hairdresser for?&quot;
Pepe was silent, he couldn&#39;t believe what they were telling him.
Then Horace said: &quot;Oh, by God!
I need something strong.&quot;
And Luis said: &quot;Me too, my throat is dry.&quot;
And Sabino asked: &quot;Pepe, did you open the bar you wanted to open or not?&quot;
And others also came to ask about the bar.
Pepe then discovered that, without a horse, no one would ever be able to go to his bar on the outskirts of town and he also understood that he could never return the 10,000 coins to anyone.
And then he saw Moncho in the middle of the square.
Moncho&#39;s two skinny horses were the only animals left and they drew three carts, each with two wheels, in the shape of a train.
Many neighbors were getting into those cars and others made a long line, waiting to get on.
&quot;Moncho!&quot;
asked Pepe, &quot;where are all these people going?&quot;
And Moncho said: &quot;Where is it going to be?
To your bar!
To the moon&quot;.
Pepe saw a sign hanging on the broken fountain that said: &quot;Moncho makes trips to La Luna.
Outputs: one coin.
Return: free.&quot;
&quot;But Moncho!&quot;
asked Pepe, &quot;did you know that everyone was going to lose their horse?&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; Moncho said, &quot;I only know one thing: what I do know is that people can go to a bar on horseback, but no one can come back drunk and riding a horse.&quot;
&quot;And since I don&#39;t drink, I thought my business could be taking them to and from La Luna.&quot;
Then Pepe hugged Moncho, got into the first car and yelled: &quot;Let&#39;s all go to La Luna!
Free drinks the first night&quot;, and the whole town came up and applauded.
Nina even clapped happily at the end of the story.
And so I told my daughter to be careful because in the real world the stories of the Pepes who try to open bars, or the stories of the Monchos who want to take trips to the Moon and nobody understands them, are almost always projects that do not They usually have a happy ending like in children&#39;s stories.
Because Quiques appear in the middle, mayors appear, Ernestos and secretaries appear and they always spoil everything.
But when one of these projects does work, I told my daughter to finish, when these projects work, when something magical happens and they work, they are called &quot;dreams&quot; and they are usually wonderful.
(Applause) Thank you very much.
(Applause)
You probably remember this image of Chancellor Angela Merkel taking a selfie with a refugee.
This image and others like it raised blisters in the German parliament and in many European parliaments, putting the European Union in check.
From the beginning there was no consensus among the German population in the face of such an avalanche of refugees from the Middle East, on their way to Europe.
The welcoming culture fostered by Angela Merkel from the beginning was not always appreciated by everyone.
From the beginning there were people who supported her and others who didn&#39;t.
There are more and more people who do not currently support her, there are more and more detractors, and this is going to take its toll on Angela Merkel, obviously.
I do not want to go into details about the political future of Angela Merkel, but I would like to mention that she, for me, is one of the political people today who has a moral authority despite her mistakes, which the most current politicians.
This is a graph showing the number of refugees who entered Germany over the past year.
The first group is from Syria, followed by the group that came from Iraq, and the group that came from Afghanistan.
According to a UNICEF report published just two weeks ago, half of the people fleeing war are minors.
The discourse against refugees is well known: &quot;They are going to Islamize us.&quot;
&quot;We are letting terrorists in.&quot;
&quot;We are losing identity.&quot;
And it is true that there are also people who are very in favor of or empathize with people who are fleeing the war, but I can also verify that among these people there is a kind of hiding behind the mistakes of politicians in order not to act, to not participate in initiatives that can, if not resolve, at least alleviate these very serious personal dramas.
In the informal discourse and in the official discourse, learning German is highlighted as key to the integration of refugees.
I am from Barcelona, I am a linguist.
I have been living in Cologne, Germany for four years, and learning the language is also a key factor for me in order to be able to integrate, but it is not only a key factor for refugees, but for all immigrants in general.
I have been researching different aspects of language in multilingual environments for several years, and for me language is not a final product that can be mastered.
For me, language is a process that changes throughout life, through the personal experiences we have.
Obviously, language is a powerful instrument of integration, of inclusion, but also a powerful instrument of social exclusion.
If, for example, you have poor linguistic competence or you have a foreign accent, or a certain dialect of a region, or, perhaps, you have some type of disability that affects the production of oral language, such as , stuttering, these are all examples that influence how people will accept you or marginalize you in a society.
The use of language and identity is not something static, it is something that changes.
It is not like fingerprints, which is what accompanies you all your life.
Identity is something that is created or forged based on the values and beliefs that your family gives you, your friends give you, and it also depends on what you really want to be, and what you really want to be depends on depending on your motivation, the feeling of belonging that you have with other groups with which you feel related or identified and also depending on the interactions with groups that are totally different from you.
Free German classes are offered in refugee centers in Germany, and one might think, it is natural to think, that these people should be happy to be able to receive these German courses and also that they should be grateful.
But the absence of adolescent girls in these German groups, in these activities, is really significant.
Put yourself in a situation: these girls carry a lot of burden, many post-traumatic disorders, due to an exodus, to a land that no one had promised them, they have seen their loved ones murdered, they have seen their houses burned or bombed, unfortunately others have also been witnesses or victims of violations in their particular movement from Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria on their way to Europe, or on the way in this case to Germany.
If you put yourself in their shoes, would you want to take German classes or anything else?
To make matters worse, the families of these girls, parents, brothers or other relatives, prevent them from participating in these activities because they think that, perhaps, they will harm them even more.
And the question is: what to do so that these girls begin to participate in this new society and that they can integrate?
This is the question four of our friends asked ourselves: with the red sweater, Sandra, then there&#39;s me, Lina and Peter.
The four of us, for different reasons, have a lot to do with adolescence.
Peter and I, for having fifteen-year-old daughters.
And Sandra and Lina, for also working with this group, adolescence.
We thought: what if we do a project where it is not only attractive for refugee girls, but also attractive for German girls?
Could we get them together?
Could we create a space for them to interact and perhaps with that we could contribute to transforming their identity?
This is how the HalloFoto! initiative was born.
It is an intercultural project for adolescent girls between 13 and 17 years old.
The objectives of this project were: to develop... well, first to create these spaces for interaction in order to develop communication skills.
And the creative powers of the girls.
We thought: if we develop both things, surely we will create the possibility that they also develop intercultural competences.
Obviously, to develop communication skills you had to go through learning German, there was no other option, and we used an innovative method: augmentative communication boards.
Augmentative communication boards are aids for people who are non-verbal, that is, people who do not have oral language.
This condition can occur from birth, for example in the case of children with severe autism spectrum disorders, or for example in children with cerebral palsy.
This condition can also occur when you are an adult, because you have a stroke or because you have an accident, or because you suffer from a neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson&#39;s.
These boards that we used for the project are made up of pictograms and the core vocabulary.
The core vocabulary is the words that are repeated the most in the spontaneous language and this happens not only in German, but also in Spanish, Catalan, Basque, English, etc.
The truth is that the girls accepted these instruments very well, and the data collected in the project show that, yes, they value it positively.
In any case, for them this is not the determining factor to learn German, to have dreams, to be motivated, to really want to participate in this new society.
For them, what is really significant are the meetings that we form, that we organize in HalloFoto!, in our project.
They are intercultural encounters because we were encouraging face-to-face interaction between groups with totally different frames of reference.
This, for example, is the image of one of the meetings.
We organize these intercultural meetings by theme and the themes were decided by them.
This is the theme &quot;Makeup and hairdressing&quot;.
In another of the meetings we went to an adventure center where there were zip lines, there were balancing games, tunnels.
The issue was not creating fear, but overcoming fear.
Together they helped each other, and it was not a question of who was more or less afraid, which group was the most or least afraid, it was simply each one in their expression.
You can see it in their faces, they can&#39;t define who is who, the one who is afraid.
The point is that in this, along with other meetings... —This is the meeting we did about cooking. —they see meaning.
And it is in this construction of meaning what generates a sensation of miscegenation, a sensation of creating links, intercultural developments that go beyond labels.
The only thing that labels do is generate stereotypes and generate prejudices that do not account for the great wealth that each of us is, or that each of us has.
In addition to communication skills, we also wanted to develop creative skills.
Creativity is the affective and cognitive expression of each individual.
And if we activate that expression jointly, first, a space develops to generate things, initially unthinkable, which are mixtures of expressions where one can already begin to see how an intercultural competence is being forged.
That is why these photography workshops were made, to generate this creativity.
The photography workshops were given by Peter and Sandra, who are the group&#39;s photographers.
And these are the photos that the girls took throughout the project.
Sometimes they posed and sometimes they were photographers, they decided.
And when you see these photos you think: where is the &quot;they&quot;?
where is the &quot;we&quot;?
The borders are very diluted.
How do we define ourselves?
We found the photos so precious that we thought we should do an exhibition.
But we didn&#39;t want to do a typical exhibition, we didn&#39;t want to do an exhibition in a museum or in an art gallery.
We wanted to transfer our photos, our exhibition, to an urban space and we had a vision.
This is the computer recreation of our vision: we wanted our girls to be on a tram, the tram of desire.
Our desire was to have a platform, a platform that would be a political statement against sexism and against xenophobia.
We presented it to public transport in Cologne and they were quite enthusiastic about the project.
And in early July, last July, the trolley with the photos of the girls was presented.
(Applause) The project was much more successful than we imagined.
In fact, the press highlighted us as an exemplary project, to counter the xenophobic tendencies that are sadly increasing, not only in Germany, but throughout Europe.
Likewise, there were many people who asked us if they could replicate the project, if they could make their special HalloFoto!.
And for this reason we thought: we are going to license it, so that everyone can use it.
That is why the project is in Creative Commons, and from this stage, from TEDxValladolid, I invite all those who want to participate and launch their own project to do so.
(Applause) And it&#39;s not what we, the four people on the team, have taught, but what the girls have taught us.
All the group participants have shown us ways to communicate and ways to interact.
First, that they break stereotypes.
Second, that they create bridges.
That they have also generated transformed, powerful and intercultural identities, and these intercultural identities are not based on consensus, but on mutual respect, on that mutual respect of empathizing with the other, of putting oneself in the other&#39;s shoes, to So have that feeling of belonging.
And that feeling of belonging is what I have been feeling before you while I was telling you all this, and for this I am very grateful.
(Applause)
What comes to your mind when you hear the words post-traumatic stress disorder?
Maybe words like war, violence or army.
Post-traumatic stress disorder is a mental disorder that can develop after experiencing or witnessing life-threatening events, such as war, accidents, assaults, or natural disasters.
Symptoms may include: nightmares, flashbacks, difficulty concentrating, difficulty sleeping, avoiding things and places, and negative thoughts. What comes to mind when I ask you, what is mental health?
Maybe you are thinking about: Depressed... me?
I do not have that!
Hospital, or how does our mind work?
During the summer of 2016, I traveled alone to Amsterdam, before studying in Salamanca, in Spain.
I visited the Anne Frank house.
As I walked through the halls and floors, I looked at the pictures and the stories.
At one point I just stood there... and cried.
I was moved by what I saw and read.
No one thought this was strange, nor did they speak to me when they saw me cry.
In this space, I felt like I could do it, and I stayed there for as long as I could.
No one knew that my reason for entering this site was to find a place to cry, where no one would ask me why.
No one knew, at the time, that I was crying because I had been sexually assaulted.
This feeling of fear, shame, led me to remain silent, to find comfort in a place where crying seemed okay.
I came home wanting to erase this memory forever, but everything changed quickly.
I began to experience panic attacks, often triggering images, places, and news, which reminded me of the assault.
I felt guilty and ashamed, I felt empty and alone.
And even though I saw myself as someone who had everything under control, deep inside, I was falling apart.
Don&#39;t tell, they&#39;ll think you&#39;re crazy!
Why did you walk alone?
Why did you travel alone?
But why did you put yourself in this situation?
How are you today?
This.
This helped me decide to seek help.
When I started having suicidal thoughts, my best friend told me that help was available and connected me to the health and psychological services at the university.
When I had panic attacks, I had friends who were only a text or call away.
They didn&#39;t have to say anything, they just listened.
The support, the acceptance, and having someone close, allowed me to seek that help.
Over time, I got the help I needed and was able to recover from PTSD.
According to the World Health Organization, about 800,000 people die by suicide each year.
In 2016 there were 3,569 suicides in Spain, according to the National Statistics Institute.
Almost ten people a day, one every two and a half hours.
Suicide is preventable and while not all of us are experts, psychologists or psychiatrists, we all have the power to make a difference in someone&#39;s life, and we play a critical role in creating change.
it can be as simple as listening.
Yes, it is important to risk speaking out loud for those who have experienced or are experiencing trauma.
But, if my friend hadn&#39;t risked asking me how I was, maybe I would never have spoken.
I challenge you to break down the barrier between those who are struggling and those who aren&#39;t, because no one has to feel ashamed of not being okay.
Each one of us has to take a risk and reach out, and ask, How are you today?
Thank you.
(Applause)
How nice to be here.
(Applause) (End of applause) I&#39;ve always wondered where the rhythm is.
Will it be in the ear?
Will it be in what I hear?
Or is it in what I see?
And then, talking on the phone with me, I realize... How?
That in what I see
Around me there are so many rhythms.
And if I were deaf, couldn&#39;t I move?
Of course, Maria!
Because the rhythm is outside in what you see.
And it&#39;s inside your body.
I&#39;m dropping something.
Yes, the pants.
They have put me so many cables to talk to you.
(Laughter) But they forgot that I have pants.
(Applause) Yes, I have.
I want to tell you that there is nothing like a smile.
When someone approaches me and says: &quot;I want to dance&quot;.
Clear.
Now you can dance.
With what?
With what you have
Oh!
I see a mirror in my hand.
oh!
The mirror tells me yes... you can.
And what is time?
Time is in doing and giving.
What I have inside is useless if I don&#39;t have the possibility of giving to the other.
So that in turn find paths and movement.
Maria, and the rhythm?
It&#39;s inside you.
When you breathe; (Exhalation) You already have rhythm inside.
When you see, the rhythm is outside.
I am full of colored lights that speak to me, they are stars.
Stars that illuminate, illuminate this afternoon.
No, Maria, it&#39;s the day.
No, it seems night.
Because the stars light up when it&#39;s night.
And what is the day?
Having stars in our hands that look at us and speak to us.
Can this be given?
Of course!
Because it&#39;s inside you.
It is within each look.
In every move we make is the rhythm you&#39;ve created.
The rhythm is out of your body, but how beautiful what I have on the ground.
Is a circle.
Wonderful.
It has no doors.
The circle has no gates.
I don&#39;t know where to go.
But how am I up here?
They have brought me.
They have brought me here to get closer to you.
And tell them you can.
Do not be afraid.
If I can&#39;t do this, I can do another.
If I can&#39;t make another, I can make the other.
I am the other.
I&#39;m here to give you what you don&#39;t say you have.
What do you have?
Life.
What is life?
It&#39;s what I don&#39;t know.
It&#39;s what I want to find.
It&#39;s what I want to find.
And only movement will help me.
That&#39;s why I ask you, if the word is movement and in my body there is a rhythm that I don&#39;t hear, you know?
I&#39;m deaf.
I don&#39;t know what the sound of the word is.
But I know, deaf as I am, I can feel the infinite rhythm that moves my body.
And I like to dance, you know?
I have always wanted to dance.
Because I always see the movement.
The movement, do you know when it starts?
When I open my eyes in the morning and say: &quot;How beautiful is the day that is waiting for me!&quot;
Today is my day.
Thank you.
(Applause)
She just received a document letter.
She supposes that they ask her to pay or to leave and she thinks about the boys, she thinks about her job, she thinks about the partner who abandoned her; he opens it and reads.
He doesn&#39;t understand, he can&#39;t understand.
They are asking him to leave now, to leave now, the boys are not there, things are scattered.
Today I would have nowhere to sleep.
If I had a translator on the phone, without losing any information, I could read this.
[Pay within 48 hours, otherwise you will be sued.]
And she would remain calm, and perhaps she would go to the Justice Access Center where they would tell her that she has time and that they are going to help her.
But there is no translator from legal language to a language that we all understand.
Google says it&#39;s too expensive for the few of us in the law-making community.
The letter is not understood but sends two messages.
The first is &quot;I put a lawyer.&quot;
The conflict escalated and now we can&#39;t resolve it by chatting.
The second is darker.
The second says &quot;You
It&#39;s outside the language of the law.&quot;
The language belongs to the lawyers and to the lawyers, to the judges and to the judges, but not to you.
Since she is going to have to fix herself somehow, we all know that many times in Argentina, &quot;some way&quot; is outside the law.
So that this does not happen, I am part of the Argentine Network of Clear Language, where we try to bring the language of the law closer to everyday language.
After all, the law in a democracy is ours.
(Applause)
Today, in this place, we are approximately 5,000 women.
1250 of us suffered or will suffer a sexual assault at some point in their lives.
1 in 4.
Only 10% will make the complaint.
The remaining 90% take refuge in silence.
One half, because the event occurs within the family or with someone known and that makes it much more difficult to live and tell.
The other half do not speak because they are afraid that they will not be believed.
And they are right, because we do not believe them.
Today I want to tell you why I think we don&#39;t believe them.
We don&#39;t believe them because when a woman tells what happened to her, she says things that we can&#39;t imagine, that disturb us, that we don&#39;t expect to hear, that surprise us.
We look forward to hearing stories like this.
&quot;Young woman raped on the tracks of the Miter Railroad.
It happened at midnight when he was coming home.
The young woman said that a subject assaulted her from behind, told her not to scream, that he had a weapon, to stay still.
He raped her and then ran away.&quot;
When we hear or read news like this, an image immediately comes to mind: the rapist, a low-class depraved; the victim, a young, attractive woman.
The image does not last more than 10 or 20 seconds and it is dark, it is flat; there are no movements, there are no sounds, it is as if there were no people.
But when a woman tells what happened to her, her story doesn&#39;t fit in 10 or 20 seconds.
The following is the testimony of a woman whom we are going to call Ana.
One of the 85 women I interviewed in the course of an investigation I did on rape.
Ana says: &quot;We had gone with the girls from the office to the same pub that we always go to.
We met some kids and I got hooked on a skinny re piola.
We talk a lot.
At around 4 I told my friends to leave; they wanted to stay.
Then, the skinny man asked me where I lived and told me that if it was okay with me, he would bring me closer.
I accepted and we left.
At a traffic light he told me that he liked me and touched my leg.
I don&#39;t like a guy moving forward like that, but he had been loving all night.
I thought: &quot;I can&#39;t be so paranoid, I say something to him and the guy has nothing to do with it and I offend him.&quot;
When he had to turn, he kept going.
I thought he was wrong and I said, &#39;You went too far!
&#39;, but I felt something ugly.
Now I think, why didn&#39;t I pay attention to what I felt?
When he stopped the car near the highway, that&#39;s when I was scared.
But he told me to stay calm, that he liked me, that nothing would happen if I didn&#39;t want to; he spoke to me well.
I didn&#39;t say anything to him because I was afraid that he would get angry and everything would be worse.
I thought you might have a gun in the glove compartment.
Suddenly he jumped on me and wanted to kiss me.
I told him: &#39;No!
&#39;; I wanted to push him, but he had my arms.
When I let go I tried to open the door, but it was stuck.
Anyway, if he got out of the car, where was he going?
I told him that he wasn&#39;t the kind of guy who needed to do that to be with a woman; I liked him too, but not in that way.
She tried to calm him down, she said nice things about him.
I spoke to him as if I were his older sister.
Suddenly, he covered my mouth with one hand and with the other he unbuckled his belt.
At that moment I thought that I could kill myself, hang myself, you know?
I never felt so alone, like kidnapped.
I asked him to finish quickly and take me home.&quot;
What happened to you listening to this story?
Surely, several questions appeared to them.
For example, why didn&#39;t you roll down your window and call for help?
Why didn&#39;t you get out of the car when you had a feeling that something ugly could happen?
How could she ask him to take her home?
Now, when we are not facing news in the media, facing a story that someone like me tells them from a stage like this; When we are in front of someone we know and who chose us to entrust us with their story, what happened to them, we are going to have to listen to it.
And we are going to hear things that we are not going to be able to understand or accept.
Then doubts, questions, suspicions will appear, and that will make us feel very bad; guilty.
So to defend ourselves from that discomfort, we have a resource.
We turned up the volume on all those things from the story that we expected to hear: the revolver in the glove compartment, the locked doors, the isolation of the place.
And we turn down the volume on all those things that we didn&#39;t expect to hear and that we don&#39;t want to hear: for example when she tells him that she liked him too, or when she tells us that she spoke to him as if she were the older sister, or that she asked him to take her home.
What is the use of doing this?
To believe her, to be able to trust that she really was a victim.
I call this victimization of victims.
Victimization because in order to believe that they are innocent and that they are a victim, we need to think of them as helpless, paralyzed, mute.
But there is another way to get rid of discomfort, and it is exactly the opposite: we turn up the volume on things we did not expect to hear, such as: &quot;I spoke well to him&quot;, &quot;I asked him to take me home&quot;, &quot; I asked him to finish quickly&quot;, and we lowered it to the things that we did expect to hear, the revolver in the glove compartment, the isolation.
What is this for?
It serves so that we can hold on to doubts, and feel more comfortable with doubts.
Then new questions appear, for example: Who sends her to go to those clubs?
Did you see how she and her friends dress, the minis, the necklines?
What are you waiting for?
Questions that are certainly not questions, are rather judgments and judgments that end in a sentence: She asked for it.
The sentence would be corroborated by the fact that she later does not say that she had fought to avoid the rape.
So it means that he did not resist, it means that he consented.
If he sought it out and consented, what violation are you talking about?
I call this victim blaming.
Both the arguments that serve to blame and to victimize, we all have them, all in our heads, very close at hand, including victims and perpetrators.
So much so that when Ana came to me, she told me that she didn&#39;t know if her testimony was going to help me, because she wasn&#39;t sure that what had happened to her had been rape.
Ana, like most of us, also believed that a rape is more like an armed robbery, a violent process that lasts 4 or 5 minutes, and not like a nice young man&#39;s gossip that lasts all night and that ends in a kidnapping.
When she felt afraid that they would kill her, she felt afraid that they would leave marks, and she had to give up her body to avoid it, then she knew that the rape was something else.
Ana had never discussed this with anyone.
He could have gone to the family, but he didn&#39;t.
He didn&#39;t do it because he was afraid.
She was afraid that the same thing that happens to all of us would happen to the person she had chosen to tell her about, and that is that doubts and suspicions arise, those questions, every time a topic like this is discussed.
And if that had happened, it would have been perhaps worse than the rape itself.
She could have spoken with a friend, with a sister, very hardly with a partner: the slightest hint of doubt on her face or in her voice would have been devastating for her, and probably the end of the relationship.
Ana remains silent because she knows intimately that no one, not all of us, not her family, not even the therapists, much less the police or the magistrates, are willing to listen to what Ana did at that moment.
First and foremost, Ana said &quot;no.&quot;
When he saw that his was not useless, he spoke to him well, tried not to exacerbate his violence, not to give him ideas.
She spoke to him as if everything that was happening at that moment was normal, so as not to arouse in him the fear that she might report him later.
Now, I ask myself and I ask you: isn&#39;t all that she did resisting?
No, it is not for all or almost all of us, probably, because it is not for the law.
In most countries, the codes continue to require that the victim, to prove her innocence, I mean well, the victim to prove her innocence, present marks on her body that attest that she had a &quot;stubborn and constant&quot; fight with her aggressor .
I can assure you that in most court cases, there are no marks that reach.
I listened to many women.
And I have not heard any of them speak of themselves as having been reduced to one thing, totally submitted to the will of the other.
Rather, I listened to them as surprised and even a little proud to recognize how lucid they had been at that moment, how attentive to every detail, as if that allowed them to have some control over what was happening.
So I thought: &quot;Of course, what women do in these situations is negotiate.&quot;
They trade sex for life.
They ask the aggressor to finish quickly, so that everything ends as soon as possible and with the least cost.
They submit to penetration, because although they may not believe it, penetration is what keeps them the furthest from a sexual or affective scene.
They submit to penetration, because penetration hurts less than kisses, caresses, soft words.
Now, if we are to continue to expect rapes to be what they very rarely are: a rapist who is a low-class depraved, and not a young university student or a businessman who goes out on a Friday or Saturday; if we&#39;re going to continue to expect the victims to be modest, demure women who faint at the scene, rather than self-assured women, we&#39;re going to continue to be unable to listen.
Women will continue to be unable to speak, and we will all continue to be responsible for that silence and their loneliness.
(Applause)
You can imagine it: you are in a bar and, you know, or in a disco, all that, and you start talking to a girl, and after a while, well, she comes up in the conversation &quot;and what do you do?&quot;
And since you think your job is interesting, you tell him &quot;I&#39;m a mathematician.&quot;
(Laughter) 33.51% of the girls (Laughter) at that moment simulate an urgent phone call and leave.
(laughs) 64.69% of girls desperately try to change the subject and leave.
(Laughter) There is a 0.8% that is your cousin, your girlfriend and your mother, (Laughter) who know that you work in something strange but they did not remember what (Laughter) and there is a 1% that follows the conversation.
When that conversation continues, one of these 2 sentences invariably appears at some point: A) &quot;I was horrible at math, but it wasn&#39;t my fault, the teacher was horrible.&quot;
(Laughter) YB) &quot;But what is this math thing for?&quot;
(laughs) I&#39;ll deal with case B.
(Laughter) When someone asks you what mathematics is for, they are not asking you about applications of mathematical sciences.
He is asking you: &quot;And why did I have to study that shit that I never used again?&quot;
(Laughter) That&#39;s what he&#39;s really asking you.
Given this, when a mathematician is asked what mathematics is for, mathematicians divide into groups.
54.51% of mathematicians take an attacking stance, and 44.77% of mathematicians take a defensive stance.
There is a 0.8%, rare, among which I include myself.
What are the attackers?
Those of the attack are mathematicians who tell you that this question does not make sense, because mathematics has its own meaning in itself, it is a beautiful building that has its own logic that is built and that one does not have to always be looking at the possible Applications.
What is poetry for?
What good is love?
What is life itself for?
What question is that?
(Laughter) Hardy, for example, is an exponent of this attack.
And those who are defensive tell you that even if you don&#39;t realize it, honey, the math is behind everything.
(Laughter) They always name, always, name the bridges and the computers.
If you don&#39;t know math, the bridge falls.
(Laughter) Really computers are all math.
Now these have also taken to telling you that behind computer security and credit cards are prime numbers.
These are the answers your math teacher will give you if you ask.
It is one of the defensive.
Ok, but who is right?
Those who say that mathematics does not have to be useful for anything, or those who say that it really is behind everything?
You&#39;re both really right.
But I have told you that I was one of that rare 0.8% who says otherwise, right?
So, okay, ask me what math is for.
(Audience asks) Okay!
76.34% of people have asked, there is 23.41% who have kept quiet, and 0.8% who do not know what they are doing.
Well, dear 76.31%, it is true that mathematics does not have to be useful for anything, it is true that it is a beautiful building, a logical building, probably one of the greatest collective efforts that human beings have made throughout the history.
But it is also true that wherever scientists, where technicians, are looking for mathematical theories, models that allow them to advance, there they are, in the building of mathematics, which permeates everything.
It is true that we have to go a little deeper, we are going to see what is behind the science.
Science works by intuition, by creativity, and mathematics tames intuition and tames creativity.
Almost everyone who hasn&#39;t heard it before is surprised that if you took a 0.1mm thick sheet of paper, the kind we normally use, big enough, and you could fold it 50 times, the thickness of that pile would occupy the distance from the Earth to the Sun.
Your intuition tells you: &quot;That is impossible.&quot;
Throw the accounts and you will see that yes.
That&#39;s what math is for.
It is true that science, all science, only makes sense because it makes us better understand this beautiful world in which we find ourselves.
And because it makes us, it helps us to avoid the traps of this painful world in which we find ourselves.
There are sciences that touch that application with their hand.
Oncological science, for example.
And there are others that we look at from afar, with envy at times, but knowing that we are their support.
All the basic sciences are the support of those, and among them mathematics.
All that makes science science is the rigor of mathematics.
And that rigor comes to them because its results are eternal.
Surely they have said, or have ever been told, that a diamond is forever, right?
It depends on what one understands forever!
A theorem, that really is forever!
(Laughter) The Pythagorean theorem, that&#39;s true even though Pythagoras has died, I&#39;m telling you.
(Laughter) Even if the world collapses, the Pythagorean theorem would still be true.
Wherever a couple of legs and a good hypotenuse come together (Laughter), the Pythagorean theorem works to the max, to the max.
(Applause) Well, we mathematicians make theorems.
eternal truths.
But it is not always so easy to know what is an eternal truth, a theorem, and what is a mere conjecture.
A demo is needed.
For example: imagine that I have a large, enormous, infinite field here.
I want to cover it with equal pieces, leaving no gaps.
I could use squares, right?
I could use triangles.
Not circles, they leave little holes.
What is the best piece that I can use?
The one that to cover the same surface has a smaller border.
Pappus of Alexandria, in the year 300 said that it was best to use hexagons, as bees do.
But he didn&#39;t show it!
The guy said &quot;hexagons, uh, I want it, come on, hexagons, give it to me!&quot;
He didn&#39;t show it, he stayed at a guess, he said &quot;Hexagons!&quot;
The world, as you know, was divided between pappists and anti-pappists, until 1700 years later, 1700 years later, in 1999 Thomas Hales proved that Pappus and the bees were right, that it is best to use hexagons.
And that became a theorem, the honeycomb theorem, that is going to be true forever, ever after, more than any diamond you have.
(Laughter) But what if we go to 3 dimensions?
If I want to fill the space, with equal pieces, leaving no gaps, I can use cubes, right?
Not spheres, which leave little holes.
(laughs) What&#39;s the best piece to wear?
Lord Kelvin, the one with Kelvin degrees and all that, he said that it was best to use a truncated octahedron (Laughter) which, as you all know (Laughter), is this right here!
(Applause) Come on!
Who does not have a truncated octahedron at home?
(Laughter) Even if it&#39;s plastic.
Baby, bring the truncated octahedron, visitors are coming.
Everyone has!
(Laughter) But Kelvin didn&#39;t show it.
It stuck to a guess, the Kelvin conjecture.
The world, as you know, was divided between Kelvinists and anti-Kelvinists (Laughter) until a hundred-odd years later, a hundred-odd years later, someone found a better structure.
Weaire and Phelan, Weaire and Phelan found this little thing right here, (Laughter) this structure that they gave the fancy name of the Weaire and Phelan structure.
(Laughter) It seems like a weird thing but it&#39;s not that weird, it&#39;s also present in nature.
It is very very curious that this structure, due to its geometric properties, was used to build the swimming building at the Beijing Olympics.
There Michael Phelps won 8 gold medals, he became the best swimmer of all time.
Well, of all times until a better one comes out, right?
As it happens to the structure of Weaire and Phelan, it is the best until a better one comes out.
But be careful, because this one does have the opportunity, that even if a hundred and some years pass, even if it&#39;s 1700 years from now, someone shows that this is the best piece possible.
And then it will be a theorem, a truth forever, ever after.
More than any diamond.
So, well, if you want to tell someone that you love them forever (Laughter), you can give them a diamond, but if you want to tell them that you love them forever, always, give them a theorem!
(Laughter) Of course, still, you will have to prove it, that your love does not remain a conjecture.
(Applause) Thank you.
We are each in a way in this life.
Some of us are more extroverted, others more introverted and others, neither one thing nor the other.
I, I have to say, am very introverted.
I&#39;m not good at social relationships.
Imagine how difficult it is for me to put myself in this red dot in front of so many people.
It&#39;s much more interesting for me to hang out in a quiet place on a Saturday with a friend or two, than to get into the hustle and bustle of a crowded disco.
And I won&#39;t tell you more, to stay at home, calm, in the warmth, watching a movie.
Oh the movies!
There is nothing in this world that I like more.
Cinema has been my greatest passion in the last 5 or 6 years.
In this time, I have developed a taste for cinema that goes beyond the meaning of the word &quot;entertainment&quot;.
And why the cinema?
What is it about cinema that makes me like it so much?
To tell you the truth, until recently I had not asked myself that question.
I have already said that I am not good at interacting with people, but I am very good at observing.
I love to observe.
I really enjoy watching people talk, interact with each other, walk around, without being a gossip.
Don&#39;t think bad.
But that&#39;s why I think I like movies so much.
In the cinema, in the movies, you do not enter, you simply deign to observe them from the outside.
Cinema gives you a broad, total vision of the world, of all its people, of all its ideas, of all its ways of seeing reality.
And I think that&#39;s why I like movies so much.
In all this time, I have seen thousands of those visions and I think I have a much more global idea of the world than if I had never watched, or seen movies.
I think that this is the great advantage of being behind, of not interacting.
And what kind of cinema do I like?
I admit it, it is not that it is the most typical cinema for people my age.
It is auteur cinema, independent, low-budget cinema, of social denunciation, far from the archetypes of US cinema, cinema from countries as cinematically rare as Turkey, Palestine or the Philippines.
Well, my mother says that I am very strange, but it is the type of cinema that I like the most, the one that I enjoy the most, with its characters and stories.
They touch your heart.
You feel things with them, you suffer with them, you cry with them, you laugh with them.
As one of my favorite directors, Lars von Trier, says: &quot;Movies are like stones in your shoes, they have to hurt.&quot;
It&#39;s not that we have to suffer with each and every movie, but we have to feel true emotions.
However, when I see movies from the US, full of special effects, empty characters, stories that don&#39;t add anything, it&#39;s just a story, nothing more.
It doesn&#39;t come to you, you don&#39;t feel, you don&#39;t suffer, you don&#39;t cry.
That, to me, is useless.
I, being an introvert, took my love of cinema as something of my own, something personal.
Everyone knew that he was a great movie buff but he had practically no one with whom to discuss the movies he saw.
All this changed one day when, ironically, I left the cinema and received a private message from Twitter: &quot;Hello, we are looking for a boy or girl in Valladolid to cover this edition of Seminci.
Would you sign up?&quot;
And what was I going to say 7 days away from the best auteur cinema in Europe and on top of that for free?
Well: &quot;Of course.
Count on me&quot;.
And here you had me, 15 years old and with a journalist&#39;s accreditation around my neck.
That week I was watching movies, movies and movies.
I got a bit into the journalistic world, but what I got out of there was much more than that.
I finally found the way to channel my feelings towards the cinema, to express myself, to open my inner world to others.
Every day I had to write a chronicle with the movies I saw, what I liked about them, what I didn&#39;t like.
And I don&#39;t know if it may seem easy or difficult, but it is very complicated, because a film has many elements: the script, the direction, the actors, the music, the sound.
And what is good about each of them?
Do they make the movie good or bad?
At first, this was very complicated.
I always forgot things in the chronicle.
But in the end, with practice, I almost get fluent.
When the 58th edition of Seminci ended, I began to collaborate regularly with the website that had accredited me, called Esencia Cine.
In this time, almost a year, my ability to write, to express myself, and my enormous love for cinema have been increasing and increasing by leaps and bounds.
That was last year.
What has happened this year?
That I hung up my accreditation again and got down to work again in the 59th edition of Seminci.
I assure you that this year I learned a lot more because I saw more films, practically 20 in 7 days, I went to many more press conferences and I had a meeting with Imanol Arias.
The result was a week of movies, movies and more movies, in which I learned a lot.
And I assure you that this will always remain, even if I didn&#39;t study, even if I practically didn&#39;t eat, even if I didn&#39;t sleep, I learned and it will stay with me forever.
Many people, when I tell them that I write for a web page, that I write for Seminci, almost all of them tell me: &quot;Do they pay you?&quot;
Well...
Well no.
Why are they going to pay me?
Why are they going to pay me when I do what I really like, what I really feel and, on top of that, it helps me to open myself up to others?
At my age, I wouldn&#39;t find anyone paying me to do this.
I don&#39;t have the career, I don&#39;t have anything.
But really, in this life, if you want to do something, do it.
If they pay you, great.
If not, you will be happy with your work, which I think is the most important thing.
No?
(Applause) Cinema has opened many more doors for me than I thought.
Thanks to the fact that I write about cinema, I am able to open up, I am able to really be myself.
When I write, I break the barrier that I have of oral expression, which is so difficult for me.
I manage to be really me, to capture my ideas as I feel them.
But far from all this, which is very useful to me and of which I am proud, I think that what I like the most, what I enjoy the most with my work, is when I write something, a piece of news, criticism or report, I post it and receive it. messages from classmates, friends, family, teachers who say: &quot;Congratulations.
You write great.
I love it&quot;.
You know that when you do that, your work, apart from being good for you, is good for others because they enjoy and learn from what you do.
And when they tell you that you know it&#39;s great.
(Applause) And here you see me, a quiet, shy, introverted boy who, at the age of 15 and without any faith in himself, managed to do the same job as some journalists with his work, his qualifications, his salary, and his best communication skills. public expression.
I wouldn&#39;t trade the way I&#39;ve found to open up for anything.
I am me when I write, it is me.
And I&#39;m going to tell you something, don&#39;t trust what you see of me every day, what you see in photos and videos.
Don&#39;t trust
Trust what I write, because that&#39;s me, really me.
Without any cover, without any barrier.
But, far from all this, that &quot;Congratulations.
You write great.
I love what you do,&quot; is the best they can tell me.
It is the most beautiful thing that can be said to me in life, being an introvert.
Thank you so much.
(Applause)
