In 911 Call, Professor Admits to Shooting Girlfriend
In a 911 call, his voice only slightly shaky, college professor Shannon Lamb told police he had shot his girlfriend and officers needed to get over to their house.
Lamb made a point to say his "sweet dog" was there alive and probably upset, and said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on her phone.
Inside the home, officers found Amy Prentiss' body and a hand-written note scribbled on a white legal pad: "I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me," read the letter authorities say was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school's campus, where police believe he shot and killed a well-liked history professor, Ethan Schmidt, in the doorway to his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fateful 911 call sometime after that.
By the end of the day, there would be one more death: Lamb took his own life as police closed in on him.
A day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lamb.
The details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
Students said they looked forward to his class.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the "wonderful people" he shared his academic life with.
Both taught in the Division of Social Sciences and History, which lists 17 faculty members, and many students took courses from both.
At the same time, there were some inclinations of problems.
A student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and jittery, "like there was something wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence, saying he had a health issue of some sort.
This year, he was only teaching two online classes.
Recent changes in the university's hiring policies meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic tenure track to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but "obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind."
Those are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing the campus, police later picked up Lamb's trail when he crossed back into Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be apprehended, Lamb killed himself with a single .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parents' home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to that home, though Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and education classes.
He received a doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as smart, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar.
He was quite the heartthrob back then.
All the girls would melt when he was around," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
In the 911 call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no record of them ever marrying.
They had a dog named Lightning that lived with them at the brick house that backs up to a bayou in Gautier.
Police said the dog was OK.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who's now 19.
"She was completely devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb but heard through his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago.
Later, they played together in the occasional gig.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss the night of Sept. 5, after Lamb had finished playing his guitar and harmonica for a sparse crowd.
There was no sign of anything amiss.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cutting up and throwing one-liners at each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of wit about them.
Schmidt, the slain professor, directed the first-year seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student government.
On the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, staff, students, and members of the community, attended a candlelight memorial.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Classes resume Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students to come back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying Lamb made the 911 call after shooting Schmidt, and that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife in the 911 call, there is no indication the two ever married.
Toys R Us Plans to Hire Fewer Holiday Season Workers
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many holiday season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people to work at stores and distribution centers around the country, down from the 45,000 hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will start interviewing applicants this month, with staff levels rising from October through December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, holiday shopping season is drawing closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to help them staff stores and sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox Jokes About His 'Date' With Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge moment for Michael J. Fox professionally.
It was noteworthy because of personal reasons, too.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royals to come in and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and it dawns on me that Princess Diana is going to be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary, "Back in Time."
The movie starts and it occurs to me that I'm a fake yawn and an arm stretch away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time," a documentary about "Back to the Future," features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson, and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis, and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It really is for me," said Spielberg, "inarguably the greatest time travel movie ever put on film."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in select movie theaters Oct.
UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's stepped up military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and misery for millions of people.
The U.N. chief again urged all parties, including the divided U.N. Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session later this month to discuss Syria.
He expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation unsolvable."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis.
8 Poll Numbers That Show Donald Trump Is For Real
Some have tried to label him a flip-flopper.
Others have dismissed him as a joke.
And some are holding out for an implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans are trying to drag Donald Trump down from atop the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump's lead at double digits, and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mogul's nomination chances.
Of course, it's still early in the election cycle.
None of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Pundits point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's lead was giving way to a rising Herman Cain, neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recognizing Trump's staying power and beginning to unload their dollars to topple him.
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul isn't just a passing phase:
Trump's favorability ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Right before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
Roughly three in 10 say they have a negative view.
And these numbers hold up in early states.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there had a favorable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the nominee.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were the nominee.
Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the nominee.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same of Trump).
The next closest in enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the flip side, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes the nominee.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bombast and insults, 52 percent of leaned Republican voters nationwide think that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll.
The same number holds in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to be commander in chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to serve effectively, and almost six in 10 independents say his temperament does not belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their pundit hats, Republican voters think Trump is for real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump was the best bet, according to a CNN/ORC poll out last week.
That's a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Jeb Bush in late July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters haven't had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this time last cycle, four in 10 Republicans picked Rick Perry to win the nomination, vs. only 28 percent for eventual nominee Mitt Romney.
Still, it shows that a plurality of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some pundits point out that the splintered field is likely contributing to Trump's lead, while anti-Trump support is be spread diffusely among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that, in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always garners majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and, finally, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead heat with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head.
A bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Trump say they have locked in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say they would never change their mind.
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to switching candidates.
Still, Trump's strongest competition at the moment is from fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for Trump.
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign announcement speech two months ago, immigration has been front and center in the 2016 conversation.
Some are worried that Trump's bombast will drive crucial Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding efforts.
But according to Monday's new ABC/Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, it seems Donald Trump will remain too.
Frustration with government is climbing to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for roughly half of the support from Republican voters, largely due to their outsider status.
Six in 10 Republicans in Monday's new ABC/Post poll say they want a political outsider over someone with government experience.
And they are angry at Washington, too.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa from two weeks ago shows that three in four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "mad as hell."
MPs support greater state share in coal fees
Czech Republic to gain more than 400 million crowns
The Chamber of Deputies has supported the government's amendment to the Mining Act, which adjusts the yield from fees from the open-cast mining of brown coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that this will mean that both the state treasury and municipalities will receive more money.
The proposal was criticised by opposition MPs, who are afraid that that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, as they would have to pay higher fees directly into state coffers.The Chamber of Deputies has supported the government's amendment to the Mining Act, which adjusts the yield from fees from the open-cast mining of brown coal from mining companies.
The state's share shall increase to 67 percent, whole municipalities' share shall be reduced from the current 75 percent to 33 percent.
The proposal also alters the method for the calculation of payments for minerals mined by companies.
A change in fees for the mining of minerals is to bring 427 million crowns more into state coffers than was the case in 2013.
According to the government, the measure will have a neutral effect on the income of municipalities as fees will be higher.
In the year before last, municipalities gained approx. 450 million crowns and the state treasury 150 million crowns.
Municipalities gained around 200 million crowns and the state 66 million crowns from lignite mining.
The amendment also anticipates the increase in payments from extraction areas with mining permits to one thousand crowns per hectare per year.
The entirety of income generated from these payment shall remain with the municipalities.
Minister for Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that, thanks to this, municipalities will receive 100 million crowns per year, as opposed to the previous figure of 14 million crowns.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but stipulated by the government through decrees.
Payments will be calculated as the product of the quantity of minerals mined and rates for individual types of mineral.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among others, the option of reacting flexibly to the current economic situation.
However, MP Marek Benda (ODS) warned that the setting of fees by government decree may not be in accordance with the constitution.
Minister Mládek responded saying that this would not be a tax, as in this case the government is making minerals - which are state property - subject to a fee.
Fees are received by the municipalities whose territory is affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the money is received by municipalities and one quarter by the state.
The same proportions shall apply to the extraction of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money collected by the state from fees shall be tied to a single purpose.
For example, 28 percent must be directed towards the remedying of damage following mining or the funding of the mine rescue service.
The proposal was today criticised by opposition MPs, who chiefly claimed that it would harm both municipalities and regional governments.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 a Starostové) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, as they would have to pay higher fees directly into state coffers.
"You can't asset-strip some of the poorest regions just so that the Finance Minister can improve his budget," said David Kádner (Úsvit), whose constituency is in the Ústí nad Labem Region
Communist MP Hana Aulická also warned of increased unemployment in the Most area.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed the rejection of the amendment, and Kučera wanted to return it to the government for revision.
The explanatory report states that, according to extraction companies, increases in fees would not be transmitted to coal prices as more than 90 percent of these are agreed on a long-term basis.
The chief consumers, power stations, would not, therefore, feel an increase in prices.
"On the other hand, though, this fact increases the risk that extraction organisations will compensate for increased payments with efforts to reduce their operating costs, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," admits the government.
However, it also stated that a fee increase would be bearable in terms of employment.
According to Milan Urban (ČSSD), who tabled the amendment, a key issue is for MPs to know the conclusions reached regarding the updated energy concept and, chiefly, the government's decision on coal extraction limits before passing the law.
He emphasised that, were coal to be mined beyond the limits, it would have an impact on yields for both the state and municipalities.
Urban does not agree with Mládek on the fact that the decision on the breaking of the limit at the Československé armády mine should only be taken after 2020.
He said that limits at the Československé armády mine should be broken due to social reasons, the national economy and the Czech energy sector.
Veselý to lead the Czechs as number one, seeding will be affected by the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear on the table at Thursday's draw for the Davis Cup play-off in India, and this time all of them will probably play.
Due to the difficult weather conditions, captain Jaroslav Navrátil is planning to spread the burden across all four players.
The weather in Delhi is hot, with high humidity, and it is expected that the matches, which could stretch to five sets, will be demanding.
We must take that into account.
I'd like to spread it out according to the weather
and according to how it's going, said Navrátil at the Czech team's training session today at the Raja Kumar Khanna Centre.
Team number one and world number forty Jiří Veselý is expected to take part in both the Friday and Sunday singles.
Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek will probably take it in turns as the team number two.
I would like almost all of them to be involved.
I have an idea in my head, but I won't talk about it now, said the captain.
Another certainty in the Czech line-up should be Štěpánek's participation in the Saturday doubles.
The only question is who will line up alongside the experienced doubles player, who has an 18:4 record in doubles in the Davis Cup.
It probably won't be Veselý.
The remaining options are with Rosol or Adam Pavlásek.
I really don't know who he'll play with and what it'll look like," said Navrátil.
He said that he would decide according to how the singles develop.
One option could be Pavlásek, who provided for a surprise win in the 1st round against the Australians.
"He's decent in doubles," said Navrátil.
It worked for me against Australia, and if I play, I'd like to give the same performance that I did there from the second set onwards.
"I'm glad for the experience and I'd like to score a point," said Pavlásek.
The home team will put Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP rankings), who won the Challenger tournament in Shanghaj last week, where he beat players ranked in the 300s and 400s, into the singles.
The number two will be Somdev Devvarman (164th).
Both players are on the Challenger tour and ours have ATP experience, but we've seen many times that rankings don't play a decisive role in the Davis Cup.
"What decides are momentary form and the weather," said Navrátil.
Friday's opening singles rubbers start at 06:30 CEST and may last longer due to the weather.
Forecasts say that it will rain and the court is not covered.
However, it will be possible to play under floodlights.
They've sorted it out now and the lights have about two thousand lux, which is plenty.
"It should be possible to play it to a finish under lights," said Navrátil.
Jeremy Corbyn to make debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been keenly awaited
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, taking on David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six allotted questions shortly after midday, with his performance likely to be closely scrutinised by the media and Labour MPs.
He has called for "less theatre and more facts" at the weekly showpiece.
He has also said he could skip some sessions, leaving them to colleagues.
The encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, coming after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech to the TUC annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and did recognise the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "irrespective" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, citing differences over the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences are also "stacking up" within Labour following Mr Corbyn's appointment over its position on the European Union and the government's cap on benefits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether.
Hours later Mr Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said the party was "very clear" that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron has faced across the despatch box over the past decade since he became Tory leader.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has "crowd sourced" ideas for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said PMQs is too confrontational and that he will refrain from both "repartee" and trading barbs, instead vowing to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will deputise for him at PMQs when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He has also floated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion, saying he had approached the Commons Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics often associated with PMQs but admitted some years later that he had failed.
Since it was first televised in 1990, PMQs has been seen as a key barometer of a leader's judgement, their command of the Commons and their standing among their fellow MPs although critics have argued it has become a caricature and is in need of far-reaching reforms.
'Shot in Joburg': Homeless youth trained as photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a tough place to be homeless.
But one group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and make a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youngsters how to take photographs of their neighbourhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News went to meet one of the project's first graduates.

Pound rises as UK wage growth accelerates
The pound jumped following data showing a pick-up in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was led higher by bid target SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK earnings excluding bonuses grew 2.9% compared with the same period last year.
The rate was the fastest since 2009, and was seen as bringing forward estimates of when rates might rise.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was up 0.84% against the euro at €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed up 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the stand-out stock on the market, jumping 20% after it received a bid approach from rival AB InBev.
A deal would combine the world's two largest brewers, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher following encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - had begun to grow again.
Shares in Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5bn through a share placement as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
Shares in packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest fallers on the index, down 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the firm to "sell."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sportswear firm reported an 83% jump in half-year pre-tax profits to £46.6m.
JD Sports boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports Executive Chairman Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But that spending power is unlikely to outweigh the higher labour costs at his firm, he says.
The costs could hit JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer extra jobs.
Opponents of 'marshmallow' flats celebrate.
Controversial building halted.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the ruling to be unlawful and will appeal.
Hundreds of people protested against the building, which was to be built in the close vicinity of the Convent of St. Agnes , in front of the Prague 1 Municipal Authority. A petition was also submitted.
In its ruling the municipal authority stated that there was a breach of the Building Act, as not all mandatory aspects of the planning decision were observed.
According to the ruling, "The planning decision in question does not contain several mandatory requirements, for example type of land, distance from neighbouring buildings, sufficiently clear, comprehensible description of the shape of the building and delineation of the area affected by construction."
The municipal authority also considers the fact that some documents submitted for the decision were issued for the documentation originally discussed, which, however, changed, to be unlawful.
These include, for example, the opinion of environmental bodies.
Part of the building was to be built on land belonging to the National Gallery, whose permission the investor had not, however, obtained.
It follows from official material submitted that the owner of the land only gave its consent to the project material for the planning process, and not to the location of the building on its land, wrote the construction office.
According to Francesco Augusto Razetto from the investment company, the construction office did not take into account a ruling by its superior body, the Ministry for Regional Development, according to which the deadline for the start of a survey had already expired.
It was, in any case, a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, we observe all laws of the Czech Republic and respect all authorities and institutions concerned," said Razetto in a press release.
The project, nicknamed the marshmallow due to the facade colour allegedly proposed, has provoked strong emotions in Prague.
Previously, hundreds of people had gathered to protest against the building.
Associations and inhabitants of nearby houses objected to the fact that some permits had been issued years ago for a building that looked different.
They also criticised the unsuitability of the building for the historic centre of Prague and the immediate vicinity of the Convent of St. Agnes.
The building was designed by Zdeněk Fránek, who changed the project several times.
The original form of the project from 2008, which included a glass facade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture based on the opinion of the National Heritage Institute (NHI), which also cancelled a permit issued by the Prague Heritage Association.
However, the NHI and the heritage department at the municipal authority approved a new project by Praga Progetti e Investimenti featuring windows in the shape of faces, and it was on this basis that planning permission was issued.
The architect rejected complaints made by opponents, saying that he had never considered a pink facade, which gave the project its nickname after the pink and white confectionary.
Czech politician gives migrants a lift
Hungarians put them all in prison.
Berg went to Hungary to give refugees humanitarian aid.
On the way he and his companions picked up three Syrian refugees, whom he allegedly wanted to give a lift for half a kilometre.
At the time it wasn't yet a criminal offence, he claimed to Lidové noviny.
We knew that the police wouldn't prosecute us for this.
But when they stopped us, we were surprised when they arrested us and remanded us in custody in Szeged, he said.
The politician eventually spent nine hours in a cell.
He says that the police behaved properly, but there were communication problems because their English wasn't very good.
However, he says that the prison was miserable.
For example, 15 Syrian refugees were crammed in a cell measuring about three by four metres.
These included a two year-old boy and a four year-old girl.
They had already been in the cell for a day and due to the language barrier didn't know what was going to happen to them, said Berg.

Metcash launches grassroots campaign to fight Aldi incursion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from an Aldi onslaught in South Australia and Western Australia.
Grocery wholesaler Metcash has kicked off a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first of as many as 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo's offering taste testing at IGA stores and store owners selling discounted South Australian football league tickets to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on September 29, when the food, liquor and hardware wholesaler hosts its annual investor strategy day.
There is much at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Metcash's IGA store footprint and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
South Australian and Western Australian shoppers are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers enjoy a much stronger market share than they do in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared with around 14 per cent in the Eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will snare around 5 per cent of the grocery market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales from all existing players but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million a year in sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, generating sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss of food and grocery sales and volumes on Metcash's high fixed-cost base could cost Metcash around $13 million in earnings before interest and tax, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, even though a recent Roy Morgan survey found IGA shoppers were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash's food and grocery sales will fall 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "highly, probably disappear within a decade.
Metcash has declined to respond publicly to Mr Douglass' comments.
But it is understood that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and earnings from Metcash's food and grocery business, which supplies about 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting operating deleverage as sales and margins come under pressure.
However, the wholesaler is fighting back, investing more than $150 million a year matching shelf prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers refurbish stores by adding faster-growing fresh food, and rolling out a better range of private label groceries.
Metcash chief executive Ian Morrice says the price matching and store refurbishment programs are gaining traction and is hoping the wholesaler will return to underlying profit growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves kudos rather than criticism for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been the collateral damage in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves kudos rather than criticism for his own behaviour, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo regularly referred to as the "Special Ks," was dragged into an unwelcome spotlight by the infamous Kyrgios sledge of Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice had to be separated by the chair umpire, with Harrison declaring: "Wawrinka should've decked Kyrgios, and I should deck that kid."
While he was last seen smashing a racquet after cramp foiled a potential US Open upset of Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis has been defended staunchly by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the second singles berth behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"One thing I do feel quite keenly about is I think Thanasi's been dragged into the fray a little bit," Healy said.
He did break a racquet when he lost when he cramped in the US, but he's not the first player to break a racquet out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn't be proud of that.
But, really, he's handled himself extremely well, in pretty provocative circumstances in the US with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's a great team around him, he's got a great family around him and I just think he's been a little hard done by.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits in with the team and so on, he hasn't ever had an issue with the other players, he's well respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he's in great shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also backed the decision to overlook Kyrgios for the important tie, starting on Friday, describing the "mutual decision" as the right thing for all, but backing the Canberran to return as a long-term fixture in the team.
"First of all we want the team to be completely focused on the tie and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick, he's risen very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, he's growing up in the public eye and he's made some terrible errors and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the limelight where he can just reflect on that I think is appropriate and it's best for the team and it's best for him.
Europe migrant crisis: Hungary declares emergency, seals border, detains migrants
Declaring a state of emergency, Hungary sealed off its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those trying to enter illegally, aiming to shut down the flow of migrants pouring in.
Chaos ensued at the border, as hundreds of migrants piled up in a no man's land, and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
Stuck for an unknown amount of time on a strip of road between the two countries' checkpoints, those fleeing violence in their homelands pitched tents and settled in.
But frustrations were on the rise.
As a police helicopter hovered above, migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister declared it was "unacceptable" that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more were arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.
There will have to be talks in the coming days with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turmoil at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to come up with a united immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
The ministers did agree to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overwhelmed Italy and Greece and spoke hopefully of reaching an eventual deal - next month or by the end of the year - on which EU nations would take 120,000 more refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called Tuesday for a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, was not pinning its hopes on any action soon from Brussels or its neighbors.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum court cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a razor-wire fence along part of its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has finished a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were enlisted in the race to finish the razor wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In the last few months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for migrants, many of them war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, has insisted that most arriving are economic migrants seeking a better life, not war refugees entitled to protection - a view sharply at odds with other EU nations, including Germany.
The new laws that took effect at midnight in Hungary now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-meter (13-foot) razor-wire fence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia and also includes longer prison terms for convicted human traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of crisis," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear on this: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, parliament must still approve the deployment of the military, expected next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, homeland security adviser to Orban, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross at the border and 15 deeper in the country.
They got across by damaging the fence, are now in police custody and are being charged with committing offenses under the new laws.
Authorities are quickly repairing the fence.
Hungarian officials also closed two of seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after deploying a train car covered with razor wire to close one of them.
Chaos enveloped the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, as the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container to process people and crowds pressed to squeeze inside.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary, saying they were refusing food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders cut by half in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is gaining on her.
Clinton now has the backing of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders comes in second, with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he is running for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the primary contests, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their minds are made up about which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's backers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News Poll, Clinton has lost ground among a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moderates, but those leads have narrowed.
Her support among men has dropped considerably and Sanders only trails her by 5 points.
Clinton's advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now even.
However, Clinton still has a large lead with older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by double-digits among liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point edge with this group.
About half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party's nominee.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only back her because she is the nominee.
Six percent would not support her.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her.
Views are more mixed among those not currently backing Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically back Clinton, fewer Republican voters say that about their frontrunner, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open-ended question why they want her to be the nominee, the top answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by it's time for a woman president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Also mentioned by Clinton supporters is her association with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Agreement on the issues, and electability are also cited.
As the vice president weighs a potential run for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him jump in the race - although a third don't think he should.
When Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party's nomination, Biden is the top pick.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say Biden would be their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders widens, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the running.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however that figure is down from 78 percent last month.
Biden is a distant second on this measure, but the percentage that sees him as the most electable has risen.
Still, when asked which is more important in a nominee, Democratic voters pick issues over electability.
Similar to last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nominee to these primary voters.
The Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, perform well on some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Majorities see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and as having strong leadership qualities.
Biden does the best of the three on honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have an opinion of him on this.
Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as in line with their views ideologically.
On all of these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of Sanders.
As questions continue about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server while Secretary of State, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it hasn't impacted their overall views of her.
But it's a different story among the American public overall.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while just about a third are satisfied.
The public's views on this were split back in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans say the email controversy has had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has grown worse.
It is mainly Republicans, more than six in 10, who say their views of Clinton have become worse.
Even though Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by her party's voters, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month, and 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think of her as honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters nationwide don't see Trump as honest and trustworthy either.
Both Clinton and Trump, however, get good marks on leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush do the best on honesty.
More see Sanders as honest than not, but like Carson, many don't have an opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson draws close behind Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson is running close behind Donald Trump in the newest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates account for half the support of voters in the new poll, leaving others scrounging for a foothold
Republican voters nationwide continue to back Trump in large numbers, climbing from 23% support in the last CBS poll, conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% in the poll out Tuesday.
But Carson rocketed in that same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found Carson doing well across demographic groups, edging out Trump among college-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, has slipped behind with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker falling farthest from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio all tied for third place with 6%.
The margin of error for the 376-person sample of Republican voters in this newest poll is plus-or-minus 6%, and was conducted Sept.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, released last week, showed Carson rising in the polls -- landing at 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump's 32% support.
The latest poll from ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump significantly ahead of Carson.
Facing a rising Carson last week, Trump took some potshots at the retired neurosurgeon, even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign stop in Iowa.
Five fraternity members charged in death of Baruch College freshman
Nearly two years after a college student died during a fraternity hazing ritual in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, murder charges have been filed against five people.
Members of New York City's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation rite in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
Officials said he was blindfolded, saddled with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly tackled while he tried to walk toward a target across a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that his head hurt then fell unconscious.
Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call 911 after Deng passed out, and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital, police say.
They did, however, find time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity's national president to seek advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, members began to hide paraphernalia and basically put the fraternity's well-being over that of Michael Deng's," Chief Wagner said.
He could not be revived and he died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was subjected to repeated blunt force trauma to his head, torso, and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated as a result of fraternity hazing, with at least one student dying every year from hazing since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, an attorney representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is an important one.
A Monroe County grand jury recommended third-degree murder charges for the first five members.
Thirty-two other fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault hazing and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to hold not only the individuals involved, but if there's an organization that sanctioned it, whether officially or unofficially, we're going to hold them accountable as well," Wagner said at a news conference Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity revoked its affiliation with the local chapter.
Here's what will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
A rate hike will come and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will climb and the economy will slip into a recession.
This we know.
What we don't know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last.
For the economy specifically, history offers little guide about timing.
A recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hike and as long as 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, a determinant in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That's why officials at the U.S. central bank have stressed so vigorously that investors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the trajectory of how long it will take to normalize.
There are, indeed, multiple variables at play.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the rate-hike fuss may have been overdone.
"The first hike from the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of 'cheap money,' " Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
That's not to say there won't be effects, however.
Here's a look at how some areas of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
As the market has seen over the past month or so, anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the hike hits, though, the impact is not as dramatic.
"It does seem there is a trend for equity returns to stall 12-24 months after the first hike, which again perhaps reflects the lag in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hikes.
More specifically, the market over the past 35 years or so is most often up sharply - about 14 percent - heading into the rate hike, fairly flat in the 250 days after (average gain of 2.6 percent) then back to normal once 500 days have passed, with average return in the past six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, posted on Barron's.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to get more pronounced later in the rate-hiking cycle and returns begin to diminish.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often help them along.
In the current case, the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could hasten a recession.
Most notably, gross domestic product will be near its lowest point ever for a Fed rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 rate hikes since 1950, only twice has nominal year over year GDP been below 4.5 percent.
Even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent, few expect that to last, with the third quarter tracking at just 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Hiking rates into such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and set up the question of "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants have been bracing for a Fed hike all year, with all eyes turned toward this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve a hike at this meeting, futures trading indicates just a 25 percent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all hiking cycles to date have been in a super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP eclipsing prerecession peaks very quickly post the recovery commencing," the report said.
By contrast this has been a uniquely slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the sample period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and this is 74 months and counting.
Fixed income also has been volatile as the market anticipates a rate hike, and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equities experience.
The principal difference is that the impact happens faster in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course in policy.
For bonds, it does seem yields change direction immediately as the first hike/cut in the cycle arrives.
At the end of the hiking cycle bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe the hike in rates will cause yields between longer- and shorter-dated bonds to move closer together, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds often perform better in such a climate, though "we are still cautious about stretching for yield," Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens policy.
Broadly speaking, companies that do the majority of their business in the U.S. will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinationals with lots of debt will fare worse, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive the finance.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to outperform during the three months following an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outpaced weak balance sheet companies following each of the 1994, 1999, and 2004 rate hikes, by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital as well as low volatility stocks also outperformed their lower quality counterparts, by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt will become a big issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt stand to lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside pure stock plays, consumers stand to benefit as well through the rising dollar.
Savers could see gains as well through higher yields at the, though experts differ on how quickly that will take hold.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised station for 'dumbing down'
Argues it's becoming increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rival
Also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, saying they just rip off the Brits
Colleague Damien Collins MP attacked The Voice, saying that too wasn't original
BBC Radio 3 is "turning into" Classic FM, a leading MP has claimed, piling fresh pressure on the broadcaster to prove that it does something that commercial broadcasters do not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be "dumbing down" and is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "dumbing down" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards which started last year seem to be the Brits by another name.
So, if you're trying to do something different - those are two examples from the top of my head where you're actually just mimicking what is already on the market," Mr Bingham said.
BBC director general denied the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and educating the public.
What I learn from Radio 3, I am not going to learn about classical music from anywhere else.
And it's commitment to live music and music making is actually second to none.
"And also, Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works I think is also really important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it has to work harder to engage audiences than it did in the past, because Britons are less educated about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC's output which came under fire for treading on the toes of commercial rivals, during the Culture, Media and Sport select committee hearing.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show which the BBC bought in from Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated cost of £22million.
Can you see why that programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a particularly BBC way."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from our own in-house stable" next time it launches an entertainment series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Voice in the future, or spending licence fee payers' money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales increased at slowest ever rate in August and Black Friday may be to blame
First three months of 2015 saw seven per cent increase in online sales
Last month saw lowest growth rise since records began in 2000
Online sales bolstered three years ago by the use of mobile for shopping
Experts believe November's Black Friday could be holding back spending
For over a decade virtual shopping has been booming and turning many of Britain's high streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are leveling off, after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with just a five per cent rise on last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are leveling off, after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
'If you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000, it was always going to rationalise over time,' Andy Mulcahy, editor of IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales were bolstered three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now that is plateauing a bit, you might see (growth) fall away.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which has been imported from America, is being cited as one of the reasons behind the slowing sales.
Experts believe shoppers could be holding off making purchases ahead of the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November .
Last year five times the average number of shoppers flocked to their computers to snap up deals crashing a number of retailers websites.
Experts believe Black Friday, which saw shoppers fight over bargains, could be holding shoppers off from making purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found just over £1 in every £5 was being spent online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now done through web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online, rather than using high street fashion chains.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca crane crash as Bin Laden family sanctioned
Bodies of 29 of the dead carried through the streets by Muslims as the first funerals take place in Mecca
Come as Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse on construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Health Ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed down
Carried aloft through the streets, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 of the victims killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca's Grand mosque.
Dressed largely in white, mourners packed the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad possession passed by the holy site, where just days earlier a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and toppled onto worshipers.
The bodies were released for funeral as the Saudi King sanctioned the Bin Laden family construction group over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 of the worshipers killed when a crane crashed collapsed at Mecca's Grand Central Mosque were carried through the streets
Among the dead was father-of-four Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down.
Mr Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents ahead of the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already vowed that the hajj to Mecca will go ahead with thousands continuing to descend on the city.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have left the crane's arm up when it was not in use.
An Arabic version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The news agency's English service did not report that detail, but did say leaders of the company have been banned from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to topple into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have converged ahead of the hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not released any statements about the crane collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment.
The royal decree also blamed the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and failing to coordinate with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Grand Mosque, part of the massive construction effort headed by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and runs major building projects.
Al Qaida's late leader Osama bin Laden was a renegade son disowned by the family in the 1990s.
The crash came amid high winds and rain just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in hospital.
Officials ordered one million riyals (£174,000) be paid to the relatives of those killed, and the same amount to those permanently injured.
Others injured will receive half that amount.
B&Q boss says Eastern European tradesmen working cheap is behind trend

At same time Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q outlets across the country
By Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent for the Daily Mail
Britons are said to be putting down their hammers and paintbrushes in favour of employing skilled Eastern European tradesmen to carry out work in their home
If you are handy with a hammer or a whizz at painting walls, it seems you are in the minority these days.
Because Britons are increasingly employing handymen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes, according to the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, new chief executive of Kingfisher, which owns the home improvement chain, said a big rise in the number of skilled tradesmen from Eastern Europe offering services at rock-bottom prices is behind the trend.
As a result, Kingfisher is planning to open 200 more Screwfix stores, which are aimed at tradesmen, while closing 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wants more women to be employed in B&Q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in store are made by the fairer sex.
Currently the majority of staff are men.
She said there was a need to address growing demographic trends which have seen more single female households who are doing more home improvements than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "We still have a majority of men working in our stores.
We need to move more towards a balance.
Fundamentally half of our customers are female with 80 per cent of the decisions over items purchased taken by women.
Women play a big part in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of Britain's FTSE100 index of leading firms, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women directors.
Kingfisher is almost alone in having exactly 50 per cent of its team staffed by women, including its chief executive and finance director.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
It has not been difficult to find good women to put on our board.
Kingfisher posted a fall in both half-year profit and sales after the group shouldered the cost of shutting stores.
As a result of the trend Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is opening 200 new stores
December allowance of 600 crowns to pensioners under threat
"It is the justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said TOP 09 deputy chairman Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasised the principle of deservedness.
ODS parliamentary party leader Zbyněk Stanjura noted that, while the one-off payment sounded good, in the long-term it would be better if it were part of the standard adjustment, as it would then be felt in years ahead.
"We have space to find a mechanism to set it up," stated Stanjura,
who supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marksová (ČSSD), according to which adjustment beyond the requirements of the law was to take place next year.
Marksová defended the additional amount, arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she says is not a good one.
Marksová stated that higher adjustment next year would mean an impact of 5.5 billion crowns on the budget, with ministers fighting over every hundred million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right-wing parties that in the past they had lowered the adjustment rate.
Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) highlighted the fact that the proposal does not discuss the reduction of actual pensions in 2016 and later.
The right-wing parties' veto significantly complicates payment in December and will maybe even prevent it, he said.
The ČSSD's parliamentary party leader Roman Sklenák therefore proposed the shortening of the deadline for the committee discussion of the standard to ten or twenty days; this, too, was blocked by the right-wing parties.
However, the committee will have one month, rather than the usual two, for the discussion.
The bonus should cost the state a total of 1.73 billion crowns.
Money is to be chiefly taken from the budgets of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Next year pensions should rise by an average of approximately one hundred crowns.
According to this amendment to pension law, the sum is to be received by people who are entitled to a pension, or part thereof, in December.
It would also be available to those whose entitlement to a pension expired in December, before its payment.
They would have to apply for the payment in writing, no later than by the end of next year.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are regularly adjusted in January by the amount of the rise in prices and a third of the rise in actual salaries.
This year, pensions correspond to 41.5 percent of gross salaries, and next year this would be 40.5 percent.
According to the state's closing account, last year the state spent 314.7 billion crowns on old-age pensions, a year-on-year increase of approximately 5.5 billion crowns.
Expenditure on old-age pensions represented 26 percent of all budget expenditure and 46 percent of all expenditure required by law.
According to data contained in the state closing account, the average full old-age pension last year grew by 104 crowns to 10,714 crowns.
The Czech Social Security Administration paid out 2.4 million full old-age pensions and around 17,000 pro-rata pensions.
Yakunin abandons plans for a political career, will devote himself to science.
According to Russian media, the billionaire was virtually assured of a Senate seat.
He was to represent the western Kaliningrad Oblast, whose governor, Nikolay Tsukanov, defended his mandate as the candidate for ruling party United Russia in Sunday's elections, in the Russian Federation Council.
According to Russian law, senators are not elected by the public, but are chosen by the governor from three candidates, whose names are announced before gubernatorial elections.
The governor then chooses the candidates themselves after the elections.
One complication for Yakunin was the fact that he has not lived in the Kaliningrad Oblast for twenty years, as required by law.
The Kremlin had, though, granted Yakunin an exemption on the grounds that he was an extraordinary and authorised plenipotentiary to whom the legal requirement for long-term residency did not apply.
Shooting of the Czech comedy Teorie tygra (Theory of the Tiger) has concluded
The final straw for the resolution of the main character is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has lost strength and patience.
The grandmother (Iva Janžurová) made the decisions on the grandfather's life, old age and funeral.
Jan can see that he is going the same way with his wife Olga (Eliška Balzerová).
He remembers that once he had his own will and dreams, and wants to live a free, dignified life.
He wants to take back control over his life - and his solution is to run away from the one he has, says Slavík about the story.
Bajgar wanted to use the comedy form to capture a certain type of relationship, in which one of the partners doesn't live a totally free life.
Bajgar says that it was clear from the start that Bartoška, with whom he had previously worked on the series Neviditelní, would have the main role.
Despite this, he says that the actor, who was appearing in front of the cameras after a long break caused due to convalescence from a serious illness, surprised him.
We agreed on this three years ago.
I let him read the script and he said that he liked the sadness of it.
And he surprised me by saying that he was a closet athlete.
In the past he would always ask where he would sit before filming the next scene.
Back then he would cycle, climb up rocks, and even hike up hills -
all of this in record tropical temperatures, adds the director.
According to Bartoška, women marry tigers so that over time they can make rabbits out of them.
They give them some feed, then immediately close the door so that they don't think of playing the tiger outside the rabbit hutch.
That's what we're trying to convey in our film, says the actor.
His wife, who may come across to audiences as a slightly negative character, is played by Eliška Balzerová.
She isn't only a negative character.
She's also good-natured, intelligent, empathetic and has good intentions.
At the same time she's a usurper and wants to cook him to death, adds Bajgar.
The film tells the parallel story of Jan's married daughters Olinka and Alenka (Táňa Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová) and sons-in-law Erik and Pepík (Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák).
The film is produced by Petr Erben from Logline Production and co-produced by Czech Television and Radio and Slovak Television.
Google promises millions of dollars in aid for refugees in Europe
American Internet company Google has pledged up to 5.5 million dollars (132.6 million crowns) in further aid to organisations helping the thousands of refugees streaming into Europe.
The announcement was made on Tuesday by Google.org, the charity offshoot of the Internet company.
Azerbaijan cancels part of Telička's visit due to criticism of human rights breaches
Czech European MP Pavel Telička (ANO) has postponed his journey to Baku on Thursday after the Azerbaijan authorities today cancelled the official part of his visit.
According to Telička, Baku did this following last week's resolution of the European Parliament criticising human rights breaches, of which Telička was a co-author.
The Azerbaijan government's decision means that Telička will not have the opportunity to talk to official partners or visit political prisoners, which depends on the consent of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press release.
Telička had wanted to use the trip, planned several months in advance, to meet parliamentary leaders and representatives of the executive, as well as representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, stated the text sent to the Czech Press Office.
The European Parliament resolution condemns the "unprecedented repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
The resolution calls on European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was passed shortly after the recent sentencing of opposition journalist Khadija Ismayilova, who campaigned against corruption in government.
Russia doesn't rule out building air base in Syria.
On a visit to Novosibirsk, Bogdanovsky did not rule out Russia building an air base in Syria in the future.
We do not have any such plans at this point in time.
However, nothing is ruled out, he stated.
Russia has already operated a sea base in Tartus for years, which it so far used as more of a servicing and logistics centre.
However, according to reports in the Russian press, supplies of Russian arms and military material have increased since the beginning of August.
According to Moscow these are weapons shipments deriving from valid trade agreements.
The Pentagon claims that the Russians are planning to set up an air base by the town of Lakatiya, which is, for the time being, a bastion of support for Syrian president Bashar Assad.
However, Washington isn't entirely clear about Russia's specific military intentions in Syria, agree American commentators.
US Secretary of State John Kerry discussed the situation in Syria on Monday with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov. It was their third telephone conversation in the last ten days.
Next week Israeli premier Binyamin Netanyahu will visit Moscow to convey his country's concern about the stockpiling of a Russian arsenal close to the Israeli border.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Moscow's support for Assad as a lost bet.
He stated that Russia's goals in Syria are unclear
and that Russia had made Syria a satellite state.
This may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a more long-term goal, the nature of which was not, according to Earnest, clear.
According to speculation today, the war in Syria may be the main topic of Putin's speech to the upcoming meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
On the other hand, the Russian leader apparently does not intend to mention the situation in the Donbass, Ukraine at all.
According to today's report in The New York Times, the American government doesn't rule out President Barack Obama meeting with the Russian president during the UN session.
There is, however, a difference of opinion among White House advisers.
Referring to the words of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, the TASS agency today wrote that Putin's schedule for his stay in New York does not currently include a meeting with Obama.
Use sesame oil for a gall-bladder diet - hemp oil helps to strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the transfer of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
The retention of all healthy substances in the oil during cold-pressing from seeds
means that these oils are also suitable as a component of healthy diet, including for gall bladders.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular disease
which, according to the Czech Institute of Health Information and Statistics, is the long-term most common cause of death in the Czech Republic.
Inflammation of the gall bladder mainly affects women, but sesame oil helps.
If you're a lover of Asian cuisine, sesame oil, an important part of original Asian recipes, shouldn't be missing from your pantry.
Unlike the majority of other oils, it can be used in the preparation of hot dishes and has a number of effects that are beneficial to one's health.
It often occurs in gall-bladder diets.
Sesame oil contains essential fatty acids that help prevent gallstones.
90% of gallstones are caused by inflammation of the gall bladder, a problem that affects women three times more than it does men.
Gall-bladder issues generally affect people who are overweight, don't take part in sport and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil is also a very good component of a liver diet, which is very similar to a gall bladder one.
To enjoy the full benefits of consuming sesame oil, be careful about which exotic foodstuffs you buy.
Products from Asia often use excessively roasted seeds, which usually have a stronger taste.
In the words of Ladislav Hačecký, CEO of Bohemia Olej from Kraslice near Sokolov, a producer of cold-pressed bio virgin oil, oils prepared in this way lose their effective substances.
The company has recently started producing sesame oil and uses only non-roasted white sesame seeds.
Our seed press presses 8 kilos of sesame seeds per hour.
Our products are mechanically pressed at a temperature not exceeding 40 degrees and thus meet the conditions for extra virgin oil.
Higher temperatures would entail a loss of nutritious substances.
Sunflower oil has benefits for those suffering from heart and circulatory disease.
The most popular oil in the Czech Republic is sunflower oil.
A study conducted by Jarmila Hamerská (Masarykova univerzita, Brno) found that 43% of respondents preferred sunflower oil when cooking.
Sunflower is not, however, suitable for cooking, as it starts to overheat at 180 °C.
It's better for e.g. seasoning salads and as part of controlled diet, where it helps prevent cardiovascular disease,
as it contains a high proportion of omega-6 non-saturated fatty acids, which reduce cholesterol the most out of all fatty acids.
If you have heart problems, take care about the amount of fat and calories you consume.
For example, one teaspoonful of sunflower oil contains 62 calories, and one teaspoonful of rapeseed oil contains 99 calories.
As far as energy values are concerned, it is important to realise that natural foodstuffs containing nutritious substances are much better than what are known as empty calories,
which you will find in industrially processed products.
We therefore recommend using extra virgin oils.
Like sesame oil and hemp oil, sunflower oil has a lifespan of nine months.
Lifespan can be extended through fridge storage.
Old oil can mainly be recognised from its bitter taste.
On the other hand, cloudiness at the bottom is not a defect;
it's a sign that the product has not been chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the highest quantity of healthy acids.
Their extremely high omega-3 and omega-6 unsaturated fatty acid content means that seeds of properly cultivated hemp are one of the so-called superfoods
and hemp oil is therefore regarded as the healthiest vegetable oil.
The human body cannot produce these essential fatty acids by itself and must be absorbed from food.
The consumption of omega-3 fatty acid is of particular importance.
A scientific study published in the European Journal of Clinical Science proved that daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Males in France and Greece consume 0.6 grammes per day, while males in Iceland consume 2.5 grammes per day.
The recommended daily allowance is 1-4 grammes.
It is recommended to include hemp as a subsidiary part of your diet for the strengthening of immunity and the healing of wounds.
Hemp oil has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential component of cell membranes.
Hemp oil does not contain any psychoactive substances.
Bohemia Olej sells 500 l of oil per year, confirming its
appeal to consumers.
Users often consume one teaspoonful on an empty stomach in the morning.
While it doesn't have a strong taste, hemp oil strengthens immunity, says Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Olej.
According to statistics, America is the most passionate nation about grilling,
with 1.4 grills per household.
A wide variety of grilling competitions take place all over the world, only confirming the success of this culinary discipline.
The Czechs have nothing to be ashamed of here either.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, only 4% of people have never grilled.
The majority grill several times a year.
For grilling to work, preparation is important - ideally meat should be marinaded for several hours before cooking.
Which oil is the most suitable for this, while retaining healthy substances during grilling?
Generally one shouldn't use too much fat during the grilling itself.
Experts agree that the majority of oils start to lose their taste at high temperatures,
meaning that healthy extra virgin oils lose the body of the healthy substances that we otherwise gain when consuming oil from foods prepared at lower temperatures.
However, this doesn't mean that extra virgin oils lose their value when grilled.
Grape oil for grilling, health and beauty
When you say 'meat', the experts from Bohemia Olej from Kraslice near Sokolov think of grape oil.
It's a great supplement to meat and fish.
In cooking it distinguishes itself with its unique ability to enhance the flavour of food.
Due its high combustion point of 216 °C it's also suitable for frying and grilling.
In the words of Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Olej, one of the few Czech companies to produce grape oil, this high does combustion point does not, however, mean that it loses its essential substances - one of the few oils to do so.
Experts agree that grape oil is fifty times more effective than vitamin E and twenty times more effective than vitamin C.
It further contains a large quantity of linoliv acid and is thus effective in the fight against cholesterol.
Grape oil is also an important source of unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
The high quantities of these substances helps reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has positive effects on the kidneys.
The consumption of grape oil also helps increase external beauty, improving skin elasticity, helping to fight acne and in the care of dry, brittle hair.
Chefs highly praise the use of grape oil in cooking.
Not only is it suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example the seasoning of salads, it can also be used for hot dishes.
When grilling it can be used in two ways, for marination and grilling itself.
The marination of meat and fish preserves their juiciness.
Three components are required in the preparation of marinades: oil, acidity and seasoning.
Acidity is added through the use of e.g. apple vinegar, which helps to soften the meat.
Seasoning gives the meat taste and oil conserves it and gives it the right bite, advises Daniel Vlček.
He adds that grape oil is ideal for marination because it is one of the few oils that penetrates red meat.
So your marinaded meat or fish is ready for grilling - what next?
Extra virgin oils are distinguished by the fact that only a few drops are required for the preparation of foods.
The same applies to grilling.
Some oils must not be used for this type of food preparation.
These include linseed, hemp and rapeseed oil, which shouldn't be heated at all.
Sprinkle the grate with oil before grilling to prevent the burning of food.
Side orders are also an essential part of grilling.
Practically anything goes with grilled meat and fish - grilled vegetables, roasted bread, light vegetable salad and many more.
The chefs at Bohemia Olej recommend, for example, Hot Summer salad.
For this, you need: • 1 peach • 1 bunch of rocket • 1 cupful chopped cucumber • 1 cup mixed lettuce leaves • 3 tablespoonfuls of grape oil
Put the torn rocket, chopped cucumber and large chunks of peach into a salad bowl.
Add salt and pepper to taste, as well as ground chili and soy sauce if desired.
Add a few drops of grape oil to finish.
Sprinkle with finely chopped almonds for an exceptional taste.
Multiple sclerosis: it's not just about the medication, but also about the patient's will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and people with this diagnosis need consultation from a number of specialists: neurologists, physiotherapists, ergotherapists, urologists, ophthalmologists, psychologists, psychiatrists and many more.
It is not, however, just about therapeutic treatment - for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultation if they decide to have children, as the care of these patients also includes consultation in social law, recommendations for the modification of dwellings, etc.
Despite this, all of the above is not enough: the development of the disease can be fundamentally affected by the patient themselves.
The more actively they fight the disease, the longer they can work and not have to fundamentally change their lifestyle.
As highlighted by doctors, passivity in patients leaves room for the activity of the disease.
For example, it has been proved that regular movement significantly delays the time when the patient requires a compensatory aid, for example a walking-stick.
It is important for patients and those around them to not believe various myths, for example that the disease will automatically lead to them being confined to a wheelchair.
This is one of the reasons behind the creation of the Dej si šanci ('give yourself a chance', www.bezmytu.cz) website, which is supported by the ongoing Dej si šanci media campaign.
The most important person in the treatment of a patient with multiple sclerosis is the neurologist.
The saying that the earlier you start to treat the illness, the more the doctor can influence something, doubly applies to multiple sclerosis.
This is due to the fact that we have medicines that treat multiple sclerosis in its inflammatory stage, when the process of neurodegeneration is not yet so strong.
The earlier we intervene, the greater the hope that we can stop the disease and postpone invalidisation, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Physiotherapy, which most often deals with the weakening of the lower limbs and balance disorders, is also highly important for those with multiple sclerosis.
Patients are treated according to their individual needs: to maintain condition, improve walking, strengthen the pelvic floor, alleviate swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
"It really is individual and depends on the specific difficulties being suffered by the patient," says MUDr. Martina Kövári, senior consultant at the Physiotherapy and Physical Medicine Clinic of the Faculty Hospital in Motol.
While people with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same illness, it manifests itself differently in everyone.
While physiotherapy does not stop the illness, it always helps to alleviate its symptoms.
Movement also strengthens the immune system, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
A further positive aspect of regular exercise is the fact that patients can check what all they can do, strengthening their self-confidence.
"Exercise also releases endorphins, which help you feel good," notes PhDr. Kamila Řasová from the Physiotherapy Clinic of the Královské Vinohrady Faculty Hospital.
Influencing the physical aspect has an effect on the limbic system, which is responsible for emotions.
It also has a direct effect on the patient's mental state and immune processes, stabilising the disease, she adds.
"Previously, these patients would save their energy, but today we know that they need targeted exercise," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, head of the Physiotherapy and Physical Medicine Clinic of the Faculty Hospital in Motol.
The goal of physiotherapy is for the patient to stay self-sufficient for as long as possible, including at work.
Physiotherapists therefore cooperate with ergotherapists to ensure that every patient receives made-to-measure compensatory aids.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They are in a difficult life situation.
Most people are shaken when a serious illness enters their life.
They experience shock, panic, fear.
They must respond to a considerable burden - the loss of their health.
When our sole aches in this way we should talk to someone and not take the whole burden on ourselves.
"I work with them in a way that they eventually reach the conclusion that they can still live a full life, even with a handicap, and that multiple sclerosis doesn't mean the end of their life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová-Schubertová from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Airbuses couldn't fly without Prague manufacturer Latecoere
Aviation manufacturing is synonymous with precision and advanced technology.
New aeroplanes are full of titanium and light or heavy composite materials that can't be produced and processed by just anybody.
Nevertheless, alongside the superprecise, computer-guided machine tools and autoclaves for the creation of composites, you can also encounter something as ordinary as apricot seeds.
Inside the drum, reminiscent of a candyfloss pot, a mass of apricot seeds are used to wear down sheet-metal parts fresh off the milling machine.
"We haven't found any better solution," smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of aviation doors manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
Previously known as Letov, the company produces complete door systems for the Airbus A320 at its complex in the Letňany district of Prague.
It is the only company in the world to supply doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170 model.
Passengers walk through these doors, part of which is produced in Prague, to enter first and higher classes on the upper decks of the Airbus A380, the largest passenger plane in the world.
Doors full of composite materials are also are also assembled here for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Here, precision is the watchword.
For example, the company has torque wrenches adjusted twice per year.
Should a record of an inspection be absent from the yellow label, the company would have some explaining to do from the Airbus or Boeing auditors, who pay the company regular visits to ensure that doors are being produced in accordance with the agreed rules.
However, advanced technology has not yet entirely replaced human senses.
There are 1,500 rivets on a single Airbus A320 door.
These must be attached manually but riveters.
It takes them two days.
They can recognise, even from the sound of a falling hammer, whether a rivet has been correctly hammered.
The tolerance limits within which they operate are minimal.
A rivet can rise above the aeroplane surface by 0-0.13 millimetres.
That is about twice the thickness of a human hair.
Inspections utilise a well-trained sense of touch.
When an inspector runs their finger along a row of rivets, they recognise when one is outside the tolerance limit.
They then get out a precise deviation gauge.
Before 1989 Letov produced the L-39 military practice plane.
However, by 1991 it wasn't producing any.
The company had to quickly find new customers.
Back then it started working with European aviation producer Airbus.
It won a tender for the supply of emergency doors for the A321 model.
Approaches to Boeing were not so successful.
"At the time we were too small a firm that didn't have enough money for investment or to be able to guarantee Boeing the long-term stability of supply," remembers Dubský.
The doors to the American producer would have stayed closed had Letov not caught the attention pf the French Latecoere group at the International Air Transport Association conference in Prague in 1999.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day we started negotiations with the French, says Dubský.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company, and with a major company came new orders.
As as early as 2000 the company started produced door parts for the A320.
Three years later, they also started producing doors for the upper deck of the A380.
In 2006 the company built a new production hall for the processing of composites for orders for the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere we wouldn't have won those big orders ourselves.
Maybe we'd have been making parts or small components.
Our partners want a twenty- to thirty-year guarantee for goods supplied, explains Dubský.
Last year the Czech Latecoere achieved turnover of over 2.9 billion crowns and an after-tax profit of 147 million crowns.
Having an exclusive status among suppliers to aviation manufacturers comes at a price.
Since 2000, Latecoere has invested 1.5 billion crowns in the Prague company.
The company must have quality certificates, certification for 1270 special production processes and qualification certificates for key employees.
Without these, the company would not be able to manufacture aeroplane doors.
According to Dubský, gaining certification that production processes meet clients' requirements and maintain them through repeated inspections costs millions of crowns.
Production processes change every year,
becoming every more precise and stringent.
We have to give employees additional training, upgrade equipment and have the entire process re-certified, adds Dubský.
The company is currently completing preparations for a metal-plating process using zinc and nickel, rather than cadmium, which is harmful to human health.
Although they received the assignment from the manufacturer, they then had to adapt their technology to the equipment and chemicals used in Prague.
The Boeing people come and verify the concept of the entire production line.
Then we produce their goods.
They also inspect our laboratory.
They test one set of samples themselves in their own laboratory then compare the results with ours, says Dubský, describing the inspection process used by their clients.
The Prague company's reward for this are exclusive, long-term contracts.
The production of Embraer planes today stands and falls with the Prague plant,
which produces half of its total volume of doors.
Replacing the Czech branch of Latecoere would be very complicated, if not impossible, for the Brazilian or European producer.
However, this does not mean that they can name their price for doors.
An integral part of the contract is the price curve.
This states how much doors will cost per ten, fifty and one hundred pieces produced.
The piece price falls to a certain limit value.
We must fit into this price equation.
If not, we'll be losing money, says Dubský.
Half of the hall where the electrical boxes for the Airbus A400 M military plane are being completed is so far empty.
It is, however, a symbol of the future.
Behind the partition they are building a new semi-robotic production line for the riveting and assembly of doors for the new A320 Neo model.
This will lead to faster, more precise riveting.
"This is a growing trend in aviation riveting," adds Dubský.
The future production has its sales secured.
Airbus has announced that airlines have so far ordered 3,270 of the the A320 model.
Only a few metres away they are building a production line for the complete assembly of doors for the upper deck of the A380.
This was a strategic decision of our parent company.
The goal is to shorten the production time and lower costs.
The full assembly process could start within two years, says Dubský.
Before this, however, the company must undergo qualificatory tests for e.g. the assembly of some electrical and electronic equipment for doors intended for the largest Airbus.
The company is relying on the further development of production from composite materials.
Apart from Boeing, it should also participate in the new Airbus A350 programme, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It's a massive boost to the company when it can produce both metal and composite materials," says Dubský proudly.
However, Latecoere is reaching the limit of its production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There is no more space in the Letov complex where it is based.
Before it was taken over by its French parent company, it had 180 employees.
Now it has 800 employees, and might have a hundred more within three years.
As long as Airbus and Boeing will compete over how many hundreds of new aeroplanes are ordered by airlines every year, Latecoere won't have to worry about work.
Despite having orders for several years to come, Latecoere's parent company was facing bankruptcy.
The French group didn't have enough money to cover its September loan payments.
In the end, Latecoere was able to come to an agreement with its main creditors,
who exchanged part of their loans for shares at the end of August.
Creditors gained a share of 37.4 percent in the company through a 57.4 million EUR increase in capital.
Company debt was reduced by two thirds, equal to 180 million EUR.
The second part of the financial remedy came at the beginning of September,
when the company distributed new shares to the value of 222.9 million EUR among existing shareholders.
The company thus increased its base capital by a total 280 million EUR.
The entire group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, who between them have a 85 percent market share.
It anticipates an average annual rise of four percent in orders up to 2017.
Its order book contains orders worth 2.6 billion EUR, corresponding to four years' worth of production.
The French media has said that Latecoere can finally breathe easy after being on a drip-feed for years.
The Czech plant in Letňany is a major one for the group,
contributing 16 percent of its income.
It is the group's largest branch abroad by number of employees.
MPs support greater state share in coal fees
A change in fees for the mining of minerals is to bring 427 million crowns more into state coffers than was the case in 2013.
According to the government, the measure will have a neutral effect on the income of municipalities as fees will be higher.
In the year before last, municipalities gained approx. 450 million crowns and the state treasury 150 million crowns.
Municipalities gained around 200 million crowns and the state 66 million crowns from lignite mining.
The amendment also anticipates the increase in payments from extraction areas with mining permits to one thousand crowns per hectare per year.
The entirety of income generated from these payment shall remain with the municipalities.
Minister for Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that, thanks to this, municipalities will receive 100 million crowns per year, as opposed to the previous figure of 14 million crowns.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but stipulated by the government through decrees.
Payments will be calculated as the product of the quantity of minerals mined and rates for individual types of mineral.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among others, the option of reacting flexibly to the current economic situation.
However, MP Marek Benda (ODS) warned that the setting of fees by government decree may not be in accordance with the constitution.
Minister Mládek responded saying that this would not be a tax, as in this case the government is making minerals - which are state property - subject to a fee.
Fees are received by the municipalities whose territory is affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the money is received by municipalities and one quarter by the state.
The same proportions shall apply to the extraction of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money collected by the state from fees shall be tied to a single purpose.
For example, 28 percent must be directed towards the remedying of damage following mining or the funding of the mine rescue service.
The proposal was today criticised by opposition MPs, who chiefly claimed that it would harm both municipalities and regional governments.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 a Starostové) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, as they would have to pay higher fees directly into state coffers.
"You can't asset-strip some of the poorest regions just so that the Finance Minister can improve his budget," said David Kádner (Úsvit), whose constituency is in the Ústí nad Labem Region
Communist MP Hana Aulická also warned of increased unemployment in the Most area.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed the rejection of the amendment, and Kučera wanted to return it to the government for revision.
The explanatory report states that, according to extraction companies, increases in fees would not be transmitted to coal prices as more than 90 percent of these are agreed on a long-term basis.
The chief consumers, power stations, would not, therefore, feel an increase in prices.
"On the other hand, though, this fact increases the risk that extraction organisations will compensate for increased payments with efforts to reduce their operating costs, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," admits the government.
However, it also stated that a fee increase would be bearable in terms of employment.
According to Milan Urban (ČSSD), who tabled the amendment, a key issue is for MPs to know the conclusions reached regarding the updated energy concept and, chiefly, the government's decision on coal extraction limits before passing the law.
He emphasised that, were coal to be mined beyond the limits, it would have an impact on yields for both the state and municipalities.
Urban does not agree with Mládek on the fact that the decision on the breaking of the limit at the Československé armády mine should only be taken after 2020.
He said that limits at the Československé armády mine should be broken due to social reasons, the national economy and the Czech energy sector.
Decision time on interest rates for US Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets over two days on Wednesday and Thursday, to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found a little over half who only last week thought the Fed would go for it, now think it will hold fire a bit longer and keep rates at the current 0-0.25 percent range.
It's a historical event because it's been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and start a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has been performing relatively well, the recovery adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and generating little inflation.
However the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned markets to be ready for a hike but indications are they also believe the odds are against such a move.
The decision is due to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
Delta State University shooter left note of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" for the first murder and wished he "could take it back," authorities revealed Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Miss. said Lamb, a geography and social science education instructor at Delta State University, called 911 around 10 a.m.
Monday and said he had shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that police needed to send officers over to his home.
He said "I shot my wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house that is "not going to bother anyone" but is likely upset.
Police asked the caller his name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb did not provide an explanation for the shooting.
When police got to the scene they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, that said: "I am so sorry I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she is the only person who ever loved me.
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, before eventually taking his own life late Monday as cops closed in.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but "obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind."
Despite reports Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss was also romantically involved with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" of a "love triangle."
Prentiss was described as a "good person" by Shawn O'Steen, who said he had been married to her for about seven years.
The two divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, who is 19, and she was "devastated."
He said Prentiss and her daughter were "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked an online job from her home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified as a close friend of Prentiss by the Sun Herald.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hound dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb had phoned relatives at some point Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."
When cops caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb pulled his car over, bailed out on foot, ran into the woods and shot and killed himself.
Lamb received a doctorate in education from Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to his resume posted on the university's website.
Stars who lost their mojo
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had a stressful few years.
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009, he lost long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor has also reportedly struggled with drugs, and in 2008, he was busted for drug possession.
All that stuff sure does take a toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw out for months with double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during Manchester United's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this left the full-back in tears and will rule him out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains hopeful Shaw could play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless tackle from Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had burst into the PSV area.
He had nine minutes of treatment on the pitch and required oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.
It is awful - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it very difficult and then plays fantastically and then this happens.
When it was in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I am not a doctor but when you have a double fracture it is six months and he will not play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno appeared fortunate to escape a red card and the concession of a spot-kick.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not penalise the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested the Italian official had erred.
You can judge for yourself when I say it is a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad tackle with two legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "Thank you everyone for your messages, words can't describe how gutted I am, my road to recovery starts now, I will come back stronger."
Related: Manchester United suffer Luke Shaw blow in defeat at PSV
The England defender will have an added incentive to recover with the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very bad injury."
If any player goes off with this kind of injury, everybody is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"He finds it very difficult because the intention was not to injure the opponent, and when you hear it is a very bad injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched it, but I couldn't see the tackle on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I am so sorry.
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital following a challenge by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better than this?
It's one thing any parent soon learns: when your child loves a book, it won't be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless, it seems, you are David Cameron.
Asked by a provider of holiday childcare schemes to name his favourite kids' book, the prime minister opted for The Lorax, the 1971 environmental fable by Dr Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message published on the website of the SuperCamps company, continuing: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's one I enjoy reading to my children because there always seems to be an image or a message that we have previously missed."
All very well, except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book instead gives a précis of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and detail to pad out the fairly brief original text.
"Set in the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," it reads, chronicling a love interest unknown to Dr Seuss, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
If that wasn't suspicious enough, Cameron's submitted text reads in part like a plot summary of the Lorax film provided on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl, Audrey."
Given he is an avowedly hands-on parent, it seems unlikely Cameron is so unfamiliar with the book's plot, in which a young unnamed boy hears how the local environment was devastated by the avaricious, tree-chopping, thneed-knitting Once-ler, despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax, a squat, moustachioed creature who "speaks for the trees."
Most likely, such a relatively lowly PR task would have been outsourced to an aide, seemingly one who has never read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was believed to have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided from Cameron's staff, but had no further immediate comment.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of England omission but it's still tough
Taking on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough assignment but after seeing the squad England have selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat suffered last time does not look on the cards for me.
I wouldn't rule out an away win, either.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the one three years ago but there are good players of spin in that batting lineup and the collective mindset is strong; they will not carry scars from 2012, only a youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is developing as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, represents an attacking option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England Test squad and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to omit Adam Lyth is obviously a tough one for me to analyse as his head coach at Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged on output.
There were no question marks over Joe Root, for example, leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best selectors.
A couple of half-centuries and Lyth might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own destiny.
Hopefully if he punches out more runs for Yorkshire another opportunity will come along.
The England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when he was not performing as well as he can and that does not surprise me; he is a team man above all else.
The question of how long a Test batsman gets to make his mark is a tough one.
Lyth got seven caps - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance home and away.
The only gripe you could have was that England went for Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean first - when Lyth was in top form - but that wasted opportunity is in the past now.
Alex Hales comes in and he is a batsman I rate highly.
He is an X-factor cricketer, which we at Yorkshire saw early this season when he made 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch that was doing a bit.
He must at least be afforded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the make-up of the side in the UAE.
The idea of Moeen opening the batting alongside Cook, which would get the extra spinner in while keeping four quicks, has been floated and it is not something I am against.
I don't see why a strokemaker cannot bat there and this left-hander has already shown he is one hell of a cricketer.
Moeen may not have done the job for his county, Worcestershire, but he has been a No3 for them and there is not much difference.
My old team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at first drop before stepping up to open in 2001.
He peeled off three centuries immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as back-up spinner and, in my limited dealings with him, he has struck me as very impressive young man.
People may look at his raw stats - averaging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt but there are not a heap of spinners putting their hands up and selectors have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Away from the squad, England look to have made a couple of shrewd additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lanka batsman, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a masterstroke.
He is one of the game's loveliest blokes, who will bring a wealth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in for the white-ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless streak into the setup.
I always felt he was born to be involved in international cricket, be it playing or coaching, and like Mahela has nous that can be tapped.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room, even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before, can freshen up a side.
Colly's Durham team-mate Ben Stokes is rested for the one-dayers, Root was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no issue with this.
While not everyone will agree, the coaches and selectors do not set the schedule.
And you have to remember, like players, their jobs are dependent on results.
Such decisions are never taken lightly.
Brexit camp might win the day if economy is in doldrums by 2017
David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day that passes, even without the election of genial Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to the Labour leadership, or the TUC cutting up rough over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages too.
A European diplomat chum explained the other day that, sunk in assorted crises as the EU is - not all of their own making - some member states are fed up with Britain's self-absorbed agenda of divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes which they mostly don't want.
In Brighton for its annual bean, the TUC decided it didn't want them either if they eroded social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
PM and chancellor rock up to summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local grandee, then come home and say they are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European pal, who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have got to the point where they don't care whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's cautiously level-headed chancellor, is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes bad for her, as it did for overstayers Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande is facing re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is a fading force too.
Poland may soon have a nationalistic government of the right, Spain one of the left.
It's hard to see them breaking a leg to help the Selfie Brits, whose energy might be better spent preventing Scotland leaving the UK - something they don't want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even be planning to make deliberately unhelpful remarks, SNP-style, during the UK's 2017 referendum campaign to hasten the Brexit process, my pal suggests.
"The renegotiation was a fix" and "Britain got nothing of value out of the renegotiation."
The Europeans know to their cost how predatory Fleet Street can be and how EU-sceptic the oligarch press barons are, as they were not during the Tony Benn-inspired 1975 referendum which endorsed our 1973 entry by a ratio of 2:1.
They may dimly remember Boris Johnson, the arch Euro-opportunist, making his name as an "EU straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
For all his foolishness Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
They included the medley of tax-shy rascals, phone-hacking foreigners and pseudo non-doms who own most of our great newspapers.
Actually Tony Blair thought much the same about them, but realised that when you're in a cage with a randy gorilla you have to pass the bananas to distract it from having you for lunch and again for tea.
In fact Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposing Cameron's referendum wheeze, since Blair had conceded the principle over the EU's aborted constitution, sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a get-out card.
The press never forgave him that either.
But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re-adopting Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he must develop a coherent strategy to engage with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose BBC sofa he vacated on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I will kindly call evolving.
He says he'd like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukip's woad-wearing tendency and the wilder shores of Tory little Englanderism can probably say yes to that.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and TV this week as the boy scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of abrasive John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s, when his old dad struggled on TV to be disloyal to Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's struggle was more attractive.
But fighting to stay in "in all circumstances" - Benn's phrase - was not what McDonnell was saying, nor what JC told peers and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night, by all accounts.
Whatever the bottom-up, touchy-feely image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he even touched me - message discipline remains important in the age of 24/7 TV and especially in the maelstrom that is social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It's fair enough not to give Cameron a free pass on Europe, allowing him to take Labour's support for granted in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell has said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic equivocation about EU membership - consistent with their Bennite siege economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftwing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of doctrinal squabbles.
As with his equivocation over Nato - Tom Watson is adamant that JC won't campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their masters at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on concessions to Britain when it may all be pointless?
The US is already pretty disappointed with the Brits" feeble military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting Tory government in power, as I was reminded at the launch of something called the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticise Public Health England e-cigarettes review
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers have said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "landmark" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But several researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month attacked the "extraordinarily flimsy foundation" on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Writing in the BMJ, two further researchers have questioned whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said the public would expect PHE's claims that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" would be based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, it comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesise their opinions on the harms associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also endorsed BAT's public health credentials in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 people at the meeting declared funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The rationale for selecting the members of the panel is not provided, but they include several known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also declare industry funding in the paper.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at PHE.
The research paper produced by the group "tellingly concedes" there is a lack of "hard evidence for the harms of most products on most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the claims in the BMJ had been responded to before.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two lifelong smokers dies from their addiction.
All of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small by comparison, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people a year die of a smoking-related illness and smoking costs the NHS £2bn a year.
By spelling out clearly the current evidence - that while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national remit.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 chief
The former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, saying its commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used to make the sort of programmes that are not made by other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes likely to be watched by a smaller audience in tough slots against its rivals" biggest rating shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC's director general, Tony Hall, said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 to do a tie-up with the BBC without success.
"I do struggle with the idea that the BBC commissions and broadcasts programmes that would clearly be shown by unsubsidised rivals," Johnson told the House of Lords communication committee, as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If you keep the licence fee, which I'm not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea, it should reduce its output at least to programmes that others aren't making and commissioning.
They broadcast The Voice in a prime slot because they want to gain as broad a support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show that is a joke, it's ludicrous, it's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without subsidy.
The Voice is one, EastEnders is another, admittedly made in-house.
Frankly other channels would give their right arm for it.
I struggle to see how it's public service broadcasting.
I don't think that would diminish the BBC at all.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was guilty of chasing ratings "because of the ambitions of people who work there, and because they believe that is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments about the BBC's most popular shows echo those of former Sky executive Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell off shows such as EastEnders.
Johnson said the BBC's more niche public service programmes "go on to BBC4 where quite often you can't measure the audience but they fulfil their remit and they can argue when they go on their sanctimonious missions about justifying £4bn in licence fee income, "Well of course, we do all these obscure programmes that no one watched."
They put them on a slot where no one was ever going to watch them.
On the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the best value from it.
Of course you all think, we all think, £150 a year is great value, but for people for whom £150 is a lot of money I wonder if they do because they don't consume a lot of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 executive David Elstein, who also gave evidence to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
He said little of the BBC's output was now formally classified as education - he said it was 1% of its TV output and 0.1% on radio - and it should take a lead from public service broadcasters in Australia and Canada and change it to "inform, enlighten and entertain."
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said only a handful were shown on TV, and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them all available to watch online.
'Sonogenetics' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses that are too high-pitched for humans to hear.
The pulses work by switching on motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said the worms demonstrate the power of a new procedure, dubbed sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical pulses into people's brains to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Nematode worms do not usually react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves which then pass inside the worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels, found in the membranes of some of the worms" cells.
The sound waves make these ion channels open up and activate the cells they are attached to, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To make ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carried TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applied ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves were amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted into the worms, where they switched on the modified motor neurons.
The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over that technique.
Unlike light, which has to be sent down an optic fibre to the desired location inside the brain, low frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered, and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the skull.
"We believe that, using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it may be possible to make target human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
The adverts shaming Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's anti-arms fair video.
Horrific killer drones!
Ankle-shattering leg irons!
Cluster bombs!
And electric stun batons that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The cheery voice and cartoon imagery leave no doubt that this advert for the world's biggest arms fair is a sharp spoof, produced for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to flog weapons to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International's jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign is also leading to many posters cropping up at bus stops and on tube trains that require a second glance.
"Important announcement, Travelling on the DLR from 15th to 18th September?" reads one, using London Underground fonts and branding with the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will be descending on the DLR ... Customers are requested to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who exhibited work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy's Dismaland.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute it around London using "Ad Space Hack Packs," a £6 pack of Allen keys which it claims "gain access to around a third of bus stop advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the spoof ads produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more questioning and seeking to take political work to audiences outside galleries.
A lot of artists are moving to work with activists within protest movements, realising they have to get out in the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the anti-arms trade posters greeting commuters on the tube.
The Amnesty video has been watched more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by ad agency VCCP working pro bono, with the graphic designer and voiceover artist also working for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the silence surrounding the advertising of the arms fair - with a blank space on ExCeL's calendar - and thought: "Let's give them the campaign they are trying to avoid."
They toyed with creating a more realistic dodgy corporate advert, but "by ramming it home with bright colours and animation, it was more arresting."
"They've done a fantastic job in helping us raise concerns about the selling of illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies at Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK government to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms fair comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors flog fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the US army for "the shoulder-launched AT4CS RS."
This includes a "unique shaped-charge warhead that delivers outstanding behind-armour-effects inside the target."
Whatever that does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student halls
It's been 11 years since I moved into student halls as an oblivious 19-year-old, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but it's only now I recall the strained smiles of those I annoyed - and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Most of what I learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving into halls can range from mildly nerve-racking to totally terrifying.
It's tempting to babble: telling people where you're from, whether and where you took a gap year, where you stand on Corbyn and why you "honestly neither love nor hate Marmite because seriously guys it's just yeast extract HAHAHA I'll be in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others take one too - ask questions and show interest.
It steers the conversation and helps you to scout out the people you like versus those you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were dispensing extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often morph into drinks receptions, movie-night venues and communal hangout spots, but they're also where people get dressed and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting university in a relationship
Introverts get a raw deal at university.
Your room should be a retreat, yet many halls form an inter-room-strolling culture that's friendly, social and conducive to lifelong friendships.
That can be hell for someone who's trying to recharge.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go away so I can get back the energy I've expended on interacting with you."
Try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted from socialising - and maybe text instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
One guy in my student halls had a policy that if a door wasn't locked he was invited in.
He saw some things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you're starting uni at the height of Bake-Off mania, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself with a plate of brownies seems marginally less weird, less 1950s "Welcome to the neighbourhood, I baked you something, now smile as I ask you personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your housemates will feel obliged to chat, and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise.
Obviously this is subject to you being a decent baker.
Poorly-fused lumps of flour, sugar and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student halls.
Obviously nicking someones chicken is theft, but is taking a drop of milk for your tea stealing?
Double check with the milk owner.
Chances are they'll tell you to help yourself even if they're seething inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you have my sympathies - but try to deal with it more maturely than my hallmate, who tainted her milk with washing-up liquid to punish those who stole it.
She's in jail now.
You shouldn't make noise that keeps people from sleeping or studying.
This isn't just to be a decent human, but because you are the proverbial people in glass houses.
A girl on my corridor asked her neighbour if they wouldn't mind turning down the drum and bass because it was 3am and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded by turning it up.
When they finally shut up at 5am, she kindly let them sleep for two hours before blasting her own music, locking her door as she left for her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same hall as you?
Conversely, wouldn't it be knuckle-bitingly awkward if you mistook a hallmate for your future spouse, hooked up, broke up and had to see them every day and possibly watch them get custody of all your mutual friends?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants - but if a hot hallmate is definitely not your future spouse, try to at least talk some sense into your groin.
In the exhilarating moment you realise someone's left their keys inside their unlocked room, the line between pranking and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but takes moments to reverse.
Teach a valuable and amusing lesson about security by hiding something - but never trash someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their door and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't Blu-Tack their possessions to the ceiling more than twice.
Eva looked forward to having twins, despite uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva experienced hardship even while she was pregnant with Vítek, who is now seven years old.
Vítek's father had left her, leaving her to prepare for the baby on her own.
I came to terms with the situation relatively quickly - I was really looking forward to the baby and looked for the positives.
I tried not to bother myself with uncertainty and the fact that I'd be bringing the baby up on my own.
And I definitely had the hope that we wouldn't be on our own for long, says Eva, remembering her first pregnancy.
Even back then, on the Internet she met Vašek, who was older than her and who she started to talk about her favourite films with.
Vašek even took Eva and Vítek home from the maternity hospital, but wasn't in too much of a rush to assume the role of stepfather.
"He then took a back seat for a while," says Eva in documentary series Čtyři v tom 3.
The theme of the third season of the Czech television series having another go at finding happiness.
Eva coped with caring for Vítek and supporting the family through part-time work and a lot of help from her mother and aunt.
In the end, even the prospect of responsibility for someone else's child didn't spoil Vašek's affection for Eva.
They finally became a couple around Vítek's second birthday, and Vítek now sees Vašek as his father, and calls him this, too.
Even though Vašek already has two adult daughters, he himself says that he is enjoying fatherhood at sixty, and can also devote more time to children.
Since then, Vítek has been joined by two-year old Leontýna, and even twins.
"Vašek has fitted right in with our family, maybe because my mother has never interfered in my relationships much," smiles Eva.
Not much space?
At least we're close to one another.
Twins Ema and Ela were born by Caesarean section after Eva was diagnosed with cholestasis in the closing stages of her pregnancy.
Cholestasis is a disorder in the production and activity of bile acids, which then occur in excessive amounts in the blood of the pregnant woman and manifests itself in itchiness.
The illness is dangerous to the unborn foetus, which is at risk of premature birth and death. It usually disappears of its own accord in the mother following birth.
Luckily for Eva and Vašek, Ema and Ela were born healthy, even though she was only in her 36th week.
Little Ema was placed in an incubator on an intermediary ward where Vašek's niece worked, who was able to take care of her and see that she was accommodated.
Ela was bigger and I had her by my side as soon as I was taken from intensive care to my room, says Eva about the difficult time after the birth.
She spent twenty days in the maternity hospital until the doctors discharged the babies, who had reached the weight of two kilos.
Eva didn't enjoy the wait in hospital.
"I was going crazy being away from my husband and children," says the mother of four, remembering the difficult moments on the postpartum ward.
She and her husband had considered filing a complaint due to the insensitive manner of one doctor.
In the end that didn't happen and the doctors discharged Eva and the twins.
This story of four pregnancies and births will be broadcast on ČT1 at 9.45 p.m. on Tuesday evening.
This large family knows how to economise.
They live together in a small house not far from Prague, where had to make do with an electrical two-ring stove and modest conditions.
While the house hasn't got bigger, Vašek made Eva happy by installing a gas cooker so that it's easier to cook for six people.
If the worst comes to the worst, we can share the taxi.
Eva is convinced that the children see the comfort of family life and the pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or shabbiness of the house.
For now we're coping quite well, better than we'd expected.
While it's harder to hide untidiness in such a small space and we sometimes step over the rolling babies, at least we're all close to one another, laughs Eva, who can see the positive side of any situation.
As Vašek's work as a lighting technician in film doesn't guarantee a regular income,
he sometimes goes on the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
Even at sixty, he himself says that he is physically managing to support the family and children - but how long will this be the case?
"I realise that, due to the age gap, one day it'll be me who has to support the family," admits Eva honestly when asked about the future.
She would like to return to paid work, but is more attracted by the possibility of starting her own business.
I've got four children, I'm not exactly hot property for employers.
If the worst comes to the worst, we can share the taxi, jokes the good-natured blonde.
Apple hit by the yo-yo effect.
It's all because of the displays.
A more powerful processor, higher-resolution camera, stronger casing and display screen that can discern different touch strengths are the advantages offered by the recently launched ninth-generation iPhones.
The last two listed have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of 6s and 6s Plus iPhones.
Up until now the trend with Apple has been for every generation of iPhone to be lighter than the one before it.
The only exceptions to this were the third and fourth generations, whose weight was slightly more than that of preceding iPhones.
However, the two-gramme difference from previous models was truly negligible.
This is far from true for new iPhones.
Compared to last year's 6 and 6 Plus iPhones, the weight of the smaller model rose by 14 grammes and the larger by a whole 20 grammes.
On the one hand it's no wonder - last year's affair with phones bending in pockets caused Apple some considerable problems.
The new models' casing is made of tougher 7000 aluminium alloy, which also manifested itself in the weight.
However, the displays have a much greater impact.
In these new models Apple has used 3D Touch technology, which helps displays distinguish between the strength of touch.
This meant that displays had to be fitted with an extra layer of capacity sensors.
The weight of the screens of new iPhones thus more than doubled against preceding generations.
In the smaller iPhone it rose from 12 to 29 grammes, and in the larger one from 19 to 40 grammes.
In the iPhone 6s the display is the heaviest component used.
The full weight of this new model, a mere 143 grammes, is then reached through the stiffening casing, which affected all other components.
In the larger model, the largest component used is the battery, whose weight has not, however, increased against its predecessor.
Here, too, the greatest growth has been in the display.
The weight of the 5.5" iPhone 6s is thus 192 grammes.
The practicality of the new display technology will become apparent only through use.
Users will be able to try it our for the first time on Friday 25 September, when sale of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will begin in selected countries.
Have flakes been the breakfast of champions for tens of thousands of years?
Archaeologists in Grotta Paglicci, Italy have made a discovery that opens up interesting possibilities.
They have discovered traces of settlements of modern humans from various periods, including wall-paintings, remains of tools and so on.
However, at level 23A, which according to the tools found dates back 30 thousand years, researchers have found something that is strongly reminiscent of the remains of a breakfast buffet.
At the site they found traces of oat grains that apparently went through a production process similar to the oat flakes that are so popular today.
In this process, grains are first soaked, then dried, shelled, blanched and flattened.
Grains have been found in Paglicci cave that were evidently heated up or blanched, then ground between two millstones - this is at least indicated by traces of use found on two stones in the cave.
While researchers were not able to prove in their article for PNAS magazine that the complete flake production process took place in the cave, the resemblance is quite striking.
We also do not have any evidence of how the people ate the flakes, although the possibility that it would have been with some liquid and quite possibly also served warm, is entirely logical.
At the same time it is highly interesting evidence of how intensively people used cereals, even long before the rise of agriculture.
Thus if the oat flake interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes preceded agriculture by approximately twenty thousand years.
New stop announcement with the Brno Public Transport Comapny
So once again I listened to the announcements of the names of stops in the trolleybus: Hnusáčkova, Přízrak, Frázova, Spratecká.
For sure, the trolleybus was a bit noisier, so the male voice making the announcements was somewhat less easy to understand than before, when the stops were announced by a female voice.
The female voice is higher-pitched, so in the deeper noise of public transport it's easier to pick out than the deeper male voice.
While the public transport company argues that the voice was chosen by passengers themselves - I don't know which ones, they didn't ask me - they must have chosen it from studio recordings made in complete silence, which obviously sounded completely different than against the racket of a bus engine.
I've lived in Brno for quite a few decades now, so I know the correct names of all those stops off by heart and obviously I don't need these announcements, but people from other places who don't know their way around Brno, and at whom these announcements are mainly aimed, might be confused, and if they go to the final stop by mistake, they can claim that the stop they were meant to get off at wasn't announced.
Maybe they should run the selection process for an announcer again, this time with the addition of transport noise and the racket of a motor, in which the mutter of the bus loudspeaker almost gets lost.
Then I wouldn't have to listen to stops called Vodní Heršpice, Šmírova, or Ponorná in the screeching tram that I got onto at Komárov.
In my old age I don't think that my hearing got that much worse in the single day when they changed the announcer.
Before that day I understood the announcements quite well.
Good morning, comrade superintendent
Notes by a railway worker
Few people today know what the so-called complex checks were during the rule of the biggest, smartest political party.
Let me reminisce.
The bus was delayed.
I entered the dispatcher's office at the moment the radio announced that it was seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't bump into the comrade superintendent, he got here a minute before you and he didn't look like he was in a great mood," noted the dispatcher while I was writing my name in the visitors' book.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Write that I've going through the districts to review minor mechanical devices.
Can't do it - the checks are on today.
We're all crapping ourselves because of it, it's terrible.
What's it all about?
"You'll see," said the dispatcher, making a face.
You will next time, too.
I ran out to the corridor.
At that moment the doors to the superintendent's office opened and the superintendent appeared.
Buttoned-up, with a stony face and perfectly fitted uniform.
"Good morning, comrade superintendent," I greeted him respectfully, quickly doing up the two buttons of my uniform jacket.
"Good morning," he replied and I quickly ran up to the first floor, without noticing the cold, foreboding tone that the older man had replied in.
"You're just playing," I was welcomed by engineer Eva, an elderly lady for whom I had a lot of respect.
Apparently she'd even been the superintendent until she was removed by the comrades.
We've got checks on and you only just make it.
How many times had I asked what these complex checks were, but no-one wanted to talk about it.
Apparently they only happen once every three years, everyone has to attend them, and they're quite unpleasant.
At least for some.
Well, they said I'd see.
I pulled a file with periodic announcements out of a drawer. At that moment the phone rang.
"Holcman here, come to my office immediately," said the superintendent's voice.
What's his problem?
We met each other now and nothing..." I mumbled, but no-one answered, all of them lost in their thoughts.
"Hello, comrade superintendent, here on your orders," I reported, barely inside the superintendent's office.
The superintendent was sitting behind his desk, looking over some paperwork.
"Comrade mechanic," he announced after a moment, without raising his head and still carefully scanning the paperwork, "your behaviour does not please me at all."
He threw the paperwork down on the table, leaned on the armrests of his chair and looked at me with a fixed, unpleasant, spiteful, piercing look.
I became disconcerted.
What's up?
Only yesterday his deputy was praising me, saying that I'd settled in very well in my few months in the job and that he was happy with me to the highest possible degree,
and that the superintendent had done very well when he pulled me out of the track brigade.
And now this?
You must realise that you are a railway track technician and you must behave accordingly.
The type of greeting that you used this morning was simply unacceptable.
I stammered that I'd used this greeting since childhood, that that was how I'd been brought up and that I didn't see anything wrong with it.
It was like a red rag to a bull for the superintendent.
"You work on a socialist railway and the only acceptable greeting is 'čest práci' ('honour to work')," snapped the superintendent.
And furthermore, you're still mixing up greetings to your superiors.
One minute you say 'Mr' and the next it's 'Comrade'.
To you, I'm not Mr Superintendent, but Comrade Superintendent.
Deputies are comrade deputy, head track maintenance supervisors are to be addressed as comrade track maintenance supervisor!
Now kindly remember that!
I'm sorry, Mr...comrade superintendent, but...but I greeted you with a normal, everyday greeting.
There's nothing bad about that, after all...and that honour to work, or comrade...you know...I'm not in the Party...
"That isn't one of your virtues, that you aren't in the Party," declared the superintendent coldly, having calmed down slightly in the meantime.
You'll hear more about that later.
In any case, bear in mind that you haven't got that chair upstairs reserved until you retire.
That wasn't good.
When the superintendent told someone that something wasn't one of their virtues, the prospects weren't good for whoever was on the receiving end.
For a moment he looked at me with a cold, piercing look and I searched for words to answer him with.
I was also annoyed by the way he arrogantly addressed me in the familiar form.
He was only a few years older than me and acted like my lord and master - actually, comrade and master.
Jovial, puffed-up, authoritarian, arrogant, whatever suited him at any given moment.
We all used the formal form to address him.
So be it, he's the superintendent.
Actually, not everyone did, the chairman of the Party organisation used to the familiar form to address him, and non-Party members, too.
The superintendent, however, addressed many people in the familiar, especially those to whom he could apply his superiority.
Right now he was putting me down for what was a lot of rubbish.
I thought something about an arse and it was as much as I could not do to shout it in his face -
except that would mean that I wouldn't even return to pickaxe work on the line, never mind become a railway official.
How would I support two children?
And the half-built house!
I was ready to cry, but I controlled myself.
I wouldn't give him that pleasure.
"That's all for now, you can go," the superintendent ended the audience and started again carefully examining the paperwork that he'd had in his hand before.
They summoned me at half past eleven.
Everyone from the office was already there and when I asked what was going on they replied, yeah, it'll be fine.
Only Jožin said caustically how it had been his habit that they couldn't fire all of us because the comrade superintendent would have to do the work himself with his minions, and there was no risk of that.
Here, he emphasised the word 'comrade', as if he knew what the superintendent had put me down for in the morning.
It was quite the meeting in the superintendent's office.
The comrade superintendent was sitting behind his desk and behind the other desk were other comrades who were to decide on my future as a civil servant.
The vetting officer, chairman of the revolutionary trades-union committee, the recorder from the staffing department, the clerk for special purposes, something like a counterintelligence officer in the army, and the deputy, my boss.
And the most important person, the chairman of the Party organisation.
I knew him from the railway line.
A normal railway worker, who packed sleepers and shoveled gravel.
And also a former guard.
There were rumours that back then there was no joking with him, he was a proper monster.
Crooked tongues claimed that he'd left school after seven years, hadn't learnt anything, couldn't do anything.
And when they closed the jail he ended up with a pickaxe working on the railway line.
But a comrade, yes, he was a dyed-in-the-wool comrade!
The superintendent instructed me to sit down.
I had butterflies in my stomach and a lump in my throat.
The vetting officer read the assessment from the civic committee from my place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I am married, have two children and so on and so on.
So far so good, I thought and breathed just a little bit better.
Then the assessment from the Party's street organisation.
This was a repeat of the assessment from the civic committee, perhaps they were written by the same person.
But then it came!
Parents long-term members of the Party, refused to attend the checking committee and subsequently left the Party, allegedly for health reasons.
The superintendent looked at me sharply.
The vetting officer noticed this and stopped reading.
The superintendent instructed him to continue.
It only got worse after that.
I had been a member of the town committee of the Union of Socialist Youth, where I was chosen as a Party candidate.
Irrespective of my parents, who had left the Party, the Party put its trust in me.
But I got married and, apart from at the national committee offices, I also had a ceremony in a church.
I'd let down the Party's trust in me in the worst way possible.
Because of this I had been removed from their list of candidates.
But it wasn't enough!
I had both of my children christened, and when my mother died, I even organised a church funeral for her, even though she was a former Party member.
In doing all of this I was showing a negative attitude to the Party.
Once the vetting officer had finished reading, only the tapping of the superintendent's pencil on the table interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone looked at me fixedly and I wished I was somewhere very far away.
During this I had constantly been silently repeating to myself "Communists - superpeople, Communists - superpeople". What had I got myself into?
Why hadn't I stayed with the blacksmiths?
I could have fixed points without any bloody checks.
But now?
My career as a railway officer had finished earlier than it had started.
Return to the brigade?
That probably won't work, the superintendent'll definitely kick me out for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you vet the comrade under discussion here?" the superintendent interrupted the tense silence with a question directed at the vetting officer.
Well, according to the assessment from his previous employment.
Do you have it here?
The vetting officer was visibly in two minds.
There were beads of sweat on his temples and he was blinking nervously, as if he himself was being vetted.
He nodded eagerly and passed a piece of paper to the superintendent.
"Well," declared the superintendent with a hint of joviality, which was, however, often the harbinger of a storm.
At first glance nothing but praise, graduated with distinction, studied industrial college, worked on commission as a locksmith, met the quota with an average of one hundred and twenty percent.
Except the important stuff was missing.
Where did you get that assessment from, comrade?" he again turned to the vetting officer, who felt as if the situation was starting to turn against him and that very soon he might not be a vetting officer.
The comrade gave it to me when he joined us.
Is that sufficient?
"Well, when he joined us, we went to do brigade work in the district," babbled the vetting officer.
And there they don't ask for assessments, his was a kind of extra, so I put it into his folder.
"So when you were put in a technical job this slip of paper was enough," said the superintendent drily.
The vetting officer blinked nervously and couldn't quite bring himself to answer.
"It doesn't matter, we'll discuss it next time," said the superintendent, closing the matter. The vetting officer was visibly relieved.
He'd managed it for the time being.
"Whats wrong with you, comrade?" asked the superintendent, turning to me.
Suddenly he was addressing me in the formal, so I'm finished!
My vision went dark and I started feeling hot.
There followed a torrent of rebukes and accusations and I knew that I was the most repugnant creature on Earth, who didn't deserve the slightest mercy.
In giving him this incomplete assessment I had led the comrade vetting officer into error and not understood why the assessment was incomplete when I got it from the vetting officer at the factory.
Also that I was an anti-socialist element who, at the time of the building of socialist realism had supported the whirl of religious obscurantism, nay, taken part in it.
That I had committed many things, or was maybe committing now, and I silently prayed for it to be over.
It was all one to me now.
I didn't care that I'd be thrown out of my position as a mechanical officer.
I didn't care that they'd take my pickaxe away from me.
That's work for honest, decent people, not for enemies of the people, as I was in the eyes of the comrade superintendent.
"That will be enough, comrade superintendent," said the Party chairman suddenly, emphatically interrupting the superintendent's lecture.
Here the comrade had made a mistake, a massive mistake.
Mistake? It was nothing but idiocy!
And he got his punishment!
Don't forget that, comrade superintendent!
What can be worse for a young person than to close his doors to the party for a while!
To open them again, he would have to prove that he had changed, that he is again worthy of our trust.
The uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did that come from?
Is he that well-read or was he parroting phrases from Party training courses and meetings?
That's why we must give that young comrade a chance!
A chance to show that he has changed.
And who else should give him that than you, comrade superintendent?
It is your responsibility to support this young, yes, somewhat confused comrade in his efforts to reform!
It is your responsibility as a Party member, of which no-one can absolve you!
In fact, it the responsibility of us all as Party members.
Here the comrade must see that the Party has not forgotten us.
That, as a caring mother, it does not just punish, but also love.
Once the chairman had finished, no-one said a word.
No-one had expected such a turnaround in the situation.
Least of all me.
"I agree with you entirely, comrade chairman," said the superintendent icily, nodding in agreement, trying to take back the initiative.
If you had let me finish, then you would have heard that I was getting to exactly this conclusion.
Everyone nodded their heads in agreement, but you could see that they didn't believe a single word.
"So I was confirmed in the position of independent clerk for the care of basic resources," I whooped when I returned to the office, immediately bursting into tears.
It was good that, apart from engineer Eva, everyone was at lunch.
She silently listened to my incoherent description of my recent experiences, during which time I calmed down.
Once I'd finished, she asked if I wanted a coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put water to boil and got the mugs ready.
During this she talked about vetting practices.
About how they'd give you one assessment, often full of praise, and they'd send the second one, full of dirt, to your new employer.
However, I didn't end up where I should have done, but with a pickaxe on the railway line, so the comrades from the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our vetting officer?
He'll be worrying about where he'd eat or drink what, and eventually it turned out the way it did.
"He'll catch it from the old man," she noted maliciously.
He definitely won't enjoy it today.
Be careful around him though, he's quite vengeful.
And the Party chairman?
Basically much worse than the superintendent, no altruist.
A zero with a pickaxe has great power.
The water for the coffee was starting to boil and the office soon filled with the scent of freshly poured coffee.
I threw a sugar cube into the mug and silently mixed the hot brew.
Perhaps I was out of the woods.
They wouldn't fire me now, and the next checks wouldn't be for three years.
In any case, the comrade superintendent wouldn't let me forget this day just like that.

Village symbol comes to life
After years of inactivity, the wheel of the Chlum windmill is again turning.
Situated on a fifteen-metre high mast, it can be seen for miles around.
People from the surrounding area call it the 'Chlum fan'.
The windmill even found its way onto the coat of arms of the village, population 150, which it was awarded in 2010 for the community's homecoming gathering.
"Back then we applied for a coat of arms, and obviously we wanted the 'fan' on that - everyone in the area knows it," says village mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlum windmill is a local technological monument.
One could also say that it is a memento of the present: it serves as a reminder of the time when the local people fought for good-quality drinking-water,
which in the past was a rare occurrence in Chlum.
It was only in 1910 that the local council settled on a solution that served them well until the mid-1980s:
a seven-metre well was dug in the village, which lies near the turn-off to Číchov.
Three years later the well was supplemented with a metal structure and wind-powered pump for pumping water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, close to the church.
"The structure was built by the firm of Antonín Kunc from Hranice na Moravě at a cost of 2,400 crowns," states the plaque on the enclosure of the mast structure.
After several repairs and falls of the windwheel, the pump reached the end of its lifespan in 1971.
7 May 1973 saw the opening of a new chapter in the fight for water: on this day a new pipeline started serving Chlum.
The wind-powered pump remained merely a non-functioning symbol of the village and local rarity.
The village's dominant feature was put into operation at this year's homecoming gathering.
It was only in 2008 that the local inhabitants decided to repair the windwheel and put it back into operation
and a replica of the original wheel - smaller by half a metre - was ordered.
The wheel was mounted on a mast, which however had to be dismantled in the same year
as the producer of the wheel chose an unsuitable material, meaning that the wheel was unable to resist gusts of wind.
The structure then laid under a roof, dismantled, for several years.
However, as of this year the wheel, mounted on a high mast, is again turning.
On the occasion of the homecoming gathering the village had the replica wheel modified and re-mounted on top of an iron tower.
However, the wheel only pumps water from the well to a blind spillway.
In the summer we disconnected it totally because there wasn't enough water in the well.
It pumped empty.
"In the autumn we'll then disconnect the shaft of the pump windwheel in the suction basket again," said Mašek.
Chlum isn't the only village in the Czech Republic that has a windwheel its coat of arms; however, it is the only village of this type in the whole of the Vysočina region.
A similar element, honouring a local technological monument, can be found in the coats of arms of e.g. Chvalkovice and Zelená Hora near Vyškov, Kuželov near Hodonín, Partutovice near Přerov and Police near Vsetín.
No hard feelings, but I've never heard of Lafata, admits Tripolis mainstay Goian.
"I remember the match against Slavia very well, and my goal, like all in my career," laughed 34 year-old Goian and the pre-match press conference.
Back then our coach was Gheorghe Hagi, we were unlucky to lose.
I hope that I score a goal against Sparta now, too.
Just that this time we won't lose," continued Goian.
Goian has played 60 international matches for Romania and is a key player for the Greek team.
Playing as a sweeper, Goian will face attacks by the Sparta strikers.
A few thousand people will turn up, no hell, said Sparta player Hybš on the duel with the Greek team.
He also has some idea of what awaits on Thursday.
I know Fatai well - he played with my brother Lucian for Astra in Romania.
Back then I saw all their games.
I know that he's a very good striker, that's also why he went to Sparta, said Goian.
Goian did not mention any other Sparta players by name, and was then asked directly if he knew about David Lafata, Sparta captain and top scorer in the history of the Czech league.
Goian smiled at this and directed a mildly reproachful look at the Czech journalists.
He had a helpless look on his face, as if to say: "Why are you asking me about that?"
After a moment of silence he spoke.
We've seen a few videos and we've seen that Sparta plays very much as a team.
It has some really good players.
And Lafata?
No hard feelings, but I don't know anyone else apart from Fatai.
The Sparta players, on the other hand, know very well about Goian.
"He has experience with bigger clubs, you could say that he keeps Asteras's defence going, he organises their play," noted Sparta assistant coach Stanislav Hejkal.
While Goian has his best years behind him, he can boast a very interesting football CV.
In previous times he attracted interest from Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart and both Manchester teams - United and City - but when he left Steaua Bucharest he signed for Italian club Palermo. He also played for Glasgow Rangers.
We're expecting an unusual, aggressive style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, they regularly play in European competition, they compete for victory in the Czech league.
For me they are the favourites in this game, but we are playing at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
We will try to win, just like Sparta, said Goian.
I'm sharing a room with Slovak goalie Tomáš Košický, who's really looking forward to playing the Czech team.
Me too.
But I can say for the whole team that we will fight hard.
Kofola to move from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague stock exchange.
New headquarters would be in Ostrava.
Due to trading in company shares on the Warsaw stock exchange, Kofola S.A was registered in Poland.
Our primary goal is to have the group headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps that we have so far taken in this project are primarily of a legal and administrative nature and do not have a real impact on events within the company, says Daniel Buryš, CFO of the Kofola group.
"Shareholders are considering the listing of the company on the Prague stock exchange in relation to the moving of the company's headquarters."
Due to its listing on the Prague Stock Exchange the company is completing a prospectus, which it will submit to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The moving of the headquarters of the holding company and the related share transfers will take the form of a non-public transaction in which only existing shareholders will participate.
No shares will therefore be offered to the public or new investors as part of this transaction.
"Any offering of shares to new investors would take place - if so decided by the company and its shareholders - at a later stage, either in the fourth quarter of 2015 or the first quarter of 2016," stated the company.
The firm had previously stated that any share offer would consist of the issuing of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and in Poland, including the placing of shares on the Warsaw stock exchange.
Czech Television objectivity test on level of informedness about the migrant crisis
Another short test of the objectivity and balance of news on the refugee crisis supplied by the main Czech media.
This time it focuses on Czech Television's main news programme.
How did it fare?
When they're teaching journalism students about how the media manipulates reality, they could show them today's edition of Czech Television's "Události" programme.
About 80% of the programme was devoted to the migrant crisis.
Apart from the first minute, when CT reported on unrest on the Serbian-Hungarian border and it euphemistically said that migrant attacks on police was a case of them losing their patience (they threw stones and used metal bars), it was a case of the current pro-migrant propaganda - judge for yourselves by the titles of individual reports.
Criticism of NGOs - lots of space given to non-profit organisations that criticise the bad treatment of migrants.
Syrian children in Czech school - story about integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees as not only a threat, but also an opportunity
Travelling of refugees - CT consistently uses the term refugee, and not migrant.
What is striking is that in its stock footage CT consistently uses solely footage of women and small children,
while in the same programme, CT itself stated that 80% of migrants held in the Czech Republic are male.
Summary: Mostly propaganda unheard-of since the days of Communist agitation.
As a former journalist I must say that I'm ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice
Once when I bought a flat in a high-rise I soon found that I wasn't the only inhabitant.
Silverfish moved into my formica toilet.
Pet silverfish, vermin with an imperfect transformation, i.e. they don't experience that transformation from caterpillar to beetle, the young looks like an adult, just very small, and it grows.
I found them disgusting and didn't shirk in getting rid of them.
First by hand and then with chemicals.
The socialist-era chemist's gave me some blue crystals to get rid of them.
I think it was called Zyklon B.
Or something else?
But it successfully got rid of them.
I did something similar with the pharaoh ants.
I used a box of juvenilising agent that would be taken by the ants would take to their nest and stop the queen from producing more young.
But I digress.
As time went by, the insects become an object of admiration for me and I increasingly came round to the opinion that they have the same right to life as us humans.
Furthermore, in my experience, interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success and one pest can replace another.
It's true, though, that with fleas and bedbugs I'd have no problems worsening my karma by killing them.
At our new home my partner and I agreed that, just so long as they weren't climbing around our necks, they were free to tuck into fallen flakes of skin, invisible eyelashes and so on.
After a while their peaceful existence was disrupted by a spider.
It was a normal type of corner-dweller that that settled in on the ceiling.
We'd thought that it lived off normal flies and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort level.
Because it was there for several years, we found out that it mainly lived off silverfish and that it evidently kept their numbers to a bearable level.
Through close, regular contact while we were answering the call of nature we found out that it was a female.
This was because we were witness to the romantic courtship with a partner that was about a third her size. We saw him carefully pluck at the web filaments so that he wasn't gobbled up before it got to the longed-for copulation.
It took about three days, during which they didn't move and didn't react to our checks.
Below the toilet bowl, where the romantic games took place, we later found the dried-out remains of the male next to the female.
After that the spider didn't move for weeks on end.
When we thought it was all over, we were surprised by a large number of small spiders dangling in various places around her.
They soon disappeared.
Some of them had been eaten by their mother and the others had scattered elsewhere.
After a week, the female herself disappeared.
We don't know whether she went somewhere else or died, but after a month she re-appeared on the ceiling.
True, it was the somewhat smaller offspring, probably daughter, of its ancestor from the toilet.
For a while she discreetly followed our behaviour from the ceiling and then moved underneath the toilet bowl, judging our failure to attack her as friendship.
The large number of somewhat more numerous silverfish was again reduced and the spider quietly went about its business of feeding itself.
For a whole year our ecosystem didn't change.
In that time our daughter reached the age where it's embarrassing to use a potty.
Up until then we had tolerated it, but we were starting to get fed up of constantly emptying the contents.
We were ever-more insistent in getting her to use the toilet.
However, our daughter used the spider, which she had a very good view of when wiping, as an excuse to continue her bad habit.
She didn't accept it all when we said that having a spider in the house was good luck.
By crying and screaming she forced us to get the potty out.
There was nothing else to do.
The moment arrived when the spider had to make way in the interests of our daughter progressing in her development.
It was up to me.
It was caught in a jar and banished somewhere into the garden via the balcony.
I parted from it as I would a friend, but after such a long time together I felt horrible, as if I was kicking out a relative.
We assumed that the silverfish would become more common and start to reproduce by geometrical progression.
And what do you know? - a week went by, two weeks, and we didn't see a single one.
I started to speculate about the cause.
It occurred to me that, following the example of the ants, the spider hadn't cultivated them there and that the environment of the toilet wasn't as favourable to their existence as we'd thought.
But then the first medium-sized ones appeared and soon it was swarming with them.
I had to think up another theory for their disappearance and then I realised that their connection to the spider was that, when they couldn't see it, they thought that it was hiding somewhere else and that danger could come from anywhere.
Or maybe they had some kind of telepathic connection to their predator and its rapid disappearance provoked some panic response in them.
I'm am under no illusions about their powers of vision.
They shows some indication of being scared of the light, but never reacted to me waving my hand or sudden movements.
Our daughter now goes to the toilet regularly.
I think she's forgotten about the potty.
Now we just need to attract another spider here.
I'm now transmitting my wish to the Internet and I have they haven't turned their backs on us after that eviction.
Otherwise we'd have to use the Zyklon B.
Ten statements by Albert Einstein that enriched the world.
The things said by the brilliant scientist from the last century will probably never stop fascinating humanity.
He immersed himself so deeply in everything that the results were always incredible revelations.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
He primarily entered public consciousness through his special and general theories of relativity, the best descriptions yet provided of the universe in its gigantic dimensions.
Nor can one forget his elaboration of the law of photoeffect or the idea of the quantisation of electromagnetic fields.
There is no doubt that the description itself and the system of findings in the popular theory of relativity is, for many, so complex that they prefer to use easier points of reference for learning about it.
However, it is not easy.
It would not be Albert Einstein, though, if he hadn't found a brilliant solution to this, too: an hour close to your loved one seems like a minute; a minute in a hot oven seems like an hour - that is relativity.
I have chosen ten out of his galaxy of famous quotes that enthralled me.
A clever person solves a problem. A wise person avoids it.
Two things are infinite:
the universe and human stupidity;
and I'm not sure about the universe.
No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right;
a single experiment can prove me wrong.
What a sad era when it is easier to smash an atom than a prejudice.
If a cluttered desk is a sign of a cluttered mind, of what, then, is an empty desk a sign?
I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.
There are a thousand ways to kill time, but none to revive it.
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. So is a lot.
If I were given an hour in which to do a problem upon which my life depended, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes reviewing it and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand is income taxes.
To close, I can't not quote Einstein's formula for the definition of success: if we take A as success, the following equation applies: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y is rest and Z is to hold your tongue.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín Region to expect changes worth 1.5 billion.
"It's a success when you consider that all four have been in the black for all of this year," stated regional governer Stanislav Mišák contentedly.
The total profit of regional facilities is currently about 32 million crowns.
This is partly due to higher payments from insurance companies, and which are just as favourable for this year.
This fact, too, shows that after some lean years, hospitals can now finally afford larger investments.
{Preparations are therefore being made in Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště and Uherské Hradiště for construction work that will cost a total of 1.5 billion crowns.
The long period when we only bought instruments has ended.
Now we must start to construct new buildings, as top healthcare is not possible without them, said regional deputy minister for healthcare Lubomír Nečas.
The changes are eagerly awaited in all hospitals.
Building work will start next year.
A tendering process is now underway in Vsetín for a supplier for a new pavilion for internal medicine worth nearly 300 million crowns.
The addition of a dialysis unit is planned in Kroměříž.
Uherské Hradiště wants to add a new ward worth 200 million crowns to the central pavilion that it opened this year.
Baťa Hospital in Zlín can look forward to the long-delayed construction of a new central reception and ward, which will cost three-quarters of a billion crowns.
In all cases these are fundamental changes that are the biggest in recent years.
"This is an extraordinarily important step for the region as a whole, patients and doctors," said Věra Prousková, director of the department of internal medicine in Vsetín.
The five-storey building is to be ready in approximately two years and will offer comfortable facilities for internal medicine and neurology, dialysis, new out-patient wards, beds and an intensive care unit.
Greater comfort for patients.
The changes, which will chiefly be noticed by patients, will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many patients share a single room, there is only one toilet per floor, beds are non-adjustable, windows not insulated and healthcare workers do not enjoy adequate working conditions.
"For example, our internal medicine department was built thirty-five years ago and now it's reaching the end of its lifespan," pointed out Pavel Calábek, director of Zlín Hospital.
Within a few years it will be replaced by a modern, seven-storey building connected to the accident and emergency department,
meaning that both doctors and patients will have all departments for acute cases in the one place, and in new premises.
Construction work following the same model in Uherské Hradiště is already half-finished.
The central reception is already in place and will be joined by an internal medicine ward within three years.
"Construction work will be paid through a loan and partly from our own funds," explained hospital director Petr Sládek.
Uherské Hradiště is the only hospital in the region that is able to afford its own financing.
It still enjoys the greatest profits and didn't even make a loss three years ago when, for example, the hospital in Zlín experienced a loss of nearly two million crowns.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent output, we're increasing income and effectively manage costs throughout the whole hospital," said Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the hospital's finances.
Patients of the hospital in Kroměříž can also look forward to changes.
During the next ten to fifteen years up half a billion crowns are to be spent on repairs, new instruments and reconstruction.
Repairs to the sobering-up station will be complete this year, after which work will begin on a dialysis unit and a building to house a new magnetic resonance unit.

Nobody has explained to how I am supposed to keep refugees in the Czech Republic when they don't want to live here.
Following a meeting with his European counterparts Minister for the Interior Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains that other countries are putting pressure on the Czech Republic to accept refugee distribution quotas while rejecting any discussion.
He also adds that nobody has yet explained how he is to keep allocated refugees in the Czech Republic when they don't want to live there anyway.
"We didn't get an answer, and we therefore requested that quotas were left out of the final text," said Chovanec to journalists.
Could you describe more specifically the position that you took into the meeting of EU foreign and interior ministers?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas or the system, which cannot work.
We cannot talk about migrants as if they were bags of salt or flour.
They are living beings who have a vision, are going somewhere, have relatives.
What we wanted to hear from our colleagues was how they would keep migrants on the territory of Member States if they were redistributed.
We cannot imagine this.
We didn't get an answer, so we requested that quotas be left out of the final text.
We did not have any problems with the other conclusions from the meeting - functional hotspots, that is registration points, the protection of borders, camps outside Europe, a trust fund for African countries and other matters.
We have been speaking about this for a year and think that this is the way forward.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
Not long ago we were discussing forty thousand, now it's one hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how will we keep those people in our country?
Ninety-eight percent of people who pass through the Czech Republic want to go to Germany.
Almost no-one wants to come here, we simply don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others, for whom the Czech Republic is a destination country, have ambitions to come here; they get asylum - but interest from this wave of migration, that is from Syria and other countries, is virtually zero.
You have said that refugees do not want to come to the Czech Republic, but we have already undertaken to accept fifteen hundred people.
Wouldn't it be possible to accept more this way?
We undertook to accept fifteen hundred people, but with conditions.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operations.
What will happen with that 1500 is that 1100 of them will undergo asylum proceedings.
They will come to our detention facilities and we will treat them the same as the ones we have caught.
It's a major issue and we'll discuss with Europe whether we can hold people who are registered in Italy, Greece or Hungary,
because Europe's attitude is that if they're registered, they can't be held.
This means that, if they enter our territory with registration, and if there's an agreement, which there isn't yet, it could be that don't even hold those 1100 on the territory of the Czech Republic and then they leave for Germany once they've arrived.
If we're able to hold them for the duration of their asylum proceedings, we will start those proceedings.
If they are citizens of Syria or Eritrea, then according to European statistics 98 percent of them get international protection.
Then they get documents that allow them to travel in Europe.
And I think that these people will then end up in destination countries.
Then there are the four hundred people who'll be resettled here.
That's the second project, which is just starting at the moment, are there we only progressed in that we're debating with the churches about the possibilities for them finding work, accommodation and so on for them.
But that's a very long-term project.
You said that other countries weren't willing to discuss the matter with us at the ministers' meeting.
Isn't it more the case that, not only is the Czech Republic rejecting quotas, it is also not offering solidaristic measures that could unblock the discussion?
And what kind of solidaristic measure should that be, in your opinion?
If the Federal Republic of Germany issues an invitation for all refugees from Syria, that message spreads through all camps in not only Europe, but also Turkey and Jordan in a matter of hours.
It encourages a further wave of immigration towards Germany, because they don't want to come to the Czech Republic.
We think that the right path is the protection of external borders - to discourage these waves of migration, help the needy and separate out the economic migrants.
To show them unambiguously that they don't have a chance.
Fifty thousand Kosovars came to Germany last year alone.
From safe Kosovo, where we pay everything in the country, including police, the courts and state attorneys.
If could separate and not accept them, and accept them solely according to economic needs, then the fifty percent of what the social security systems pay out to them for nothing could go towards refugees.
The number of people held in the Czech Republic increased the day after Germany introduced checks.
Now it's eighty, and on the first day it was twelve.
How far must it go before border checks become even more stringent?
We were worried about capturing hundreds of people.
These are the numbers that we can manage.
We still have several hundred free spaces in brick-and-mortar detention facilities.
Obviously, everyone we catch will be returned to Austria within seven days.
That's out standard procedure.
The Austrians are the only ones who take them from us. With Hungary it's complicated and the Greeks - that's something else entirely.
Where is the tipping point?
A thousand a day?
I think it would have to be several hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people on two, three consecutive days exhaust our capacities sufficiently that we have to resort to crisis plans.
I have an agreement with the prime minister that we would then immediately call an emergency government meeting.
He takes a considerable interest in the whole issue, and we talk on the ophone several times per day.
Should that situation arise, the government can de facto meet immediately and a single ruling would decide on reinforcements for the police and army, let's say the customs service, and maybe the prison service.
Is an extreme option the state of emergency that has been called in some parts of Hungary?
I don't think it'll go that far here.
You must realise that we are in a different position, we are a landlocked state within the European Union. Our one and only Schengen border is at the airport.
I don't know what would have to occur for this to happen on the territory of the Czech Republic. I don't want to scaremonger.
All the information that we have, be it from Moldova, Serbia or Hungary, indicates that the Hungarians are trying to divert the flow of migration to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route into Austria.
This would only marginally concern the Czech Republic - hardly at all.
Slavia pays off majority of debts at last minute
in effort to stave off bankruptcy declaration.
The Slavia football team has paid off its debts.
Footballers have received their money too.
The Slavia football club was in court for the first time due to its insolvency proceedings on Tuesday,
almost three months after an insolvency petition for approximately 20 million crowns was submitted against it by a company called Online Services from Samoa in the Pacific Ocean.
Over the course of several hours, Slavia's legal representative, Zuzana Mládková, tried to convince judge Michaela Wenzlová to not declare Slavia bankrupt.
It should be said that she did have a case.
One of the main arguments was that, the week before last, Slavia was taken over by CEFC China, a large industrial and investment group from China, and Czech billionaire Jiří Šimáně.
Slavia has visibly received money, at the last minute, from the new owners.
This was also demonstrated by Slavia's statement prior to Tuesday's court proceedings - on Monday the Vršovice club paid the tens of millions of crowns owned.
"Everything was paid between 11 and 15 September," stated Slavia's legal representative, Zuzana Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay the money to?
Both current and former players and commercial partners.
Specifically, these included, for example, former Slovak international Milan Ivana and Czech midfielder Mario Lička.
Slavia also paid a fee to agent Alexandre Losenický.
The club also paid fees due to the Prague 10 Municipal Authority on Friday.
The insolvency dispute now de facto only involves liabilities disputed by Slavia.
Either the aforementioned liabilities did not exist in the first place or are subject to lawsuits.
Nonetheless, we are prepared to pay these amounts, should we lose these cases.
Mládková told the judge that "We have the requisite funds on a bank account, which we can demonstrate through the submission of an account statement."
"Everything that was due has been paid," declared Mládková, adding that the only unpaid liabilities were that were not yet due, or disputed.
It is also certain that the judge will not come to a decision within the next few days and that the proceedings shall continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that it really has paid the aforementioned debts.
All evidence will then be assessed.
A decision will be made by November at the earliest.
The judge ordered that the proceedings continue on the third of November.
However, the decision will not be made at this meeting, but in writing following it.

Blanka could have been built so as to not collapse,
but would have cost half a billion more, says expert from company that composed project documentation for the tunnel.
Blanka could have been drilled more safely, says the expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex could have been built so as to prevent the two ground collapses in Stromovka park, claimed Alexandr Butovič, production manager at Satra, chief project manager of the tunnel project,
during a press tour of the tunnel on Wednesday evening.
That would, however, have been about half a billion crowns more expensive.
The complex opens to motorists on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between cost and safety.
"While the tunnel could have been drilled more safely, costs would have risen exponentially," said Butovič,
according to whom the conditions in Stromovka were the same for the whole construction period; despite this, the ground collapsed only metres from the spot where the drilling process started using a safer, more careful method.
"If that method had been used 500 metres earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion crowns more expensive," stated Butovič.
Three ground collapses occurred during the construction of the Blanka tunnel.
Craters appeared in Stromovka twice in 2008, and in 2010 the ground collapsed near the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to Metrostav director Jiří Bělohlav, the tunnel is overpriced, he told Euro magazine.
According to the original plans the tunnel should have cost 17 billion crowns.
Once VAT, which increased twice during the construction period, is included, seventeen billion becomes twenty-one billion.
Once technology, land purchases, engineering activities, adjustments and similar items are included, the cost is 29 billion, which isn't that far off 37 billion, said Bělohlav.
Someone ordered and paid for that.
iOS 9: how to get new iPhone operating system, as Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by heading to the Settings app, tapping "General," and then selecting "Software Update."
If it's ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some have run into problems after that installation, being hit by an error message telling them that "Software update failed."
To get around that, users are recommended either to wait for the rush to die down, or to try and upgrade through iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
That might include deleting apps to make space - but Apple has made that less likely by slimming down the update, and also easier to do using a special tool that will suggest apps to delete and then re-install them once the process is over.
It's worth ensuring that your phone is charged or near a charger while the update happens, so that it doesn't run out of battery.
If the charge is too low, Apple won't let the update go ahead, since the phone dying halfway through could lead to the update breaking.

You should also make sure that you've been through our checklist of all the things to do before you download, to try and stop things going wrong and protect against them if they do. iOS 9 brings new features including a much cleverer personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as tweaks that speed up and fix the operating system.
FedEx earnings mixed, lowers fiscal 2016 outlook
FedEx reported disappointing results for its latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast on weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes ahead of Wednesday's opening bell.
FedEx Corp. said that it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year that ends next May, down 20 cents from an earlier prediction.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes despite rate hikes averaging 4.9 percent, which will take effect Jan. 4, and higher surcharges for ground shipment of heavy or large packages, which begin in November.
The company said it still expects earnings to grow over the previous year because of cost-cutting, higher revenue and growth in online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company was "performing solidly given weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The holiday-hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said that that it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, about the same that it hired last year.
In the quarter that ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42, short of the $2.44 per share average forecast of 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue rose 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping, which has caused revenue in its Express unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
In the latest quarter, ground revenue rose 29 percent but operating income was basically flat on higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit saw higher income because of higher base rates, while income fell in the freight business on higher labor costs.
In premarket trading about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx shares were down $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week seated around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table deciding if it's time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Looming over them at one end of the central bank's ornate, two-story boardroom will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation's economic interests above all others.
The central bank has a dual charge from Congress: maximize U.S. employment and keep prices here stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have acknowledged that there's an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And that third mandate could be the X-factor in a too-close-to-predict decision, to be announced Thursday, about whether the U.S. economy is ready to start being weaned from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate in place since late 2008.
Even though most data show the economy growing solidly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already-cautious Fed officials skittish about adding to the volatility by raising their benchmark federal funds rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously the labor market and inflation is going to be first and foremost the most important thing they watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global marketplace is enough to provide them with justification to wait further," she said.
There's no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself is causing financial market jitters.
About half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate increase this week.
Financial markets, however, are expecting the Fed to hold off, with a key indicator showing only about a 30% chance of a boost.
That would point to a stock market drop if the Fed raises the rate, unless policymakers were to soften the blow by promising that another increase would be a ways off.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will hold the rate steady this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed hiked rates at this point in time," he said.
If Fed policymakers did, "they would have to go to great lengths in their policy statement to hold financial markets' hands so they don't panic."
Other experts argued that a rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would validate the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen had said through the spring and early summer that she expected a rate increase this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labor market growth has been solid this year.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed considers to be full employment.
Wage gains have shown signs of picking up.
And although inflation continued to run below the central bank's annual 2% target, Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates, and needs them, given the tightness of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world started convulsing late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped as much as 16% below its record high in May as investors feared a slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market has rebounded somewhat this month, with the Dow now down nearly 10% from the May high.
For Fed policymakers, the market turmoil adds to the complex calculus of when to raise the interest rate.
"Absent what happened in financial markets and the news about the weakness in the Chinese economy over the past couple weeks, they would be tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now, he predicts they'll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impacts on the U.S. economy are going to be, and they have almost no data to rely on that post-dates the developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy isn't one of the Fed's primary concerns, so technically it shouldn't be factored into its decision-making.
But, in effect, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might "taper" its monetary expansion triggered market convulsions around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central bankers and experts to get a better read on the global economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth-management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreacting to financial market movements that seem unconnected to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee who has been pushing for a rate increase, cited decisions in 1998-99 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point over three meetings "despite limited identifiable implications for U.S. growth," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed those cuts.
The Fed should put financial stability concerns first only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market meltdown, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee.
The latest turmoil doesn't come close to that level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be put in a situation of being scared of a rate hike because markets got upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don't think they should get ahead of the curve.
Need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Frequently referred to as the Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's in Chinatown and not Thai Town.
The market/warehouse is a one-stop shop, offering an dizzying array of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There's even an automotive section if you need to pick up some motor oil.
The store is massive, and it will take over an hour to comb through all the aisles.
If all that shopping makes you hungry, grab a meal at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The store's indoor food stall (good, inexpensive) is near the registers, and has various takeout options.
What it stocks: Need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Items are reasonably priced, and a number of items are sold in bulk.
Fresh produce includes specialty Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet fish, and even fry it for you if you'd like.
A good portion of the store is given over to the massive freezer section, where you'll find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork casings, fish balls, regional sausages, commercially-prepared foods and more.
Who shops there: Restaurant owners and chefs, also single families and individuals.
The wide aisles accommodate both shopping carts and forklifts.
The find: Fresh monthong durian next to the checkout stand.
Where is it: The store is in an industrial part of Los Angeles hugging the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store can get busy, parking is usually not hard to find.
Speed on motorways to remain unchanged.
The Chamber of Deputies has rejected a higher speed limit of 150 km/h.
On selected sections of motorway it will not possible to increase the maximum permitted speed to 150 km/h in favourable weather conditions,
decided the Chamber of Deputies on Tuesday in agreeing to the Senate's amendatory proposal rejecting the speed increase.
The amendment to the Roads Act will now be passed on to the president.
President Miloš Zeman had said at the end of April that he would veto a law to allow driving at 150 km/h.
Also against the move was Transport Minister Dan Ťok (on behalf of ANO), according to whom the Czech motorway network isn't yet built for such speeds.
On Tuesday Ťok supported the Senate's version of the law in front of the Chamber of Deputies.
In accordance with the original government proposal, the approved amendment now allows the increase of the maximum speed from 90 to 110 km/h on selected first-class roads, especially four-lane ones.
The Chamber of Deputies had originally expanded this to include motorways, on selected sections of which driving would be permitted at speeds of up to 150 km/h, but this was rejected by the Senate.
MPs have now assented to this proposal.
With the agreement of the Minister for Transport, Senators also removed the authority of the police to have the final say in the modification of local roads that are maintained by municipalities.
The Senate's version, approved by the Chamber of Deputies, anticipates the lengthwise laying of sewage systems, water systems and cabling for public lighting beneath road surfaces,
saving municipalities money that would be spent on land purchases.
This would mean that municipalities would also not be required to take care of vegetation along the sides of local roads, regardless of the owner of the land.
The amendment is also intended to help improve the protection of roads and make it easier for municipalities to handle vehicles that have been towed away and that are not claimed by the owners.
Municipalities would now be able to sell such vehicles if not claimed by their owners within a six-month period following notification of towing away.
Municipalities will have the option of banning the transit of goods vehicles across their territory on second- and third-class roads under threat of a fine, which also apply to the haulage company.
The amendment also abolishes the option of introducing electronic car tax stickers instead of paper ones, which shall therefore continue to be used beyond 1 January next year.
According to the government, this will save money on the introduction of an electronic system.
Ústí mayor to go on trial
May get 10 years for overpriced Little Citizens' Welcome.
The case concerns the allegedly overpriced Little Citizens' Welcome project.
The police also wanted to prosecute MP Zuzana Kailová (ČSSD) in this case, although she was not released by the Chamber of Deputies.
According to the legal classification of the case, both may receive prison sentences of up to ten years.
The main trial is currently planned for two days in October.
The indictment states that, according to the state prosecutor, Mandík and Macík caused damage to the minimum amount of one million crowns.
The prosecutor's case is based on an expert report.
According to the prosecutor, former members of the city authority used their official roles to gain assets to the benefit of the company that organised the Little Citizens' Welcome.
According to the indictment, Mandík tasked the then head of the municipal services, education and culture department of the Ústí nad Labem city authority with a tender process for five interconnected companies.
When another company offering the lowest price entered the competition, the authority cancelled the process.
The city is then said to have entrusted the contract to an administrator and the competition was only entered by Darothore, which was then awarded the contract by the city council.
The city paid a minimum million crowns more than it should have done.
Both the accused, led by the goal of ensuring that Darothore was awarded the public contract for the organisation of the Little Citizens' Welcome event in Ústí nad Labem, conducted coordinated actions over an extended period of time that were, at the very least, in breach of the requirement for process that is in line with that of good management, writes the state prosecutor.
It continues to state that, at the same time, they were aware Darothore, following its awarding of this contract, charged Ústí nad Labem a price for the realisation of the Little Citizens' Welcome event that was disproportionately excessive compared to the true value of services actually provided.
According to records, the company received more than five million crowns over three years.
In the end, the city only paid approximately 1.7 million crowns of this then withdrew from the contract.
According to the expert report, the amount paid was excessive by at least one million crowns.
Mandík had previously denied any breach of the law.
I didn't commit any criminal offence, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this fabricated affair, said the already former mayor, also saying that, under his leadership, the city was only continuing a similar project from previous years.
The event was organised by the Roxy II agency in the years 2008-2010.
"It was under the same conditions, for the same amount of money," added Mandík.
Criminal investigators originally also wanted to charge MP Kailová, who had also been a member of the city council.
However, the Chamber of Deputies did not release her for prosecution.
Criminal investigators therefore adjourned the case regarding her, but anticipate charging Kailová once her mandate in the Chamber of Deputies ends.
The Little Citizens' Welcome was a social event that took place several times per year.
In it, mothers received cheques worth 5 thousand crowns to buy children's goods and small gifts.
Hungarian police allegedly set a dog on a refugee,
then forced journalists to delete footage.
Hungarian police on the border with Serbia allegedly briefly detained an AP cameraman and forced him to delete footage allegedly showing a police dog knocking a refugee to the ground.
However, this accusation is questioned by the Hungarian government.
The alleged incident occurred on Saturday evening, when AP cameraman Luca Muzi was filming migrants crossing the border with Serbia through a cornfield close to the Hungarian town of Röszke.
Police intervened against the refugees and one of them set a dog with a muzzle on one Syrian.
The dog rolled the man, who was shouting "Please, please, I'm a refugee," over onto the ground, claims Muzi.
The fact that Muzi was filming this was noticed by one police officer, who stopped him from leaving.
The journalist was then forbidden from phoning either his superiors or his colleagues in situ.
The policemen led Muzi off to a dark room by the registration centre for refugees and requested that he show them what he had recorded.
They then ordered him to delete the recording.
Muzi thus lost the results of two days' work in Serbia and Hungary.
He said that he felt as if he was in danger due to the presence of the dogs.
AP sent a letter of protest to Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács.
In it, the agency described the behaviour of the police as unacceptable and stated that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and without fear that the government would destroy legally obtained material.
With reference to the police report, Kovács questioned Muzi's version of events.
He said that the police had only wanted him to show them whether they were in some pictures, to which they allegedly had a right.
When they found that they weren't, they didn't force him to delete anything.
"Dogs may bark - they're trained to do so to deter people and spread a bit of fear, but they certainly didn't attack," claims Kovács.
The unpredictable Champions League
Win at City will give us a boost, believe Juventus
"It's disappointing, I don't think we deserved to lose," said City coach Manuel Pellegrini, shaking his head.
We had more chances and played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League match.
Neither team created many chances, but we had the ball for longer.
"The defeat wasn't due to tactics, Juventus just scored two beautiful goals," said Pellegrini, whose team conceded a goal for the first time in 636 minutes of competitive action.
Prior to the game, last season's finalists Juventus were in the exact opposite situation - after three rounds of Serie A, the defending champions have only one point, with two goals scored and four conceded, and are 16th in the table.
For this reason, too, the turnaround at the Etihad was surprising.
"This win will help us psychologically, it'll give us a boost," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who lost three mainstays - Pirlo, Tévez and Vidal - before the start of the season.
In Manchester they were replaced by Pogba, Mandžukić and Morata.
"That's true, this is a really important victory, hopefully it can help us get on a winning run," hopes Morata.
Because when we're on one, we're among the best teams in Europe.
We were the better team in the second half, especially when we were attacking.
The players deserve this result.
"Before our equaliser we could have conceded for 2:0, but Gianluigi kept us in there," Allegri was full of praise for goalkeeper Buffon.
"We wasted several good chances," said City midfielder Yaya Touré.
We'll have to put this down to experience and try and get a better result next time.
Farewell Angela, farewell old Germany II.
Before we further discuss the issue of immigrants, we should realise that the whole media hysteria is directed by professionals,
both according to the needs of the media and from above.
So let's pause for a moment.
Nowadays the newspapers are full of small children being carried on their parents' arms on the dusty journeys of the exodus.
This automatically provokes feelings of guilt and sympathy in people - that is, European people.
Well, it isn't just desperate children coming here; take a look at the boats landing at the Greek islands and you won't see too many children!
The news recently has been somewhat lacking in footage of boats going towards Lampedusa, refugees at the French border by Menton, on whose beautiful you'll see thousands of young men lounging around.
Most of them are young black men.
Nor do you see footage from Calais, where these black and dark-skinned men are waiting to see if they can get through the Channel Tunnel.
But that's not so touching.
Even those pictures of the primitive Christian church set up by the Eritreans didn't make such a big impression on Europeans.
It seemed too false.
When they're talking about refugee quotas, they somehow fail to mention that it's just about those poor children from Syria, but also those stylish - for those of an older generation: fashionably attired - young men,
who with their muscles look like they just stepped out of a fitness centre.
Here's a personal experience.
This summer we were lying on the private beach of a hotel in the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus.
Regardless of the fact that it was a private beach, suddenly a large group of cars arrived.
They weren't exactly old bangers.
Some young black people got out of them.
About thirty men and five women.
Aged between 15 and 30.
They went onto the beach, all of them dressed in designer clothes and shoes. Holding, of course, smartphones.
No-one cared about the fact that it was a private beach - not even the employees - Turks, Muslims! - they were evidently afraid of them.
They took over all the sun loungers.
If you weren't lying on one and were in the sea, bad luck.
They were dressed like something out of an American rapper film.
Hats and nail on their heads, white and colourful Adidas trainers on their feet.
Then they took over the local beach bar and started partying.
They took over the tables round about and squeezed in next to the sitting dark-skinned and white - i.e. Muslim and European - customers without asking.
Mothers and children ran away from the dining patio to somewhere quiet.
The blacks who had arrived drank beer straight from small bottles - like in American serials?! - they discarded the empty bottles on the beach round about them.
They were constantly shouting loudly at one another.
Not in English of course.
Then they started drinking wine, also straight from the bottle.
They jumped into the hotel swimming-pool - in designer swimwear, especially the young ladies - screamed and shouted in the water, while mothers and children and pensioners ran away, terrified, and after half an hour there wasn't a single non-black person on the beach or in the pool.
Everyone had disappeared.
Regardless of whether they were Christian or Muslim.
The hotel employees were scared to even talk about them.
The waiter said to me in a low voice: "Did you see the gold they had on them?"
"Yeah," I said.
"They definitely didn't get that from working," said the waiter.
I remembered: "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had a massive gold cross, maybe twenty centimetres long, on his neck.
And the women were dressed like in a goldsmith's.
"Are they drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You saw how they were boozing," replied the waiter.
They don't smuggle or use drugs.
They smuggle something else entirely.
Then it was clear to me what they were smuggling.
However, in June 2105 [sic] that wasn't yet so important to me.
I had no idea what was to follow.
But the secret services and leading politicians should be the first to know.
I don't think they wouldn't know.
At that time about 1.5 million immigrants were on their way to Europe.
And they come and come and come.
Now we have seen that the chief problem of the European Union is that it is the militantly politically correct politicians pretending to be intellectuals and the lobbying and economic groups associated with them that hold the greatest power.
Germany and its politicians - nowadays publically recognised as the main force in Europe - lie, lie and lie - and not just them, as well as EU heads of state and television, including ours.
For example, the recent television footage of the enthusiastic welcoming of refugees is on the level of footage shown on Russian television in August 1968.
Of course there were a few trendy liberals at the station, but mainly it was - established German - Muslims that were welcoming them.
For weeks on a lot of nonsense was spoken on Czech Television about how, according to some survey or other, almost all Germans were in favour of welcoming emigrants.
However, anyone who has spent just a few days in Germany knows that this is a massive lie.
This is confirmed by further information,
for example the famous public opinion survey conducted by ARD, the Consortium of Public Broadcasters in Germany.
Even a week ago it was still being claimed by ARD that more than 50% of Germans wanted to accept even more refugees.
This was also reported on Czech television.
However, they kept quiet about what broke the next day in Germany: an opinion poll showed that 94.5 percent of Germans didn't want to accept any more immigrants - 67,000 people took part in the poll.
It is true that five years ago, in 2010, Chancellor Merkel declared publicly: "Our efforts to establish a 'multi-culti' society have totally failed."
She further said: "Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society."
"All efforts for such coexistence have failed totally."
According to Merkel, in a country with four million Muslims, the strategy that allows people from varying cultural environments to live alongside one another without integrating has not proved successful. Today they live here with us and we have lied to ourselves for some time that they will not stay, and go away again some day.
This is not, however, the reality.
The multicultural approach, when we tell ourselves that we will just live happily alongside one another, has failed.
It has failed completely.
However, even Merkel probably does not have the power to oppose those holding the power in Germany and Europe, and mainly political correctness.
This is shown in the escalation of events.
Conflict is rapidly increasing.
The Eurogerman Schulz, President of the European Parliament, MEP for the SPD, is allegedly the only member of the Parliament who does not have a school-leaving certificate - yes, he is the one about whom Berlusconi said in the EU Parliament that he could play a concentration-camp guard - has made a spectacle of himself several times.
It appears, particularly in light of recent statement by German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
We must take note that, apart from some, the majority of European politicians do not support these statements and that the politicians of countries that were the victims of Nazism are horrified.
What has happened to the Germans?
The rich, successful and reliable Germans?
Those who for years tried, at least outwardly? to come to terms with their terrible past as aggressors and murderers of millions?
Are those who say that it is part of the soul of Germany to sow the seeds of aggressiveness, superiority and violence, right?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he exerted all his powers to prevent advocates of the Greater German solution to German unification from taking control of the whole centre of Europe?
When he said that the Greater German idea would destroy Germany?
Probably.
Once he was deposed, preparations started for the First World War.
The Greater German idea, which led the Germans and Europe into two world wars and cost millions of lives, has probably returned in another form.
Following Marxist attempts to take over the country, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, after the failure of the GDR, a new German ideology, based for example on ecology, which was, for example, one of the chief ideological branches of Nazism, started to develop.
We could call it trendy liberal.
The German elites long prevented the creation of German nationalism, and therefore left all the fighters against atomic power, enthusiasts seeking paradise for all in peace and tacitly supported the old imperial and Nazi slogan Unser Wald muss leben ('our forest must live').
To appease the restless young people who, all over the world, want to do things differently and better, they fully went over to the side of those fighting against global warming, closed nuclear power plants, etc.
In this they forgot that within this stream of thought there is also a strongly antisemitic - pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slavonic element, considering all Slavs to be troublesome vermin - that goes right back to Karl Marx, a Jew by descent, who was mainly a German nationalist.
As shown in recent statements by Schulz and German ministers, openly threatening the disobedient Eastern countries, this also includes the idea of Germany in a leading role,
and which must be listened to without excuses,
or woe betide you!
When we add to this the fact that immigrants are a highly suggestible group of voters, we have what we have.
Standing behind this is, as ever, capital, particularly German capital, which suits it and which lives off the fact that, through the banks and Union, Germany actually controls the majority of states of the European Union.
The pseudobeliefs of trendy liberals first led Germans into the swamp of ecologicalism and multiculturalism and has now brought them, and may still bring them, millions of Muslims
who, attracted by the siren calling, will soon run up against the wall of reality that Merkel does want to see, and will start to rebel.
Again, Germany can only threaten its neighbours with force, again it can ideologically captivate part - and it appears that it is an increasingly small part - of its population; however, reality will, as ever, catch up with it.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim shelters are already burning.
What will the German government do when public protests break out in Germany against the coming Islamists?
Islamists who will be aided by Muslims who have been living in Germany for years, but have not been integrated so that they accept local habits and laws?
What will the German government do when it admits naturalised Muslims, Islamists who have arrived in the country and Germans, following the Islamisation of their country with fear?
What will happen to Germans, and Germany itself, when people rise who loudly and publicly protest against the new Euro-superhuman, the Muslim?
Germany has simply changed.
The conflict that it has provoked through its support of trendy liberal ideology, i.e. ideology that is elitist and, in essence, totalitarian, and of its insatiable banks, will grow.
And, thanks to its rude behaviour towards disobedient, democratic Germans and all of its inferior, disobedient Eastern neighbours, this cannot end well.
Final part tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of pushy salesmen: scare them to death.
All you have to do is knock and the robust doorknocker snarls at you in a way that's not for the faint-hearted.
When it comes to life the head'll put anyone in its place, even the toughest, and the pushy salesman is accompanied on their way (or rather, driven away) by a living statue.
Maybe it's a shame that you can't get a talking doorknocker in real life.
Here it'd be good for scaring off all sorts of tricksters and bastards.
Creeping woodsorrel (Oxalis corniculata).
A minor weed that tolerates dry environments.
So you can find it between the outside paving near where I live.
On 16 September 2015 I photographed this exquisite plant which, while it is one of the expansive weeds, its appearance creates a good impression from the point of view of blossoming.
It can be found between outside paving.
It's unpredictable, and thrives in our garden.
It likes drier environments and is highly adaptable, modest and undemanding.
Although it produces leaves with a chaotic composition, it's still worth observing and photographing it.
The beauty in the detail can only be seen under the microscope - yellow flowers and green leaves with a purple trim.
Brazil's Pediatric Society of Rio Grande Promotes Healthy Breastfeeding Diets
Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try and get women to understand the importance of good nutrition while breastfeeding, by featuring images of babies suckling from breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk is composed of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates, which give babies all the nutrients they need to grow a strong immune system.
Due to excess energy requirements, pregnant women and new moms are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic expression of their babies and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diets were found to negatively affect the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates ratings, despite Nine's attempts to cover the leadership spill on Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's dash to Canberra to cover the aftermath of the Liberal leadership spill has failed to generate much of a ratings boost for Today.
Nine's breakfast show screened from the national capital after Malcolm Turnbull's overthrow of Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international telecasts which also include Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
That tyranny of distance didn't seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers with Sunrise averaging 397,000 viewers across the five capital cities to Today's 339,000.
Today scored a slight uptick compared to its ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000) but its figure was behind last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has been closing the gap on Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the start of the year the gap was running at between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise is averaging 349,000 viewers to Today's 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than Parliament this morning folks!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for checking!

The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to relocate to seaside New Zealand with his two children, averaged a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered whether Thomson could carry a hit show solo without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result answered that with a resounding "yes."
Seven's The X Factor stayed strong with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed fortunes on night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (5pm to 5.30pm) of the new quiz show hosted by Andrew O'Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (5.30pm to 6pm) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half-hour a whopping 720,000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second night ratings drop will have Nine quietly confident that Hot Seat will ultimately prevail at 5.30.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute which failed to dent McGuire's show.

The final three agree Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman who Sam Wood ends up with on The Bachelor has been swathed in utmost secrecy.
And the three girls left standing certainly aren't letting slip whether they are the one who received his final rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three become two, they may have inadvertently given away a clue as to who the winner will be.
Sam Wood is keeping his lips firmly sealed until Thursday's finale
All three women waxed lyrical over why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humour, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons they would each love to be his partner.
However when asked the question, "If not you, who should get Wood's final rose?," their answers could have provided a spoiler as to who won the Bachelors heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were quick to name Mackay as, apart from themselves, the best match for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared an easy rapport since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, reading (Sarah's) energy and Sam's energy I felt like they were quite compatible and I kept thinking that throughout the course of the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is really down to earth, she's so much fun to be around," added Markoski.
I've seen them together and they do have that chemistry there.
They do feel nice and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
For her part, Mackay said last week's home visit dates made her realise Wood could be "the one."
"Once I saw him with my friends and family I realised this obviously isn't just a game - I'm wholeheartedly invested in him now," she said.
And asked who Wood should choose if not her, she was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can say," she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor airs Wednesday, 7.30pm on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options of where to begin his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed plenty of interest after his move to the US - and there were plenty of other teams making inquiries after his impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it's looking like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have benched Hayne for the rest of the game for losing a fumble like the Aussie rugby league convert did on his first punt return in Tuesday's 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed faith in his man, giving Hayne the next opportunity to return a punt and including him in the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true colours in the locker room after the game.
Instead of chewing out his rookies in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also backed Hayne publicly in his post-match press conference.
49ers beat reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received encouragement from special teams co-ordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about his dropped catch and worry about the next play.
Jarryd Hayne fumbles a punt that was recovered by the Minnesota Vikings during the first quarter
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had been hoping for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was seen cursing as he made his way from the field after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 he couldn't have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was just one of those things, you just worry about the next play and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne likened the blunder to his Origin debut back in 2007 when a pass in his own in-goal led to a Queensland try.
Overall it was still an amazing experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it to his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's wealthiest man, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian runway.
Having openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, seized and his pro democracy efforts curtailed.
Constitutional Court supports emigrants who made claim for return of property
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by someone else.
As it wasn't possible to return their property after 1989, the couple turned to the state with a request for compensation according to the law on out-of-court rehabilitation.
The court had initially awarded them the requested amount, which was over 2.8 million crowns; however, the court of appeal altered their claim by only awarding them 90 thousand crowns, stating that damages were determined according to price regulations from 1991.
The emigrants were supported by the Supreme Court, which awarded them the original amount.
However, the Ministry of Finance, which was to pay the money, took a complaint to the Constitutional Court.
In the interim, such social and economic changes have occurred that the compensation awarded according to the statutory regulations applicable at the time, today only cover a fraction of the value of the real estate, even if, at the time, they did provide adequate coverage.
"This cannot be held against secondary parties as persons entitled under restitution law who are pursuing claims from at least 1995, and who did not have the opportunity to claim compensation before this," said judge Jaroslav Fenyk in explanation of why the Constitutional Court supported the emigrants.
"The Constitutional Court has repeatedly advocated for general courts to approach restitutional matters for any inconsistencies were not interpreted so as to be to the disadvantage of justified parties and for the goal of restitution legislation to be achieved, that is to redress the injustices relating to property that were caused by the acts of the previous totalitarian state," added the judge.
Evita now played by Radka Fišarová in Studio DVA musical
Radka Fišarová had become the youngest Evita in the world in 1998, when she played the role of Eva Perón, wife of the Argentinian dictator, at the age of twenty in the first Czech-language production of the famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice at the Spirála theatre.
On her return to the role she says: "To this day, many productions have not come to terms with how demanding Evita is."
Evita isn't just an amazing role, it's a responsibility.
She was recommended for the role of the first lady of Argentina by Monika Absolonová.
I saw Monika in Evita three times and she was definitely an inspiration to me.
I suddenly saw a new approach here.
By and large I am a fan of modern adaptations, but this one is particularly successful.
"Ondřej Sokol's direction is original, relaxed and contemporary," says Fišarová.
The handing over of the baton between the two singers will take place at Monika Absolonová's Birthday Concert, which takes place from 7 p.m. on 27 September at the Studio DVA theatre.
The evening will culminate with excerpts from the musical Evita.
One of the great experiences will definitely be the duet of Don't Cry For Me Argentina.
In a limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol will swop the conductor's podium for the stage, when he replaces Karel Roden in the role of president Perón during the making of a film.
Due to public interest, further performances up to May 2016 have been scheduled.
The fifth Czech production of the worldwide musical Evita has been successfully performed by the Studio DVA theatre in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London since February 2015.
Under director Ondřej Sokol the female lead was first played by Monika Absolonová.
She is joined by Karel Roden in the role of president Perón and Petr Strenáčik as Che.
The legendary songs by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, with Czech translations by Michael Prostějovský, are presented with accompanied by a live orchestra led by Kryštof Marek, who contributed to the first production at the Spirála theatre.
4 Killed After Police Fire Rubber Bullets at Protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the chief district officer, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, some of them throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less-lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death toll.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces established under the proposed new constitution would dilute their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal from ethnic Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officials, have been killed in violent clashes since Aug.
10, when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step toward a new constitution but a highly contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers have been voting on clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials have said that the new charter could be enacted by Sunday.

NHC says 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecaster added.
Google launches donation-matching campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a donation-matching campaign that aims to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations aiding the thousands of refugees that have overwhelmed European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google took an uncharacteristically personal approach in announcing the donation drive on its blog.
Rather than having an executive make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experience.
"Our journey involved many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperate for help.
The donations will go toward four nonprofit organizations that are providing aid to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will match the first $5.5 million worth of donations globally at google.com/refugeerelief until it raises $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely driven by the four-year-old civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery may be helpful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
It's still to early to say whether mildly obese people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments, however.
"The mortality data take a long time to show up," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, or bariatric surgery, use various methods to shrink the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies were done in people who are morbidly obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or above.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 in a trial comparing two kinds of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The average BMI among those who had surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI among those receiving non-surgical diabetes treatments stayed about the same at 29.
Among those who had surgery, diabetes resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 percent.
In the medically-treated group, by comparison, diabetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent.
In addition, control of blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "was generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patients' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflect blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained steady at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected by the improved hemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce the mortality rate at five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared average outcomes with the two types of surgery.
At the fifth year, compared to the sleeve gastrectomy group, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 vs 14.2 kg), achieved larger drops in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and in hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent vs 2.1 percent) and were more likely to have complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent vs 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show a survival benefit or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery does lead to a longer life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who had bariatric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years, compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Though the new study didn't show a benefit in survival among surgery patients, Blackstone said it's reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is where this paper is critical, because it says this surgery is safe in that lower BMI group," with no increased risk of death or renal disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient's BMI falls between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this," she said.
I think that once they've accumulated these genetic changes that hardwired their bodies into obesity and diabetes, reversing that is really hard.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe could not host all refugees, the Dalai Lama has said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for the ending violence in the refugees" home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He claimed that, under current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of single nations or even continents.
He also stressed that, however admirable, the West-European countries" response to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
"It it's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany's and Austria's efforts in dealing with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"So taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the mean time you have to think about long-term solutions, how to bring genuine peace and genuine development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he emphasized.
Ultimately we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We have to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following 9/11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the US" violent response engendered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11 I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him the way to solve this problem was through non-violence.
I know his motives were good but he used force and it created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in children ingesting hand sanitizer in last 4 years
Poison control centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400-percent uptick since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 swallowing highly-alcoholic hand sanitizer, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, hand sanitizer ingestion cases in children under 12 that were reported to poison control centers went up from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Kids are getting into these products more frequently, and unfortunately, there's a percentage of them going to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said some kids are drinking sanitizer intentionally, while some do it to impress their friends or on a social-media dare.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking sanitizer for a cheap buzz.
Teens have reportedly mixed sanitizer with alcohol-containing mouthwash for a stiffer drink.
Younger children can be drawn to attractive sanitizer scents.
"A kid is not thinking this is bad for them," Lopez said.
A lot of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are the ones that are scented.
There are strawberry, grape, orange-flavored hand sanitizers that are very appealing to kids.
Hand sanitizer contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, especially, only a few squirts can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison control center at University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave a shot of whiskey sitting around, but people will have these hand sanitizers out and if kids get into it, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested as many as four squirts of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood-alcohol level was .179, twice the threshold considered legally drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah was slurring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma, as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been very lethal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products or sanitizing wipes short of moving hand sanitizer out of a child's reach.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some sanitizers have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizer that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials surmised that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in upstate New York plotted to poison their "mean" teacher "by putting antibacterial products around the classroom," according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from her room.
Police considered the foiled plan to be "idle chatter," referring discipline to the school district.
Rumour Mill: No Celtic disharmony

Hearts to fight SFA over Neilson charge and Warburton wary of January signings disrupting squad unity
Dons stretch lead over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's first-half penalty gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie, allowing the Dons to open up a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays down disharmony talk
It has sparked rumours of disharmony at Celtic, which was dismissed out of hand by Griffiths, who insisted he and his team-mates are not labouring under any sense of increased scrutiny as they prepare to face the Dutch League leaders.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack of Scots title race bores Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and ex-Netherlands international Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there's no title rivalry with Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland, they don't show highlights of the Celtic games any more and why?"
It is because Rangers aren't there.
People here don't only talk about Rangers coming back.
They talk about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's what they are interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games and it is not just people in Scotland who want to see those games.
I'll turn things around, vows Deila
RONNY Deila has accepted Celtic are struggling, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
Defeat to Malmo and subsequent Champions League exit was swiftly followed by losing to 10-man Aberdeen, who now sit five points clear at the top of the table.
But Deila said: "Celtic have had bad periods before and we will come again."
Now we want to come out of it as quickly as possible.
I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
That is the same as we are - but we have to go on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players much better.
To stay together now is so important.
Warburton wary of January transfers
Despite comments just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he had identified some January transfer targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is wary of a signing spree, insisting he doesn't want to disrupt the Ibrox squad's unity.
The ex-Brentford gaffer said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
In terms of players coming in the summer, you have that pre-season period to bed them in, which you've seen with our own group this season.
The squad is doing really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu in retirement hint
Swansea striker Michu, linked with Celtic during the transfer window, has dropped hints that he could retire when his contract with the Swans is up.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with a troublesome ankle for two years, and failed to find a move away from Wales in the summer.
Hearts set for SFA battle over Neilson comments
Hearts were leading 2-1 when Paterson was dismissed and went on to lose 3-2, but the defender's red card was later overturned - the third Collum red card in eight months to be rescinded.
Neilson is sticking with what he said, insisting: "I didn't question any integrity, I didn't comment on a performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The diehard Hibee was carpeted after admitting singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident happened in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before an Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was heat of the moment," the striker said, adding: "Safe to say I won't be going back to Tynecastle unless it is playing for Celtic."
Tannadice board has faith in Dundee United management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists Dundee United's board still has faith in the management team to turn things round - but concedes the on-field decline must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We'll get the boys ready to go again," said Donnelly.
McInnes glad to "win ugly" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits his Aberdeen side had to cling on desperately against Hamilton Accies to see out a seventh successive league win that moved them five points clear of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty.
McInnes said: "There's not a team out there who has won anything, whether it's cups or leagues, who haven't won games like that."
Scots unemployment remains unchanged as UK total rises
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 during the period May to July while the number out of work for the UK as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above the UK's rate of 5.5 per cent, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three month period, with the number of those in work now standing at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell over the quarter at 74.0 per cent - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The government's long term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK.
In those 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish Labour market with employment increasing and unemployment falling.
Why I'm A Witness At An Execution In Oklahoma
Later today, barring a late legal intervention, I will watch a man being put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it won't, I will sit in a viewing gallery in the death chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary as Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was first made back in January, via his best friend, and though I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I've come to dread it.
So why do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
True, journalists are permitted to watch executions in America and because there are often more applications than seats available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five.
Whoever is picked will watch it dispassionately.
I cannot do that.
I will be sitting alongside Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have developed my own relationship with him through months of phone calls, and one visit lasting two-and-a-half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed a notebook and pen to record what I see.
I will just have to try to remember all the details.
One Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the inmate's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have phrased it better," but still thinks I'm wrong to do what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip has taken issue with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I've told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he thinks the publicity will help the anti-death penalty movement.
Kim Bellware, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be alongside me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've made.
I won't go over all the details again here.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being an accessory after the fact.
But I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe his execution is wrong.
And it's from this perspective that I will watch him die.
I cannot claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for that.
What you will get from me is what it's like to watch a man I like die an unnecessary death.
Man coaxed from Canning River after soggy police chase
The Canning Vale constable remained dry as he coaxed the man from the Canning River.
A Perth man's bid to lose a police tail came undone after he found himself in shallow, muddy water just metres from a police officer trying to "coax him gently back to shore."
Canning Vale police were called to a trespassing incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they spotted the suspect he tried to ditch them by heading into the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He was standing in the water saying 'I'm not getting out, 'come and get me'," Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec wasn't too keen on getting his uniform wet, so he employed a safer tactic - "good police negotiation."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try and escape," Senior Sergeant Castledine said.
Champion footballer Ben Cousins provides a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins ditched his car to avoid a booze bus and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but did inspire locals to begin planning a tongue-in-cheek Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody alleges stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to quit racing
Peter Moody has alleged Racing Victoria stewards attempted to plant a spy in his stables last year and threatened to quit racing immediately.
He took aim at stewards and Racing Victoria's integrity department, alleging they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment the final straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media he had always tried to do what is best for racing and has found himself in difficult circumstances when it comes to Lidari's positive swab to cobalt, which he can not explain.
He had bitten his tongue about the spy allegations for 18 months and didn't want it "to look like sour grapes."
"I wasn't going to say anything about that and I have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you get so frustrated it all comes out at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and have to live the consequences and I will have to live with what I said.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.
When they start to think I'm not that's when I shouldn't be a trainer.
I would then have to consider what I do with my licence.
Earlier, Moody had dropped the bombshell in a racing.com interview that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - who I will name if asked - and offered him employment to work in my stables to offer information on what I was doing within my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
They obviously believe I'm a cheat.
If that's the case surely they should all hand in their briefs because they've been incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of that at the time and are aware of that today.
Should that make me think it's becoming personal?
Has RVL got a grow a set of balls and maybe make people outside of trainers responsible for what it is going on the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I am.
Maybe they need to take my licence off me and push me away and I've got no doubt what I'm saying now might make them think about that.
But I've got to the point now where I don't care and that saddens me.
That really saddens me.
I will put the pressure on them and onus on them to make a decision.
I've got the support of my family and I can walk away.
The trainer's frustration levels have built with the long-running cobalt inquiry involving Lidari and the late scratching had him saying that he could "throw my licence across the table."
Moody, best known for preparing unbeaten champion Black Caviar, labelled the race-day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a mud or clay poultice had been applied to the horses legs, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I've got to accept full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my staff mistakenly laced mud on its leg.
It could have had it last night.
It could have had it yesterday, which it did have.
It had it on race day.
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for the race day treatment using the poultice, which stewards have opened an inquiry into.
It is a joke.
People making these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all understand that we need for rules but it has gone too far," Moody said.

Police have arrested a man over a hit-and-run collision with a cyclist in Cobram at the weekend.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being struck by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist drove away without stopping to help the injured rider.
On Monday a 50-year-old Nathalia man handed himself in to police at Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with failing to stop at an accident, failing to render assistance, and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old Cobram man, remains in hospital in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back at rivals over wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his side's tackling as "agenda setting" by the NRL's two premiership favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm to "wrestle" his side during the Storm's upset win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled reference to the Storm after his side's qualifying final win over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called that game a "showcase" of the rugby league and said the two Queensland weren't "too big" into wrestling.
Bellamy defended his side's tackling and said they just focused on their "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added he took confidence from having two leading coaches criticise his side as it meant they were concerned about the Storm beating them.
"That keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson bring up wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee we haven't changed nothing all year with our defensive systems or techniques, it's just that the last six weeks we have made a real emphasis with our contact in tackles and that has been the turn around for us.
Trent has been there three years and he obviously has a great side to coach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting football" reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the premiership in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
Wayne is talking about exciting footy.
He made a point of comparing his game on Saturday night with our one on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticised a lot for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't give a rat's arse.
But now he has a team which can play what we would see as exciting footy, especially his young halves with their speed.
That's the footy you would want to play when you have those sort of players.
He made that point in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of footy - not every team has two halves like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that.
To me it builds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit concerned about playing us.
Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking of us when they get to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out the Storm and Roosters game was a higher scoring contest than the Broncos and Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet but what was the score? 16-12?
Our game it was 20-18, there was two more tries in our game but is that exciting footy?
Or is it making breaks and not scoring tries that is exciting?
To me it's agendas.
If they are mentioning us it means that at some stage we might meet them there.
The Storm have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in next Saturday night's preliminary final at AAMI Park with tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Serbian man gets $200k bail on drug charge
A man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to possess 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smuggled into Queensland has been granted bail on a $200,000 surety.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked 100 kilograms of the drug from the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked at Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting with his co-accused at the marina throughout the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued there was no evidence that he was attempting to possess all of it and that he might have been at the cafe for an innocent purpose.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned Maksimovic was a flight risk.
He has clear connections to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
On the crown case he lied to police about where he was staying.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a surety of $200,000 to secure his release.
"Having read the affidavits of both those persons, it is clear that the imposition of a surety of $200,000 constitutes a real financial burden on them," Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone was insufficient to deter him from failing to appear, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the conditions that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to police on a daily basis and adheres to a 6pm-6am curfew.
Stevan Hogg used girls phone to lure paedophiles to send images
A paedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to solicit child abuse images.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone as she slept then logged into an online messaging service where he had a succession of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in sleeping Hogg's hand.
She looked through it and found the disturbing messages before immediately alerting her mother.
Police attended and saw the five pictures, then analysed computers found at the address and discovered "concerning" web searches using terms for finding indecent image of children.
Hogg then claimed to officers he had done it as it would "lead paedophiles" on the internet before "pretending he was a police officer to scare them."
Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He accepted the searches were made by him on the computer but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare paedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the images and him asking them to send more photos.
He said he was doing it to lure them in.
He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking and said he wants to view rape and murder images.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone she shouted her mother and was shaking and crying.
She saw the indecent images on the phone and the accused was then confronted.
The girl was interviewed and spoke of the accused using the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked way younger than him.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty on indictment to charges of taking or making indecent images of children on June 14 last year, breaching bail on January 25 this year and failing to attend at court for a hearing on March 24 this year.
Defence solicitor Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offenders register as it may be argued there was "no significant sexual element" to his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael deferred sentence until October for social work background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody ahead of hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was placed on the sex offenders register ahead of his sentencing date.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe delivers wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, earlier this year fell down the steps leading from a podium.
He was unhurt, but video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also tarnished by claims by opposition legislators that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against booing Mr Mugabe during his address.
Last month, they booed and heckled him during his state of the nation address in parliament - which is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) chief whip Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt Nr Mugabe's address.
"The message is coming from a number which is not reflecting but it's titled 'death'," he told journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends at parliament and once they step out of parliament that parliamentary immunity does not operate.
The chief whip said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "worried" about the threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard expects to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-saving efforts at it enterprise services business.
HP is splitting into two listed companies later this year, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations.
The expected job cuts will result in a charge of about $2.7bn, beginning in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring activities will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, the HP chairman and chief executive who will head the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we will have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help enterprises transition to the new style of business," said Whitman.
As a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have more than $50bn in annual revenue and "will be focused on delivering unrivaled integrated technology solutions" to companies, according to a company statement.
It breaks up a company formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electric equipment, and whose Palo Alto garage has been dubbed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has been undergoing a massive reorganisation to cope with the move away from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world's second-largest PC maker and one of the biggest US tech firms, is the latest in the sector based on the belief that tightly focused firms perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb tie
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is still only September and, providing his rehabilitation goes to plan, there is no reason why he cannot be back playing by Christmas.
That best-case scenario already means that Wilshere is certain to miss at least the next four England games and, given his history, his involvement in next summer's European Championship is clearly uncertain.
The great shame of this latest problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then looked back to his old sharpness during pre-season.
"This kind of injury is not career-threatening," said Wenger.
It is a bone that did not heal well.
It is nothing major.
This was just an accident.
It was not linked with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.
That might be true from a purely medical perspective but, as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the related danger of further injuries whenever any player tries to return midseason.
There is also an uncomfortable pattern developing.
Research by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different Wilshere ailments since he made his debut six years ago.
He has also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games during the last five seasons.
The wider picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007-08, they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to lose most days through injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle but Arsenal believe that an improvement in their injury record during last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you are coming back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to get over that.
I hope his body stabilises, I am confident it will and he will make a career of the kind he deserves.
With Arsenal beginning their Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger may also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give a little breather to players who need it," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is among Europe's most intimidating.
Dinamo are also unbeaten in 41 matches after producing their own "Invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night by an earth tremor that measured 3.2 on the Richter.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal have learnt the lesson of last season's Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of managing the club to a first European Cup triumph.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It has never been done at Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006 but, on the other hand, I am long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar portrayals in shows is glaring, particularly given how the need for men to open up is more desperate now than ever, with suicide rates amongst young males at 15 year high.
In 2013, it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in males than females.
In a bid to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of the Male, aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship lies at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high-school students displaying depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a high enough percentage of "healthy mood" friends, their chances of recovering doubled.
Equally, for those not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the chances of mental challenges arising.
But of course, for friendship to work, it needs to be accessible in the first place.
In this age of social-media led communication, with its focus on style over substance, immediacy of response is often prioritised over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, fun-loving and successful, even if in reality isolation is king.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists term extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner yearning for personal growth and friendship - that more deeply impacts our mental health.
And as a billionaire video-game creator explained recently, money really doesn't buy greater happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that it turned this focus on its head.
Each of the characters were not defined by their work, but rather their personalities, which shone through the interaction as friends.
The humour of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments watching football on the comfy chairs, and Ross's pining for Rachel, came from the knowledge that yes, men can all relate to this, even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings.
As a Samaritan worker explained to me: ...."my listening role to people feeling depressed and suicidal has really highlighted how even the smallest interactions from friends can make a difference."
Often the men who contact us feel unable to speak to friends.
The old adage of "getting on with it" is strong, as is the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try and offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the little moments of male friendship.
As much as my objective, outsider status over the phone helps people in moments of desperation, the long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friend network.
And so, if you attend Comedy Central's FriendsFest this weekend, with the sets fully redesigned in celebration, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, better still, if in Starbucks you see someone alone, give a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcasting on Comedy Central from start to finish - the full 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores to help PSG swat aside Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut to help PSG ease past Swedish side Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on target as Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2-0 win against Malmo at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut as a PSG player to set the French champions on their way, but they missed a succession of opportunities before finally extending their advantage when Cavani headed home in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as they target not just qualification for the knockout rounds but an improvement on their runs to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a vintage display by Laurent Blanc's side with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasteful in front of goal and later being substituted against his hometown team and the club with whom he started his illustrious career back in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so to win 2-0, cause our opponents problems and look comfortable at the back is a good start even if there are certain things we will need to perfect as the season goes on," said Blanc.
It augurs well.
We wanted to win and we did, although I regret that we did not score one or two goals more.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that had been held to a 2-2 draw at home by Bordeaux in Ligue 1 at the weekend, but he was upstaged in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentina winger was labelled as the man to take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was signed from Manchester United last month, and he indicated why as he ran onto Marco Verratti's pass in behind the Malmo defence before angling a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland and into the far corner of the net.
However, if anyone then expected PSG to romp to a big victory, they were to be disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, lined up with nine full internationals on the field at kick-off and, with a five-man defence and two deep in midfield, were stuffy opponents.
But, save for a Nikola Djurdjic shot that slid just wide of Kevin Trapp's far post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG let themselves down at times with some wasteful passing and poor finishing, not least from Ibrahimovic, who failed to convert no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then let down by his touch having been put in by Cavani just after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more adept when it came to setting up his colleagues, and it was from an Ibrahimovic pass that Di Maria sent in a curling shot which was tipped around the post by Wiland on 52 minutes.
The second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan heading home his sixth of the season after Ibrahimovic had flicked on a left-wing cross from Maxwell.
That ended any ideas that Malmo had of coming back into the game, and only a superb stop by Wiland from point-blank range to deny David Luiz kept the final score down before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi had a goal disallowed right at the death.
Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted PSG were a class above his side, the Norwegian saying: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league which is not the same level.
The qualifiers are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was a magnificent match from them.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in share sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, hit by collapsing commodities prices, on Wednesday raised $2.5 billion via a shares sale as part of its vast debt-slashing plan.
London-listed Glencore said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay down debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is grappling with tumbling commodity prices as China's economic slowdown weighs on demand and sparks havoc across markets.
The rights issue sent Glencore's share price soaring to the top of the London stock market in early morning deals on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had last week revealed the $2.5-billion shares sale as part of broader plans to slash its $30 billion debt pile by about a third.
The company sold the new stock at 125 pence per share, which marked a 2.4-percent discount to the closing price on Tuesday.
It offloaded 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns over prolonged stalled Chinese growth have slashed iron ore prices by roughly a half, as coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
White House Confirms Xi Jinping's Washington Visit
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the U.S. at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official one to Washington, will take place on Sept. 25 and reciprocates President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner that evening, after the two leaders have engaged in bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will present an opportunity to expand U.S.-China cooperation on a range of global, regional, and bilateral issues of mutual interest, while also enabling President Obama and President Xi to address areas of disagreement constructively," the statement added.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle to meet several U.S. tech leaders on his way to Washington, before going on to New York City for the U.N. General Assembly on Sept.
Obama and Xi are expected to broach a range of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns over China's alleged cyberespionage and its increasing assertiveness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis shattered the Schengen Zone
The distress flare let off by Germany didn't unite the European crew, but is now forcing the ship to change course, writes French daily Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal with the refugee issue in advance: now it will systematically classify migrants and asylum-seekers as soon as they set foot on the old continent, especially in Greece, in order to prevent arguments about the future division of refugees according to quotas based on numbers that are ever-further removed from reality.
Six days after President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU Member States to distribute 160 thousand refugees among themselves, the foreign ministers of Member States changed their priorities.
Rather than worry about refugees' final destination, it was now necessary to filter those arriving now and resolve the fate of those who are already inside the Schengen Zone.
"The effective management of the EU's external borders is essential in order to manage migration," emphasised the ministers in the text discussed in Brussels on Monday.
After the shared currency crisis the EU is now finding that its other major integration project is under threat.
While it may have been taken by surprise, Germany is not losing its resolve and is increasing the pressure.
It is renewing border controls, especially those with Austria, without blocking the entry of those seeking asylum in the country.
The central power in Europe is thus showing that no free movement is possible in Europe without it.
As evidence of this, Austria and Slovakia imposed the same measures on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering them, albeit with varying levels of intensity.
Hungary imposed such measures long ago.
These exceptional, temporary measures are permitted by the rules of the Schengen Zone.
However, even a blind man can see that this is a domino effect.
A key question for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and Hungary for those who have already entered the interior.
Intensive negotiations about this took place between French Minister of the Interior Bernard Cazeneuve and his German counterpart Thomas de Maizière during a private discussion with their colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
While this idea is not a new one, its realisation is difficult.
According to unofficial statistics, two thirds of newly-arrived refugees have already been registered and identified, including the taking of fingerprints.
Budapest refuses to set up any entry point on its territory as it fears more than the others that it would have to deal with camps at which refugees would gather at its expense.
The real black hole in the matter remains Greece.
This year more than 200 thousand people have this year landed on its islands along the Turkish coast, twice the number that have recently arrived in Italy.
The majority of these are genuine asylum seekers who have come directly from Syria after passing through the overflowing camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It is an enormous, gaping hole.
Athens, which is still enduring financial collapse, has taken a back seat.
It is the starting-point for the Balkan route and a source of now joint concern for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian premier Viktor Orbán.
Juncker's Commission promises to introduce control points as soon as possible, without stating a number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece affect the whole of Europe," agreed the EU's interior ministers on Monday on the issue of mobilisation in this regard.
The goal is to place intervention teams from the European border control agency Frontex within the country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity for the receipt of asylum-seekers and reinforce surveillance of the islands.
"Appropriate funds will be required," warns the text submitted to ministers for approval.
From a legal point of view, Athens will continue to have the final say.
The issue of the creation of true European border controls was not officially raised, although Europe is heading towards them.
In any event, the new emergency faced by the twenty-eight Member States has pushed the issue of mandatory quotas and the 160 thousand refugees, proposed by Juncker's Commission and the European Parliament at the start of the year and given strong support by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande, to the sidelines.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still refuse to entertain the idea
as they regard it as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number of refugees, but not the obligation to accept them, was retained in the text approved on Monday by the majority of Member States.
It was, however, retained as a political undertaking.
In other words, the process has been suspended.
The sole firm promise is for the redistribution of 40 thousand refugees within the next two years, which had already been agreed during the hectic EU summit in June, concludes Le Figaro.
Seven dead in avalanche in the Alps, incl. three Czechs - reports.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among seven tourists killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, the sole survivor from the eight-person group was a woman from Germany.
Previous media reports had stated that she was Polish.
The woman, aged around thirty, was admitted to hospital in the town of Briancon with a serious injury to the thigh-bone area.
According to AFP the dead were primarily in their forties.
"The rescue mission has now ended and the bodies of the victims have been taken to Briancon for identification," stated Pierre Besnard, prefect of the departement Hautes-Alpes.
The accident occurred around noon in the mountainous Pelvoux region below the peak of the 4,015 metre-high Dôme de Neige des Ecrins.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 metres wide and about a metre high," said the head of the rescue team, Nicolas Colombani.
The eight-person group was hit by a massive quantity of snow at a height of about 3,900 metres, he continued.
The meteorological service today warned of unfavourable weather conditions in the region.
Trpišovský ahead of Braga game: Finally the real Europe
On his European debut, Liberec coach Jindřich Trpišovský got through the Europa League qualifying rounds to reach the group stages and is now looking forward to experiencing real European competition with the team.
In the first match in the main phase of the competition, Liberec host 2011 finalists Braga, on whom they want to, according to the coach, impose their playing style.
After all the nerves in the knock-out games on your way to the group stages, where every goal and every situation could knock you out, we're here now and we'll play six matches.
Obviously we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every goal we concede, we can play to our tactics and we're not bound by a normal knock-out tie.
"I'm really looking forward to it and it's real European competition - before it was just qualification," said Trpišovský at the press conference.
He considers Braga a top team.
They'll be very active and all their players are Brazilian, Portuguese or Spanish and good on the ball.
Our opponents will probably be all the more difficult because they don't have any big names in their squad, but they have a player who scored three goals against Manchester United I think.
"They're an excellent team, one of the top teams," stated Trpišovský.
However, he doesn't consider Braga the clear favourite.
The way I see it, we're playing at home, so we're definitely not underdogs.
"I think that we've showed, both in the league and in the qualifying rounds, that we are strong at home, and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team has lost only the season-opening Supercup against Plzeň out of its eleven games this season.
He believes that Liberec will be able to impose its playing style on Braga, too.
We'll be playing a team that will be strong on the ball, while being at the same time, for them, almost atypically disciplined.
They play a 4-4-2 system with a rapid transition to attack.
"They're very hard opponents. We did discover some weaknesses, but the most important thing will be what our players do on the pitch," said Trpišovský.
In the qualifying rounds we studied our opponents a lot, which helped us a lot, and this time we want to focus on our game, to which we've adapted our training.
"And we definitely want the game to be played on our terms, even though it'll be very demanding," he added.
Student films take over Písek; start of international festival.
Over 351 authors from 51 countries have entered their works into this year's 15th edition of the International Student Film Festival in Písek.
The forty films selected for the final by the jury, composed of students and teachers, will be screened in the Portyč cinema from 15 to 18 October.
The best of these will be chosen by an international jury, says festival spokesman Jakub Charvát.
Every year the festival has its own theme, based on the festival's theme tune.
This year the theme is detective stories.
The director of this year's gala evenings, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre in them.
"And obviously we have to solve the crime that was committed in this year's trailer," says Charvát.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting student films - live-action, animated and documentaries.
Films will be judged by an international jury including, for example, last year's winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
As with every year, the festival will include a supporting programme of events.
Visitors will be able to see Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ondřej Smeykal, turbochanson group Poletíme?, playful group Zrní and Petra Hapková with a recital of "Život na baru".
The festival will also include two photography exhibitions.
The first will feature Jana Ašenbrennerová, a graduate of the Písek film school and winner of prestigious awards, including World Press Photo 2014.
The second exhibition will convey the atmosphere in Nepal following the tragic earthquake.
There will be a talk with visitors featuring cameraman and documentary film-maker Martin Čech, the silent film "The Cameraman" will be accompanied by the music of Gerhard Gruber and Písek natives Brukner, Novotný and Hlack will launch their new book "3 kamarádi z města P" ('3 friends from the town of P.') in the studio of sculptor Jan Novotný.
This year we will also remember Miroslav Ondříček, patron of the Miroslav Ondříček Film Academy (FAMO) in Písek, who recently passed away.
Our school and festival are his ongoing legacy.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to gather here, share their experiences among each other and develop their mutual ties and the craft of film," said the spokesman.
This process will also be aided by the Pitching forum, where students will be able to meet film professionals, take part in several work auditions at once and get work.
The festival is associated with the creation of the Private College of Film-making in Písek.
Its founders, Vladana and Miloň Terč, organised the first edition in 1997.
Up until the sixth edition it took place once every two years.
Insurance companies to meet client claims in full if travel agencies go bankrupt.
Insurance companies are to meet client claims to their full amount in the event of travel agencies going bankrupt,
following a decision taken on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies, which has passed a modified amendment to the act on conditions for doing business in the tourism industry.
According to the document which now goes to the Senate for evaluation, travel agencies will be able to replace insurance against bankruptcy with a bank guarantee.
Insurance companies disagree with the obligation to meet client claims even above the agreed limit.
The Ministry for Regional Development continues to insist upon the amendment, arguing in terms of consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to stop insuring travel agencies if the amendment is passed.
However, the proposal is facing criticism from travel agencies, too,
as without insurance they will have to either close or go abroad.
Minister for Regional Development Karla Karla Šlechtová (ANO) pointed out that cases where insurance companies do not meet claims in full go against European law,
and highlighted this year's ruling by the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that clients are entitled to receive full refunds irrespective of insurance limit.
Šlechtová emphasised that insurance companies would receive sufficient information on the running of travel agencies and would be able to set the correct limit.
"While we appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, it must have such a limit as to be feasible," countered TOP 09 deputy chairman Miroslav Kalousek.
Kalousek claims that bank guarantees won't work as no-one will give unlimited guarantees.
"Travel agencies will have to either close down or move abroad," he warned.
Based on a survey of member travel agencies, member of the presidium of the Association of Travel Agencies and Tour Operators of the Czech Republic Tomio Okamura did not agree with Kalousek's fears.
"Stop lobbying for the insurance companies," he said.
Okamura does not consider the insurance companies' statement to be relevant, and according to him, no such written, official statement to this effect exists.
They will, however, determine whether travel agencies will be able to make some contribution, which would not, according to Okamura, be a problem.
Also warning against the provision was Jana Fischerová (ODS), who highlighted the point of view of the competing Association of Czech Travel Agents, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who talked of pulling the rug from under travel agencies' feet.
According to Fischerová, travel agencies would not be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection works," judges Fischerová.
Her proposal to delete the disputed passage was not passed by the Chamber of Deputies.
Also unsuccessful was Vojtěch Filip (KSČM), whose proposal to return the document to the committee stage due to an alleged conflict with the Civil Code did not pass, either.
Filip highlighted the tour operators, who he said could threaten the consumer.
Following the ruling of the Constitutional Court, Martina Berdychová (ANO), who tabled the motion, withdrew her proposal, which would limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not know that premiums did not cover the entire risk.
The amendment will not contain the originally proposed minimum four-million crown insurance limit for travel agencies offering tours using air travel, or the million-crown limit for agencies selling e.g. coach tours.
The limit will remain at 30 percent of planned takings from the sale of tours.
However, the insurance limit will have to be such that travel agencies can cover the entirety of clients' claims in the event of bankruptcy.
Even after these modifications the law will require that tour operators now state which travel agency is organising tours that have been sold.
Before agreeing an insurance policy, travel agencies will have to submit to insurance companies data on their economic management and number tours, among other data.
The approved amendatory proposal by the public administration also anticipates the giving of further information to insurance companies.
Every month travel agencies will have to submit data on the number of travellers and tours sold, the total price of tours sold and the amount of deposits and takings from tours and vouchers.
Should the Ministry of Regional Development find that a travel agency has not met a legal obligation towards an insurance company, it will, according to the proposal, request that the agency remedy the situation or will be permitted to bar it from agreeing new contracts in the event that such a breach of its obligations could threaten the interests of customers.
The amendment is also to address the funding of the mountain rescue service.
The Ministry of Regional Development will determine the level of subsidy provided to the mountain rescue service based on the service's application for the next year's funding, which is to be submitted by the end of April.
The application will contain a report on the use made of state funds in the previous year, a financial expenditure plan and the outlook over the next two years.
However, according to the association the submitter did not take into account the situation that would arise if an insurance company terminated a contract with a travel agency.
The agency would then not be able to organise tours and clients who had bought tours prior to the termination of the contract would, according to the Association, lose their tours.
In such a case, the travel agency would suffer a significant loss and may even go bust, even if its finances were in good condition.
One of the options for travel agencies to cope with such a situation would be to pursue claims for damages against the state.
Another option would be to leave the Czech Republic and enjoy the much less stringent conditions abroad, while only operating in the Czech Republic as agencies, says Association deputy chairman Jan Papež.
While the draft amendment also incorporates bank guarantees, the idea is so badly thought-out that it would not be feasible in practice as bank guarantees cannot be given for unlimited amounts.
Furthermore, according to the Association a change in current practice is effectively superfluous.
Due to a new EU Directive the law will have to be revised within a period of two years.
A total of 942 active, insured travel agencies are currently active on the Czech market.
This year only three travel agencies closed down.
Every year Czech travel agencies sell tours to a total value of twenty billion crowns.
Merkel: We must improve conditions in the Middle East
The European Union must promote the improvement of humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon to reduce the number of refugees coming to Europe.
This was contained in a statement by Angela Merkel following discussions with German state premiers.
At the same time she again appealed for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU among member states.
We must give more assistance to the countries from which refugees are coming or in which they stay when they leave their home country.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we promote dignified conditions in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Lebanon, said the German Chancellor, according to whom such a signal could be increased financial aid or closer cooperation between the EU and humanitarian organisations.
"The German States also support the German government in promoting the fair distribution of the burden of the refugee crisis among the countries of Europe," stated Merkel.
In relation to this, Brandenburg prime minister Dietmar Woidke stated at the press conference that he expected true solidarity from all EU member states.
The Czech Republic, among others, is one of the countries that has, for some time now, rejected the quota-based distribution of refugees.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke in favour of the acceleration of asylum proceedings in Germany.
People must know as soon as possible whether they have a chance to stay here.
This is also required by the authorities so that they can start with the integration of foreigners earlier, said the Brandenburg premier.
According to Woidke it is also necessary for the majority of money spent by Germany ion care for refugees to be put towards the integration of those who have a chance of gaining asylum.
More teachers will be required to teach refugees German.
It is a considerable challenge for my country, but I believe that, if we are successful in integrating refugees, then they can be an asset to us, he said.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity saying it wasn't needed behind the scenes.
During Sunday night's episode of HBO's Project Greenlight, the seasoned actor cut Brown off while she was emphasizing the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black protagonist in the project's chosen screenplay.
"When we're talking about diversity you do it in the casting of the film not in the casting of the show," Damon asserted.
Shocked, Brown reacted with offended disbelief, letting out "Hoo! Wow. Okay," as The Martian actor's comments settled in the air.
Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I would urge people to think about -- whoever the director is, how they're going to treat the character of Harmony," Brown initially said.
The only black character who's a hooker who gets hit by her white pimp.
The Dear White People producer pushed for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon retorted their directing could "end up giving us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disapproval over Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger toward the clip writing, "Matt Damon speaking over the only black person in the room so he can explain diversity to her is SO WHITE it hurts."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since being posted.
Damon's comments come at a time where accurate racial representation in media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took nationwide effect, urging lawmakers and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince alluded to the movement while introducing the nominees of Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question of whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," leaders said.
Damon was recently announced as one of a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church's portrayal in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Pro-rock climber and busboy Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win American Ninja Warrior Monday night taking home the $1 million grand prize.
The competition show, which just wrapped up its 7th season, has never seen any competitor complete all stages of its obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
The final task involved climbing a 75-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten went first completing the challenge on time, making him the first-ever athlete to complete American Ninja Warrior's grueling stage 4, however, Caldiero finished the challenge a full three seconds faster making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke with E!News after the hard-fought victory, still in shock about winning the $1 million grand prize.
"I mean it's amazing to think about, like I've never made or lived off more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! of his serious pay-bump.
So to all of a sudden...like I can't even imagine what it's going to be like...the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why, despite Britten being the first ever competitor to finish the course, won't be awarded any prize money.
By the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there's more than one finisher, the one with the fastest time gets it," said Weed.
As much as the money is a wonderful prize and life changing, he does get the great gratification.
I don't think he harbors any ill will about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he's done.
He's received tons of accolades from fans.
He's such a great guy, and a family man.
He's a hero to his kids and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I was going to be beat by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they roles were reversed.
America Ninja Warrior was renewed for an eighth season, which will begin filming in Spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers tiptoe past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half the season hasn't been a lot of fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Once one of the best teams in baseball, the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Central.
Reducing to being a spoiler, the Tigers played the part perfectly Tuesday, beating the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins squandered a chance to climb to within one-half game of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild-card spot.
For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three-letter F-word that has been so elusive over much of the season's second half.
"All wins are fun, no matter how it happens," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon made his early offensive support hold up, as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then tacked one in the sixth and one more in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third quality start in his past nine outings.
"I just want to finish strong this year," Simon said.
It's hard for the bullpen to throw every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers designated hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and drove in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit night since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good in (batting practice), looked noticeably better in BP, and he carried it right into the game.
Trailing by three runs in the bottom of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center fielder Byron Buxton led off the inning with a double down the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks reached on a bunt single, and Simon got second baseman Brian Dozier to strike out swinging before being lifted for left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only man he faced, ahead of rookie designated hitter Miguel Sano, who ripped a two-run single to left off right-hander Drew VerHagen.
With a pair of runners on and the tying run at second, VerHagen got third baseman Trevor Plouffe to ground into a double play.
It was the major-league-leading 27th time this season that Plouffe hit into a DP.
After Detroit tacked on an insurance run in the top of the ninth, Mauer ripped an RBI double to the gap against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon to make it 5-4.
However, the right-hander struck out Sano on three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of a rusty Phil Hughes in the early going.
The Tigers posted three runs in the first two innings against the veteran right-hander, who came off the disabled list before the game after missing more than a month because of lower back inflammation.
"Obviously not the start I'd like to have," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable as I went along and felt I was able to execute some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After getting the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk to right fielder J.D. Martinez brought up Victor Martinez, who singled up the middle for the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez snapped his 0-for-21 streak with runners in scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single to right, scoring another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out trying to advance to third, ending the threat.
The Tigers added on in the second, getting a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose to make it 3-0.
"That was a big hit," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit it particularly well, but he got it in the right spot.
Hughes, who was on a pitch count, pitched a scoreless third inning before being replaced by right-handed reliever A.J. Achter.
Hughes was charged with three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was shut down with a strain in his throwing shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed surgery on Sanchez's shoulder back in 2007.
Sanchez, on the disabled list with a shoulder strain since mid-August, was scheduled to be activated for a Wednesday start.
With Sanchez out, LHP Daniel Norris will come off the DL to start against the Twins.
Norris is 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in a trade for LHP David Price on July 30.
He has been out since Aug. 20 with a strained right oblique.
The Tigers and Twins will wrap up their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will oppose Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi urges to open economy wider to world
The economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with steering reform on Tuesday.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise, and improve opening-up policies," he said, addressing the 16th Meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting opening up while pushing forward reforms will add new impetus and vitality, and provide new room for economic growth, Xi said.
The leading group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list regulating market access, relaxation of border-control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises (SOE) to absorb private capital and overhauling the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list, identifying sectors and businesses that are off-limits for investment, will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through trial programs.
The move is significant as it will give the market a bigger role in allocating resources, ensuring a law-based business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers it delegates to companies, making sure that companies decide how to run their businesses.
The statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
In a bid to open up state-controlled sectors, more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment, and will protect the lawful interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.
In addition, it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permits, or "green card," by optimizing requirements and streamlining the application process.
Guaranteeing lawyers' right to practice and nurturing professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang, and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement released after the meeting.
More hospital beds possible in Karlovy Vary Region
According to deputy governor of the Karlovy Vary Region Jakub Pánik (ČSSD), the current bed capacity of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial modifications should be implemented on the basis of agreements between the departments of individual hospitals.
However, in the region there are options for expanding the care offered.
For example, single-day surgery centres for the performance of procedures not requiring hospital stays of longer than 24 hours could be set up in surgical units.
It is not yet clear in which specific hospitals single-day surgery centres could be set up.
The skin department of Karlovy Vary Hospital could see the creation of a laser centre with the option of using laser technology to treat skin disease.
The concept also recommended the setup of an apallic centre for the treatment of patients with brain disease who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre would be centrally managed and should form an integral part of the Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation department.
There is also the option of concentrating such a facility at Ostrov Hospital, where a similar facility already exists.
A further area where capacity seems insufficient are the after-care wards, and chiefly the Long-term Care Clinics (LCC) in Nejdek, whose capacity is insufficient and should primarily connect with acute care wards.
The concept recommends that part of this facility function as a rehabilitation ward and part as a classic LCC ward.
As it notes, after-care wards are chiefly absent in Karlovy Vary Hospital,
where buildings left empty following centralisation could be used.
Last but not least, the Karlovy Vary Region lacks social care wards focusing on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
As there is a lack of such wards across the whole country, it could also serve other regions as an 'Alzheimer centre'.
According to the recommendations, hospitals should prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up wards that would be funded through European subsidies.
"These are beds that would follow on from super-specialised medical care fields and create space for the transfer of patients following, for example, a cardiological, neurological, transplantation or other procedure," states the regional concept for care wards.
New services could also be offered in psychiatric care.
