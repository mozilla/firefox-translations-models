Father Józef Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He is charismatic.
At Mass celebrated by him, St. Crowds flock to deliverance and healing.
He was a teenager when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.
Today, through the Franciscan, others experience it.
The Holy Mass celebrated by Father Witko Crowds flock to deliverance and healing
Once, the parents of a 7-month-old child who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart came to him.
It was supposed to be operated on.
Father Józef Witko prayed over him.
The same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.
The astonished doctors said: &quot;Operation is not needed, the defect is only 1.5 mm.&quot;
Parents cried with happiness.
After another prayer of the Franciscan, the hole disappeared completely.
The priest began to experience the unusual actions of the Creator as a teenager.
In his dreams, souls in purgatory came to him asking for help.
I was woken up at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who were dying at the moment,” he recalls.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits a mortal sin.
“My body started to change.
I lost my human features and started to look like an animal,” he says.
An invisible force lifted him up, unable to utter a voice.
He felt lost.
Then God showed him help.
&quot;Immersed in the waters of the river symbolizing holy baptism, I was freed and returned to human form...&quot;, he says.
He told no one about these strange experiences.
A vocation was ripening in him.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
In his sermons, he wanted to talk about more than just Jesus.
He wanted people to experience Him alive.
Members of the charismatic community of Renewal in the Holy Spirit
Many people who hope to get rid of the disease participate in healing masses celebrated by Father Witko.
The priest emphasizes, however, that their main goal is spiritual healing, not bodily.
Kolping&#39;s first defeat FRAC Jarosław
Today (September 26 this year) the Kolpinga FRAC team deservedly lost to the current Polish champion Dartom Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd round of the LOTTO Table Tennis Superleague.
The Jarosławians in such a personal composition, which they presented with the Grodzisk inhabitants, have little chance of winning against the sovereigns of the league.
This was clearly demonstrated by the duel with Dartom Bogoria.
Chen Jingqi, hailed as team leader, is still missing from the team.
Perhaps with him in the squad, the Jarosław team would win a third consecutive triumph in the new season.
The young Asian Qiyao Han probably has not yet grown up to win with such big names as the Greek Panagiotis Gionis or the Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, Marek Badowski.
The competitor from Hellas was the biggest star of the duel in the MOSiR hall at ul. Sikorski in Jarosław.
Against both Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei, he was in a class of his own.
After three duels Kolping FRAC was leading 2:1.
Kou Lei confidently beat Marek Badowski, and Daniel Górak after an exciting, five-set fight - Pavel Siruck.
But then it got worse.
Gionis didn&#39;t give Leia a chance.
There was still hope for a two-point win, but Qiyao Han fell short of Badowski.
There will be no additional tests for seniors.
Why?
As announced by Rafał Trzaskowski, a program of free preventive examinations for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not been approved by the Ministry of Health and its subordinate Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Tariffs.
In the justification, the agency explained that the target group was wrongly selected.
&quot;The above actions may even affect the detection of individual disease entities, which may contribute to the deepening of difficulties in accessing NHF services and have a negative impact on the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort related to false positive test results,&quot; it was written.
The president of the capital does not understand the decision of the ministry.
“The money is ours, we have provided the money for it.
Only the government is afraid that if people get tested, they will go to the doctor later, which is absurd, because the point is to lead to a situation in which prophylaxis can be performed faster.
All specialists know that it helps in terms of the burden on the health system, because it helps in detecting diseases quickly and in a reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand,” said Rafał Trzaskowski.
&quot;It&#39;s hard for me to imagine that expert specialists say: Let&#39;s not get tested, because there will be longer queues at the doctor&#39;s office, and if such specialists advise the government, I&#39;m not surprised that the health service is in such a state,&quot; added the PO politician.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all existing agreements
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas told the UN General Assembly on Thursday that he would sever all agreements with Israel if the country&#39;s future government tries to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu&#39;s promise to annex the occupied Palestinian lands.
&quot;If the future government of Israel that comes into existence proceeds to implement this plan, we will annul all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made,&quot; he announced.
&quot;We will totally and completely reject the whole plan,&quot; Abbas threatened emphatically.
&quot;It is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible means - no matter what the consequences are - committing ourselves fully to the application of international law and the fight against terrorism,&quot; declared the Palestinian Authority president, who had already made similar declarations in July.
Netanyahu, Israel&#39;s former prime minister, was again tasked with forming a government after the September 17 elections.
A week before the elections, he announced that if he won, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intended to incorporate all Jewish settlements in the entire West Bank into Israel.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, then led by Yasser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements sponsored by the United States.
Abbas, 84, also promised to hold general elections on Palestinian lands during a session of the UN General Assembly.
The last one took place in 2006.
&quot;When I return to my country, I will call local elections in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, and all who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community,&quot; the Palestinian president solemnly declared.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the UN, to exercise the powers vested in &quot;full members of the UN and all its organs and institutions.&quot;
The Palestinian leader concluded his speech by calling on the international community to &quot;force Israel to comply with the provisions of the United Nations with all due respect.&quot;
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas&#39;s speech, declaring that the Palestinian leader &quot;prefers to focus at the UN on the Palestinian Authority&#39;s efforts against Israel, rather than fight calls for terrorism in the PA under his leadership.&quot;
Danon, however, as noted by the agencies, did not refer to Netanyahu&#39;s announced annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands.
Rescuers want defibrillators in sensitive points in Przemyśl
A story from a border crossing shows that an AED can save lives.
The Provincial Ambulance Station in Przemyśl wants such devices to be located in critical points of the city.
For their attitude, the officers received congratulatory diplomas from the Provincial Ambulance Station in Przemyśl.
Trainee Daniel Cyrnek, senior trainee Grzegorz Bal and commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officers of the Podkarpackie Customs and Tax Office in Przemyśl.
On August 28, they were on duty at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medyka. An officer of the Customs and Tax Service noticed an unconscious man lying in the pedestrian zone.
A Chinese activist died in detention after being tortured.
He wanted to take advantage of the rights guaranteed by the constitution
Cao Shuxia, the activist&#39;s wife, was called on September 23 by the communist party secretary from her home village to say that her husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
What was the cause of death, he did not disclose.
At the morgue, Cao saw her husband&#39;s body mangled, unrecognizable.
“His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were covered in blood,” says the woman.
&quot;They wouldn&#39;t let me take my cell phone with me, and there were a lot of policemen around who wouldn&#39;t let Wang get close.&quot;
The police pressured her to sign a statement that her husband had been seriously ill and had died as a result of an &quot;accident&quot;.
PLN 105 million for video game companies from the National Center for Research and Development
Almost PLN 105 million in funding will go to companies from the gaming industry that create innovative solutions.
On Friday, the National Center for Research and Development announced the results of the third edition of the GameINN program.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the National Center for Research and Development, there are e.g. development of a platform for creating field games based on an AR game engine that creates a map of the real world together with an application that allows users to send data; a test and training platform for verifying practical skills at the workplace and professional development using VR and AI technologies; an innovative game simulating the management of real production processes using an innovative gameplay model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real world using the concept of industry 4.0, according to the NCBR release sent on Friday to PAP.
The aim of the GameINN sectoral program is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish sector of video game producers on the global market until 2023.
According to the National Center for Research and Development, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10%. annually.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, and the forecast for 2019 is PLN 2.23 billion.
“The specially prepared research agenda of GameINN and the support for entrepreneurs, already reaching PLN 300 million, under this sectoral program are an important impulse for further, dynamic growth of Polish gamedev,” we read in the release.
The video games industry is an excellent example of effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
“The incentives introduced by the government for entrepreneurs who focus on innovation, such as R&amp;D relief, competence improvement programs, IP box or support programs implemented by the National Center for Research and Development, drive the innovative activity of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in a very competitive market,” assesses the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister Jarosław Gowin, head of science and higher education, quoted in the release.
The head of the Ministry of Science points out that the money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of project co-financing, but also stays in their pockets - in 2018, three quarters more entrepreneurs took advantage of the R&amp;D relief than the year before.
“The amount of deducted costs related to R&amp;D activity amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in over PLN 300 million in savings for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the National Center for Research and Development in three editions of GameINN,” emphasizes the Deputy Prime Minister.
Director of the National Center for Research and Development, Dr. Eng. Wojciech Kamieniecki reminds that in the two previous competitions, co-financing with a total value of over PLN 211.2 million was awarded to 78 innovative projects.
The huge interest in the 3rd competition and the variety of submitted applications show that the video games industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
“It is especially pleasing that among the selected projects – as in previous editions – there are projects concerning solutions not only for entertainment, but also related to industry 4.0”, he adds.
Entrepreneurs, consortia of entrepreneurs and consortia of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding of up to PLN 20 million in the third GameINN competition.
The NCRD received 87 applications for a total amount of funding of approx. PLN 317 million.
The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were awarded almost PLN 105 million in co-financing.
Detailed information on the results of the 3rd GameINN competition is available at ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sectoral program is implemented as part of the Smart Growth Operational Program.
The NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated in the Polish Games Agreement, which includes, among others, companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team or 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga pleaded guilty to stealing Kasper Dolberg&#39;s watch
The incident happened on September 16.
Dolberg, who moved from Ajax Amsterdam to Nice at the end of August, realized after training that his watch was missing from the locker room.
Not just any, because it&#39;s worth 70,000 euros.
The furious Dane didn&#39;t show up for class the next day, citing stomach problems.
The case was a mystery from the beginning.
Players in the locker room have private safes at their disposal, and the club area is monitored.
According to the AFP agency, Diaby-Fadiga finally confessed to the theft.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised the Dane to return the money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising players of the young generation in France.
He joined Nice at the age of thirteen, and three years later made his debut for the first team.
He has appeared in seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but the newspaper L&#39;Equipe reported that the club is likely to terminate it with immediate effect.
For the time being, he initiated disciplinary proceedings against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on the matter.
Make sure you wash your hands properly
We all know that they need to be washed (e.g. after coming home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that to actually get rid of germs, you have to do it the right way.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds for washing to sufficiently remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands
And yet most of us wash them less!
All you need is warm water and ordinary soap - it&#39;s not true that it has to be antibacterial (many doctors even advise against it).
When washing, we rub not only the bottoms and tops of the hands, but also: fingertips (joined or individually) - rub them with circular movements on the inside of the other hand, spaces between the fingers (interlace hands, rubbing fingers against each other), thumbs - each thumb is covered with the other hand and in such an embrace we turn it to the right and left for a moment.
In an emergency (when you cannot wash your hands), you should wipe your hands with a wet tissue and then use an antibacterial gel (in drugstores, from PLN 5).
After using a public toilet, do not touch door handles or doors with clean hands (recommendation of the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open them with a paper towel.
Iranian President Says He Rejected U.S. Talks, Donald Trump Denies
Tehran did not start talks with the American side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the American offer to lift sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday.
US President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that asked for the lifting of restrictions, which he did not agree to.
According to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the Americans have offered to lift all sanctions on Tehran in exchange for negotiations on a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran&#39;s nuclear program and its ballistic missile program.
Rouhani: Iran will not enter talks under maximum pressure
Iran&#39;s president said he refused to hold the talks because of the &quot;toxic atmosphere&quot;.
He stated that he met with American diplomats because he had succumbed to the urgings of France, Germany and Great Britain.
He stressed, however, that Iran would not enter into talks in an atmosphere of &quot;maximum pressure&quot;.
&quot;And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in a 5+1 format, no one can predict what the end result will be,&quot; Rouhani said.
The day before, the Iranian leader said that he did not rule out talks with the US, and accused the European parties to the nuclear deal of favoring US sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal &quot;are a precondition that does not allow&quot; dialogue to be established.
If we can lift that precondition and if America lifts the sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America,&quot; he declared.
He added that he did not rule out a meeting with US President Donald Trump, despite the fact that he did not agree to such a conversation last week during the UN General Assembly.
Trump: &#39;Iran asked, I said no&#39;
Donald Trump tweeted that he was the one who rejected the request from the Iranian side.
“Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions on them so we could meet.
Of course I said &quot;no!&quot; tweeted the US president.
Tension with a nuclear deal in the background
France, Germany and the UK are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran in order to salvage the 2015 Iran deal they were signatories to in some form.
It stated that in return for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons program and submit its nuclear sector to the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the U.S. withdrawal from the agreement in May 2015, the remaining signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in force.
So far nothing has come of it.
Washington uses maximum pressure tactics on Iran, and the sanctions include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has announced that if it does not receive permission to export the oil, it will reduce its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.

A judge of the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of the hater Emilia, who - according to her words and screenshots from WhatsApp - participated in stalking against judges, was reinstated by the Supreme Administrative Court on Wednesday.
Reason: no disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against him, so there is no basis to uphold the order of the President of the Provincial Administrative Court, Wojciech Mazur, to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, the disciplinary prosecutor at the Supreme Administrative Court, initiated an investigation against Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not yet turned into proceedings against him.
Even though the Supreme Administrative Court, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must deal with the decision of the president of the Provincial Administrative Court within one month of its issuance.
In this situation, the judge who publicly talked about his wife&#39;s mental problems in order to discredit her, who was removed from the KRS office due to suspicions of participating in a hate group, will return to adjudication and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Szmydt denies his involvement in the hate group.
He claims that there is no evidence of this except for faked screenshots and the words of his wife, with whom he is divorcing.
The other judges associated with the &quot;Caste&quot; say exactly the same thing: they are all innocent, there is no evidence.
And it&#39;s quite possible that they&#39;ll get their way.
Because the prosecutor&#39;s office did not lift a finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, it is also silent about the content of Emilia Szmydt&#39;s phone, which she stopped in June in another case.
The police did not lift a finger to secure the devices of the people whom Judge Waldemar Żurek indicated as persecutors in the February report.
There is no evidence - no case of Szmydt, no case of &quot;Kasty&quot;.
There is also no case of the head of NIK, Marian Banaś, about renting a tenement house to pimps and hiding his income.
The CBA checks his asset declarations.
And he will check when he checks.
And the Deputies&#39; Ethics Committee will not deal with Banaś, because the Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Committee somehow got together to make a bizarre decision to dismiss Banaś&#39;s deputies and appoint him as his lawyer, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, probably an American one, about a wife coming home to find her husband in bed with his mistress.
She is so amazed and devastated that she can&#39;t utter a word.
She stands speechless in the doorway, while her mistress quickly jumps out of bed, dresses and leaves.
And the husband makes the bed.
When the wife regains her voice and screams: what is this?
Who is this woman?
The husband calmly asks: what kind of woman, dear?
Only the case of &quot;Kasta&quot; or Banaś is a parody of the state.
And it&#39;s not funny at all.

Kamila Lićwinko in the high jump final
Earlier this season, the competitor, the bronze medalist of the world championships in London 2017, returning to competition this season after a maternity break, beat 1.85 and 1.89 in the first attempt and 1.92 in the second.
She managed to get 1.94 only in the third attempt.
&quot;I&#39;m glad.
I showed that I can fight, because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the final I will have to jump technically better”, admitted Lićwinko in front of the Eurosport camera.
In the qualifiers, the American Vashti Cunningham and Belarusian Karyna Demidik turned out to be the best - 1.94 each.
Both players were the only ones who did not lose any height.
The women&#39;s high jump final is scheduled for Monday.
Start at 19.30 Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki is in a serious condition in the hospital
He was taken to the hospital, where doctors describe his condition as serious.
Needless to say, he is conscious and aware.
&quot;We believe that he will come out of this, that he will win again.
We all pray that he recovers, &quot;said an anonymous close person of Kornel Morawiecki in an interview with journalists of &quot;Super Express&quot;.
In the upcoming elections, the prime minister&#39;s father is running for the Senate.
&quot;My closest family and politics keep me alive,&quot; said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview he gave to &quot;Super Express&quot; journalists two weeks ago.
In January, &quot;Super Express&quot; reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki was examined at the Military Hospital in Wrocław.
“I developed strange, disturbing symptoms and went to the hospital.
Turns out I have jaundice.
But the worst was ahead of me.
When a CT scan was performed, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer…”, said the Prime Minister&#39;s father.
A few days later, at the hospital of the Ministry of Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a serious operation.
As Morawiecki said, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, Father Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.
“I know that many people have prayed for me, for which I am very grateful.
Fortunately, I don&#39;t have any metastases.
I don&#39;t know yet if I will be undergoing chemotherapy.
I put myself in the hands of specialist doctors who are rather optimistic.
For now, after this hard operation, I need to get back to some usable state.
I hope everything will be fine, &quot;said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview with &quot;SE&quot; in January.
&quot;If I had undergone the examination too late, the situation would have been tragic and I would have said goodbye to this hell...&quot;, he added.
Krakow: A 14-year-old girl is missing

She was last seen at St. Old Gosciniec in Krakow.
Nel Stokłosa is 14 years old, 167 cm tall, has blonde hair and gray-blue eyes.
When last seen, she was wearing a sweatshirt, gray pants, and boots.

The power of Oława jumps.
The title of the report from the amateur sports competition, played on Sunday afternoon, September 15 at the hippodrome at Oleandry Street in Oława, may be misleading for some.
The road to true power is long, but this is the name used to describe one of the types of horse competition...
The power of jumping competition consists in overcoming by the rider and the horse higher and higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.
It is worth adding here that the long-term and still unbeaten world record, set in 1949 by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse &quot;Huaso&quot;, is 247 cm.
Of course, no one jumped so high in Oława, but the result of the best local amazons at the level of 135 cm is also not the worst...
The competition organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of JKS &quot;W saddle&quot;, was a show part of the &quot;Rainbow Riding Competition&quot; held there a little earlier, about which we write more in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
Eight horse riders, training horse riding in JKS in Oława, joined the competition.
Four competed on ponies and four on large horses.
In the first group, Nikola Szołdra, riding on the crazy &quot;Sprinter&quot;, did the best job.
This small but very dynamic steed started by overcoming obstacles set at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at the station with the upper beam 125 cm from the ground.
However, he did not give up easily and only after three consecutive refusals was he removed from further competition by the competition jury.
The second place in pony jumping was taken by Amelia Pawlak, riding &quot;Fama&quot;, and the third place was taken by Lena Boruń on &quot;Harmider&quot;.
The youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman - fought ambitiously, galloping and jumping over obstacles on a small mare &quot;Carmen&quot;.
Even greater emotions accompanied the starting amazons and spectators during the competition with the participation of large horses.
Paulina Szewczyk, riding &quot;Declaration&quot; and Anastazja Abramenko, riding &quot;Lotka&quot;, had some dangerous-looking falls.
Fortunately, apart from minor bruises, neither the amazons nor the horses were hurt, so they continued to participate in the competition.
Weronika Łuczkiewicz, who was riding her, had a lot of problems with introducing the young mare &quot;Wineta&quot; to the showcourse.
Either the trainer&#39;s assistance was needed, or another pairing horse, followed by a bit crazy &quot;Wineta&quot;.
After passing the obstacle, she also went down the parkour at full gallop, so sometimes it got dangerous in the boxes and on the warm-up area. “Everything is under control!”, Jan Sienkiewicz reassured the somewhat frightened spectators, especially the youngest ones.
From the beginning of the competition for large horses, Marta Masalska, riding the beautifully presented &quot;Whiskey&quot;, was doing great on the arena.
This dignified mare, together with an experienced horsewoman, was the first to jump over 135 cm in the second attempt in the final phase, which was the best result of the competition at that moment.
After a while, however, the same height was also achieved by Paulina Szewczyk on &quot;Declaration&quot;, Weronika Łuczkiewicz on &quot;Wineta&quot; and Anastazja Abramenko on &quot;Lotka&quot;.
Therefore, all these contestants left together to decorate the flo and receive material prizes in the form of equestrian equipment, and finally, together with horse pony amazons, they performed an impressive round of honor to the rhythm of Radecki&#39;s march, ending this interesting and exciting competition.
Thanks
The Equestrian Sports Club &quot;W Siodle&quot; would like to thank the sponsors of the jump power competition during the 16th &quot;Rainbow Equestrian Competition&quot;: the City Hall in Oława, the Water and Sewage Plant in Oława, the District Office and the &quot;Mustang&quot; company.
Max Kolonko cuts himself off from KWW Max Kolonko&#39;s Patriotic Revolution
Max Kolonko&#39;s KWW Patriotic Revolution is the name of the election committee under which Mariusz Max Kolonka&#39;s #R Revolution political formation was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution directed its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.
Before the election, Kolonko announced cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Paweł Kukiz, but none of these coalitions came to fruition, and Max Kolonko&#39;s Patriotic Revolution KWW itself did not even manage to collect enough signatures to issue lists in any constituency in Poland.
Now Kolonko announced on Twitter that he had ended his cooperation with Max Kolonko&#39;s Patriotic Revolution KWW.
&quot;I will expect the above-mentioned KWW to delete my name from the name.
I kindly ask you not to associate me with the above-mentioned entity”, he added and announced that more information would be provided soon.
For now, it is not known whether the journalist will continue his work or whether this is the end of the #R Revolution formation.
On July 4, on the American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, staying in the USA, informed about the creation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has become famous for running the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.
“We are fed up with politicians, we are fed up with your stupid games, we are fed up with your amateur governments.
It is time for the Nation to take over the power in the state and rule for the Nation&#39;s sake, Kolonko said at the time.
The party program included: issues related to the judiciary (should be elected in general elections), tax changes (equal tax-free allowance for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid for NATO&#39;s eastern flank countries, with particular emphasis on Poland), holding a referendum on gun ownership, limiting the number of deputies or introducing single-member constituencies.
A few days after the announcement of the new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko started talks with Marek Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted information on his social media profile suggesting that #R would join forces with the Kukiz&#39;15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions ultimately came to fruition.
UBS: Zloty close to the balance point
“The euro exchange rate will stay around the level of PLN 4.35 in the coming months, which will be accompanied by a weak economic situation on the global markets,” announces Michael Bolliger from UBS Wealth Management.
“The expectations of maintaining a solid rate of economic growth and a stable monetary policy speak in favor of stabilizing the zloty at the current level,” the specialist estimates in an interview with Bankier.pl.
In his opinion, despite clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise interest rates in an environment where the vast majority of central banks are easing policy.
“While the zloty is properly valued - the euro quotations should remain around PLN 4.35 in the coming months - Polish bonds are not very attractive in his opinion.
Emerging market bonds offer much better yields than Polish bonds,” assesses Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation for emerging markets at UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the global economic situation.
&quot;The global slowdown may deepen, but it should not lead to a severe recession, and at the very least, GDP growth should fall slightly below zero,&quot; announces Michael Bolliger.
“Investors should underweight global equities, which may be harmed by the lack of prospects for resolving the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risks, including the Trump impeachment procedure and Brexit.
Among the equity markets, Europe should perform relatively the weakest,” according to the latest letter to investors from UBS Wealth Management chief executive Mark Haefele.
“Eurozone equities should outperform US equities as they are more vulnerable amid heightened global trade uncertainty and fears of a slowdown,” the document reads.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the boom in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the yields of German 10-year bonds even to minus 0.74 percent, it is still possible to deepen the decline in yields.
However, in the longer term, the yields on long-term securities should no longer fall, but only on short-term ones, due to the easing of the banks&#39; monetary policy.
The Fed has the greatest scope for interest rate cuts, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency in the coming years.
The long-term equilibrium point for the euro is USD 1.29, which would mean a 19% potential for the single currency to strengthen against the dollar.
We expect further rate cuts by the Fed, which will result in narrowing differences in monetary policy around the world.
“The long-term strength of the dollar may not be sustained by current and budget deficits,” predicts Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehr loses its weapons.
Confidential report of the German Ministry of National Defense
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has recorded the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 rounds of ammunition, according to a confidential list prepared by the Federal Ministry of Defence.
The news was reported by the press belonging to the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the parliamentary office of Peter Tauber, the secretary of state at the Ministry of National Defense (CDU), two weapons, one part of a weapon and 3,474 rounds of ammunition have been traced so far.
Military equipment still missing includes six MG3 general-purpose machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic carbines, six flare pistols and two P8 pistols.
In addition, 30 MG3 machine gun barrels are missing.
Concern over the situation was expressed by the vice-president of the Left party, Martina Renner.
She told RND reporters that the number of guns and ammunition missing was &quot;appalling&quot;.
The more so that as a result of the investigations, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these actions as a &quot;misting balance sheet&quot;.
She also criticized the fact that the list does not show whether there are also weapons that were found during the investigation against Bundeswehr Lieutenant Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor&#39;s office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening the security of the state and of violating the provisions of the law regulating access to firearms.
The officer was accused of preparing attacks on leading German politicians for extreme right-wing and racist motives.
His &quot;black list&quot; of targets, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor&#39;s office, included, among others: the then Minister of Justice Heiko Maas from the SPD, Claudia Roth from the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, a human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. illegally came into possession of four firearms, over 1,000 rounds of ammunition and over 50 explosives.
Crying children on the plane.
How to avoid them?
There is a solution
Japan Airlines recently introduced a feature designed for people who find traveling with a crying baby a nightmare.
Via the website, the airlines allow you to check the distribution of seats on the plane.
If a minor under the age of two travels on a given connection, the &quot;child icon&quot; appears on a specific seat reserved by parents or guardians.
Thus, the person using the carrier&#39;s services has the option of choosing a place far away from the one occupied by the toddler.
The BBC reports that the airlines have already informed about the imperfection of this solution.
The &quot;child icon&quot; will not appear if the ticket was booked by a third party or if there was a last-minute change of plane.
As expected, the idea divided Internet users.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved by using noise-canceling headphones.
They&#39;re kids, we used to be too.
&quot;We need to learn to be tolerant because we&#39;re going to need a seating map for mouth-breathing, drooling, and drunks soon,&quot; user G Sundar wrote.
Another Internet user noted that he used to be disturbed by crying children on the plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent himself.
There is also no shortage of supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
&quot;Thank you for warning me about screaming children on a 13-hour journey,&quot; wrote Rahat Ahmed.
Mallorca is counting losses after the bankruptcy of the travel agency Thomas Cook
Over 25,000 foreign tourists will not come on holiday to Mallorca in October as a result of Thomas Cook&#39;s bankruptcy announced on Monday.
Marc Pons, the representative of the autonomous government of the Balearic Islands, announced on Friday that among 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take advantage of their October holiday in Mallorca, there are also people who were supposed to travel with companies indirectly related to Thomas Cook, e.g. Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80 percent. of expected holidaymakers who, due to the bankruptcy of a British company, had to give up their holidays in Mallorca next month, are citizens of Germany and Scandinavian countries.
However, according to Pons, due to the fact that Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island in November-April, the losses to the local economy will be smaller.
It revealed that the Balearic government had already started negotiations with international operators about &quot;entering the Mallorcan market&quot; following the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to the estimates of the newspaper &quot;Diario de Mallorca&quot;, more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourist crisis in Mallorca.
About 800 are redundant employees of the Thomas Cook office in Palma.
The remaining people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, with Thomas Cook&#39;s declaration of bankruptcy, many Mallorca hotels were demanding guests to pay an additional fee for the night.
This situation was experienced by dozens of tourists from Poland.
The government of the Balearic Islands estimates that by Thursday, dozens of hotels in Mallorca had stopped operating at least until the end of October due to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook and companies cooperating with him.
In turn, the Friday daily &quot;Diario de Ibiza&quot; indicates that most of the hotels operating in Ibiza that have cooperated with the Thomas Cook group do not intend to close their facilities in the coming weeks.
The newspaper recalls that on this Balearic island, the British bankrupt cooperated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous government of the Balearic Islands announced that it would ask the Spanish government to support the region with 100 million euros to cover losses caused by the bankruptcy of travel company Thomas Cook.
They revealed that the most injured tourists in this archipelago, about 36 thousand. people, is located in Mallorca.
According to the data of the Balearic government, Thomas Cook is in arrears with local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the period July-September 2019, approximately EUR 5 million.

Rzeczpospolita: Smog has crushed the government
&quot;The effects of the &quot;Clean Air&quot; program are negligible, and coal stoves will continue to smoke this winter as if nothing had happened,&quot; reads the front page of today&#39;s &quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot;.
&quot;So far, 82,000 applications have been submitted under the &quot;Clean Air&quot; programme. applications for co-financing with a total value of PLN 2 billion, of which 48,000 decisions were positive.
The approved applications amount to over PLN 915 million in total,” reports Rzeczpospolita, citing data from the spokesman for the Minister of the Environment.
As the newspaper points out, only part of the costs incurred is reimbursed from the program.
The results of the pompously announced program are assessed by the daily as &quot;modest&quot;.
Local government officials, quoted by Rzeczpospolita, see the failure of &quot;Clean Air&quot;, among others too much bureaucracy.
“The program should be much simpler: electronic notification, sending invoices by post, possible random control of implementation.
This would streamline operations,” believes the mayor of Lidzbark Warmiński, Jacek Wiśniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alarm note that in the first year of operation, less than 1 percent of the projects were implemented. the assumed goal of replacing 3 million smoking boilers.
As Rzeczpospolita notes, although the budget of the program is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, i.e. PLN 10 billion annually, this amount is virtual.
Only PLN 1.4 billion has been reserved in the budget of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management for this year.
Congress agrees to F-35 for Poland
Błaszczak: Now price negotiations
The US Congress has approved the sale of 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft to Poland.
&quot;This is one of the last steps before concluding the contract, but our work is not over,&quot; wrote Mariusz Błaszczak on Twitter.
“We will negotiate hard to achieve the best possible price,” added the Polish minister.
Contract for Polish F-35
The Polish air force is to ultimately supply 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters manufactured by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the US State Department approved their sale to Poland.
The communiqué emphasized that the investment will support the national security and foreign policy of the United States by improving the security of the NATO ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to information from the State Department, Poland is to pay USD 6.5 billion for the fighters.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract will also include the supply of replacement and repair parts, training equipment, engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related elements of the logistics support and staff training program.
Lockheed Martin F-35 fighters
The F-35 Lightning II fighter produced by Lockheed Martin is a fifth-generation single-seat, single-engine multi-role fighter.
The aircraft is capable of performing close support missions, bombing missions and typically fighter air combat tasks.
Thanks to the use of stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable for short-range radars.
Recently, Belgium bought F-35 fighters under a contract worth 4.55 billion dollars.
The Belgians want to replace the aging F-16 with them.
Other U.S. allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, are also to consider purchasing American combat aircraft.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
The manufacturer Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls.
In this way, he wants to fight stereotypes.
The manufacturer Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls
In addition to Barbies with different skin colors, shapes and hairstyles, Mattel has launched gender-neutral dolls.
The toys in the &quot;Creatable World&quot; series wear wigs.
Children can therefore decide whether their Barbie should have short or long hair.
Their wardrobe consists of both trousers and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can change from girls to boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothes.
Emphasizing gender characteristics was also abandoned - gender dolls no longer have full lips, long eyelashes and a slim waist or - in the case of Ken - broad shoulders.
The company believes that children do not like their dolls to have gender norms, and some parents and feminists believe that gender-specific toys inhibit girls&#39; ambitions and reinforce traditional stereotypes.
&quot;The new dolls will allow all children to feel free,&quot; says Mattel.
The Barbie doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a swimsuit and high-heeled shoes, has been repeatedly criticized in the past for promoting &quot;unhealthy female stereotypes&quot;, such as unnatural body proportions.
The company reacted to the criticism and has already launched dolls with different skin colors, as well as more rounded shapes.
There were also dolls in hijab.
Zandberg: circle or club Together may have several deputies
Zandberg, asked on ZET radio, how many candidates of his party can get to the Sejm from the lists of left-wing parties (KW SLD, whose lists run candidates for the Sejm of SLD, Spring and Lewica Together, running with the common logo &quot;Lewica&quot;), he replied that it depends from the result of the committee.
&quot;I believe that the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people hope that the Left is not only right, but also has strength,&quot; he noted.
According to Zandberg, this means that the left can have 60-80 deputies.
“This may mean that the circle or the Together club will have a dozen or so deputies.
But it depends on Polish women and men.
I&#39;m not going to guess and say how it&#39;s going to happen,&quot; he said.
When asked whether Left Together will have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: &quot;We have an agreement that we are diverse, and we will not pretend that this diversity does not exist.
I think that this diversity was rewarded by the Poles, because we showed that, despite being different, we were able to agree on a common program.”
When asked whether the biggest beneficiary of the joint start is the SLD leader Włodzimierz Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that in his opinion the biggest beneficiaries are the center-left and left-wing voters.
In turn, when he pointed out that the SLD would get the entire subsidy, he replied that &quot;the goal of a political party is to represent its voters.&quot;
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in the elections to the Sejm.
In the case of the elections to the Senate, he indicated that he was considering.
&quot;The offer is diverse and in this offer there are candidates to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart is further away&quot;, he stated.
&quot;I will say very honestly and clearly that if I was in the Senate district No. 44, I would take the electoral certificate and vote in another district,&quot; emphasized the politician.
&quot;I don&#39;t think I would be tempted to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (KO - PAP candidate),&quot; he added.
In this constituency, apart from Ujazdowski, Paweł Kasprzak, the leader of Citizens of the Republic of Poland, and Marek Rudnicki from PiS are running.
Dakar: West Africa&#39;s largest mosque opened
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered on Friday in the capital for the inauguration of a huge mosque, believed to be the largest in West Africa.
Muslims flocked by bus, car and on foot to the Bopp district, where a new mosque with a capacity of 30,000 was erected. faithful.
The facility was built by the Mouride brotherhood, which belongs to the Sufi trend of Islam that dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a swampy area of six hectares donated by the government.
The name of the mosque Massalikul Jinan (&quot;Paths to Paradise&quot;) comes from the title of a poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the brotherhood who is revered as a saint by his followers.

In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca has a capacity of 105,000. faithful.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than €30 million, was financed by private donations.
The government, in addition to land, funded lighting, sanitary facilities and financed road works worth EUR 10.5 million.
Coach Smyła: Our problem is not Silesia, but ourselves
Korona&#39;s players will try to break the streak of eight league matches without a victory in Friday&#39;s meeting with Śląsk, the vice-leader of the Ekstraklasa.
&quot;Our problem is not the inhabitants of Wrocław, but ourselves, we have to work on what we play&quot;, emphasized the coach of the Kielce team, Mirosław Smyła.
Korona&#39;s players recorded their last and so far only victory in the league in the first round, when they defeated Raków Częstochowa 1:0 away.
Later, Kielce recorded two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 to Zagłębie Lubin in the 1/32 finals of the Polish Cup.
“I am optimistic that in the last seconds of the cup match the players were fighting for a goal, they wanted to draw.
Their fall to the pitch after the final whistle was not due to a breakdown, but it was a fall of anger because they were so close,&quot; said Smyła.
As he pointed out, Śląsk has very strong wings, so he will sensitize the team to play in the side sectors of the pitch.
&quot;We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play,&quot; added the coach.
In Friday&#39;s match in Korona, Ognjen Gnjatic, who is suspended for the excess of yellow cards, will not play, the injured Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski will also be absent from the team.
On the other hand, it is encouraging that several players signed up for the cup match with the desire to play.
&quot;We have a headache, recently it seemed that it would not be there, and now it is,&quot; said Smyla.
Korona&#39;s defender Daniel Dziwniel emphasized that Śląsk would not be an easy opponent to break the streak of eight league games in a row without a win, while in the Ekstraklasa anyone can win against anyone.
“We are a good team.
In recent weeks, we may not show it on the pitch, but the moment will come when we will win and we believe that it will be on Friday.
After nine rounds of the Ekstraklasa, Korona is ranked 15th with five points.
Śląsk collected 12 more and ranks second.
Friday&#39;s match in Kielce will start at 8.30 p.m.
These trees may completely disappear from Europe
&quot;42 percent of tree species that make up Europe&#39;s forest stand are threatened,&quot; warns the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in the &quot;Red List of European Trees&quot; published on Friday.
At the top of the list are chestnuts and mountain ash.
The IUCN, an organization based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered European tree species for the first time.
It was prepared by specialists who, on the basis of research, came to the conclusion that out of 454 species of trees found in Europe (as well as in other places of the world), 42 per cent. is &quot;highly endangered&quot;.
Among the causes, the Red Book mentions the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, the most threatened are those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.
When it comes to a typically European tree stand, according to IUCN specialists, 58% of trees are threatened. species, and 15 percent, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are threatened with extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Book mentions errors in the exploitation of forest stands, accelerated urbanization, too intensive tree felling, followed by forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and lichens is also seriously threatened.
&quot;The consequences of human activities are leading to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and pose a threat of extinction in Europe of important and underestimated varieties that underpin European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet,&quot; concluded the report Luc Bas, who heads the European office of the IUCN.
Grzegorz Schetyna: I will not promise 600+
&quot;Today, PiS wants to bribe Poles by offering them a loan for freedom that future generations will have to pay back,&quot; says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview for &quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot;.
In his opinion, &quot;the whole PiS policy is a pic&quot;.
At the same time, the politician promises that &quot;what is given will not be taken away&quot;.
Schetyna assures in an interview with Jacek Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat Law and Justice.
It is about mobilizing the electorate at the ballot box.
In his opinion, the opposition has greater potential in this respect than Kaczyński&#39;s party.
&quot;Today, there are more conscious people who want to live in a normal country than supporters of PiS, a party that has betrayed its preached values, such as modesty, humility and transparency,&quot; says Schetyna.
The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic Platform also pointed out the basic assumptions of the KO election program.
&quot;First of all, nothing given will not be taken away, but you need to set a direction for the future, because PiS deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even from dramatically low investments,&quot; he said.
Secondly, it is about &quot;activating the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work diligently - and those who are entrepreneurial.&quot;
Schetyna explains that the KO program included, among others, a project that will give Poles who earn the least PLN 614 more per hand, and those who earn more - also several hundred zlotys each.
The politician also indicated that he did not want to race for distribution.
As he said, he will do as much as he can do, but will not promise 600+.
&quot;I will never allow the Greek variant, where the rulers bid with the opposition for giveaways, until the country finally collapsed financially,&quot; he stressed.
In an interview with Rzeczpospolita, Schetyna also stated that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
&quot;We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda,&quot; he said.
“Pride goes before a fall.
Kaczyński is such a statesman as Banaś is crystal clear&quot;, he added.
The PO leader also said that he had not yet decided whether he would apply for the leadership of the PO.
Argentina: Six dead giant condors
Six giant condors have been found dead in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, TVN24 reports.
Experts believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.
Giant condors have probably been poisoned with an agent to kill predators such as pumas, foxes and wild dogs.
The animals may have eaten the toxic carrion.
Apart from one juvenile, the rest of the dead condors were adults.
“This is a big loss for the environment because the condor needs to be 10-15 years old to become fertile and able to reproduce.
So we are losing a protected species, an endangered species,” says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.
“I think using toxic bait and poison puts not only this species at risk, but all other life forms, including human health,” he adds.
Rzeczpospolita: They want a jewel for the president
Work has begun on granting the head of state a precious chain.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Duda&#39;s law firm – we read in &quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot;.
As the newspaper explains, it is about the gold chain of the Order of the White Eagle, a royal insignia officially called the jewel of the Republic of Poland in the interwar period.
The last time it was probably used by President Ignacy Mościcki.
Rzeczpospolita reports that such a chain may soon end up on Andrzej Duda&#39;s arms.
On Wednesday, the Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and Petitions approved a motion to start work on an amendment to the Orders and Decorations Act in order to restore it.
The daily writes that this is also not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of state.
The Senate already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was lost by one vote.
This time the work is instant.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to this matter, recognizing that they would consult the Chancellery of the President.
This one came in mid-September.
&quot;I kindly inform you that the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position presented in the petition in question&quot;, wrote the President&#39;s Minister Andrzej Dera at that time.
On Wednesday, the Senate committee continued the case and again devoted little time to the matter.
&quot;The President&#39;s office gave us a short answer: it is in favor of restoring it,&quot; said the head of the commission, Robert Mamątow from PiS, quoted by Rzeczpospolita.
He submitted a motion to start legislative work, which the committee supported.
Police officers will teach drivers how to drive through the intersection
Political action will be at the intersection of al. Ciepliński from al. Pilsudski.
The actions of the uniformed officers are somehow related to the recent complaints of the city authorities about drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the intersection.
On Friday, September 27, police officers in Rzeszów begin preventive actions called &quot;Passable Crossroads&quot;.
The point is to eliminate traffic impediments: entering the intersection without the possibility of exit, failure to comply with light signals or road signs.
&quot;We often think that we are alone at the intersection, but in fact we make life difficult for other drivers,&quot; said Marek Ustrobinski, the city&#39;s deputy mayor, a few days ago.
His words resounded at a press conference at the town hall, where the city authorities presented examples of improper movement of cars at intersections, which in turn creates traffic jams.
At that time, the president appealed to travelers to be reasonable on the road and m. speeding off at traffic lights or not texting while driving.
The topic has been taken over by the Rzeszów policemen, who are starting the &quot;Passable crossroads&quot; campaign from today.
What is it about?
The aim of the activities is to eliminate the phenomenon of limiting traffic at intersections by drivers entering them without being able to continue driving.
This is a common offense that contributes to traffic congestion and congestion.
It is punishable by a fine of PLN 300 and 2 penalty points.
In addition, uniformed officers will pay attention to non-compliance with light signals or road signs and incorrect parking in the area of intersections.
They will also observe the lack of fluidity of driving, late starting from traffic lights, slow crossings and leaving too large distances between vehicles.
At what intersections will the actions be carried out?
among others on ul. Lisa-Kuli from ul. Jagiellońska; al. Ciepliński from al. Pilsudski; st. Targowa with al. Pilsudski; Śreniawitów Square with ul. Dąbrowskiego or ul. Hetmańska with al. Warsaw insurgents.
This type of actions in the capital of Podkarpacie will be carried out on consecutive Fridays in October.
They inspected the company that disposes of waste from &quot;Czajka&quot;
&quot;Officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Wołomin County Starosty and the Poviat Building Supervision Inspectorate inspected on Friday the installation in the Zielonka commune, where waste from the &quot;Czajka&quot; sewage treatment plant in Warsaw is disposed of,&quot; said Karol Szyszko, spokesman for the Wołomin County.
Inspectors from the Wołomin county carried out an inspection at the plant located in the forests belonging to the Zielonka commune.
Prywatny Zakład Handlowo-Transportowy &quot;Dar-Trans&quot;, pursuant to an agreement with the sewage treatment plant &quot;Czajka&quot; in Warsaw, provides sewage waste management services.
“The installation was inspected, and the entrepreneur was asked to provide documentation related to his business activity,” said Szyszko.
He added that the post-inspection report will be forwarded to, among others, to the Voivodship Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw.
The last inspection in &quot;Dar-Trans&quot; was carried out by the Voivodship Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw in the period from December 29, 2015 to February 11, 2016.
It was then established that the company did not collect samples, measure and test groundwater, and did not have the results of tests of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the &quot;Czajka&quot; sewage treatment plant.
After the VIEP inspection, Dariusz Sobota was requested to stop violating the terms of the decision.
Prywatny Zakład Handlowo-Transportowy &quot;DAR-TRANS&quot; Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies collecting waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the &quot;Czajka&quot; sewage treatment plant.
Pursuant to the decision to dispose of waste in the excavation area, waste weighing up to 60,000 tons per year is processed in the forests near Zielonka.
The Warsaw Municipal Water and Sewage Company informed last Thursday that at the turn of November and December 2018, the STUOŚ was shut down due to damage to one of the incineration plant equipment.
As reported by MPWiK, the monthly cost of their export is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of the cost of export from January 1, 2019 to August 31, 2019).
Lech Wałęsa supported Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
&quot;You have undertaken a difficult task, you can count on my full support,&quot; Lech Wałęsa said on Friday to Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
“Mr. President, these words are very important to me,” replied the Civic Coalition&#39;s candidate for prime minister, the leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that as far as the situation in Poland is concerned, he is now &quot;just a retired fan&quot;.
Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska met on Friday with former President Lech Wałęsa in his office at the European Solidarity Center in Gdańsk.
Wałęsa&#39;s son, Jarosław, also took part in a short conversation behind closed doors.
“You have undertaken a difficult task”, said Lech Wałęsa after the meeting.
&quot;You can count on my full support,&quot; he added.
“The problems facing Poland are known to all of us.
Therefore, it is a great hope that you, as a woman, will deal with these problems, and all of us - those who love Poland - will support your actions as much as possible, said the former president, addressing Kidawa-Błońska.
Very important words
Kidawa-Błońska thanked for the support.
&quot;Mr. President, these words are very important to me, because no one else can talk about freedom, about the constitution, and knows how important it is,&quot; she said.
&quot;Let&#39;s show that it is possible to do a different, wise policy together, but in accordance with the constitution, in accordance with the law, in accordance with respect for others.
This is how you did your revolution, and this is how we want to change Poland,” stressed Kidawa-Błońska.
Retired fan
Wałęsa said in an interview with journalists that he was now &quot;just a retired fan&quot;.
“Of course I&#39;m looking at it.
I hope that we will reverse the course of events, that what was good, proven, will return (to this).
The separation of powers is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are absolutely necessary.
And it all needs to be cleaned up, it all needs to be brought back to normal, and I believe we&#39;re going to do that this time.
Because if not, we will face the street criterion,” said Lech Wałęsa.
“That is why it is so important for Poles to go to the polls, think about it and make a decision on their own.
And this is the most important thing”, added Kidawa-Błońska.
“Last chance to improve the state of affairs in Poland with a piece of paper,” the former president replied.
&#39;We need to build a new foundation&#39;
When asked about the most important changes for her that should take place in Poland, Kidawa-Błońska said: “Mr. President said very well.
We have to build a new foundation on which we can do all other things.
Since the separation of powers does not exist, since the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it obvious so that everyone knows that otherwise Poland will not move a step forward.
Volleyball ME: Slovenia - Poland 3:1 in the semi-final.
On the hot terrain in Ljubljana, Polish volleyball players clashed with Slovenians in the semi-finals of the European Championships.
There was no shortage of controversies and discussions with the judges, with the Polish coach Vital Heynen in the lead role.
&quot;Biało-Czerwoni&quot; lost 1:3 and will play for the bronze medal.
The Senate decided on key bills
The Senate adopted, without amendments, the bills on disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important state officials and on the flights of the most important people in the state.
52 senators voted for the amendment to the act on family assets of state officials - without amendments - 14 were against, three abstained from voting.
Thus, the senators decided to reject 12 amendments submitted during Wednesday&#39;s debate by PO senator Sławomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments were intended to &quot;civilize&quot; the act and limit the scope of information provided in the declaration on the financial situation of one&#39;s own children, children of the spouse, children adopted in cases where the children remain in a common household with the person obliged to submit the declaration.
The act on disclosure of assets of the families of the most important state officials, drafted by the Prime Minister&#39;s office, was passed by the Sejm on 11 September.
The regulations stipulate that the prime minister, ministers, deputies, members of the European Parliament, senators, presidents of: the Constitutional Tribunal, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as persons heading other state institutions will be obliged to include information on the personal property of spouses, children and dependents in the asset declaration in shared use.
The Senate also did not propose amendments to the law on flights of the most important people in the state.
It regulates which flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government planes along with the most important people in the country.
The Act also specifies who is responsible for keeping the Central Register of Flights.
55 senators were in favor of the bill – without amendments – 12 were against it and four abstained from voting.
According to the act, each flight of the president will be a flight &quot;performed on an official mission&quot;.
In the flights, the president will be able to be accompanied by family members and other persons invited by the president.
On the other hand, the flight in the official mission of the Prime Minister and the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate will be only a flight &quot;carried out in order to perform tasks directly related to the function performed&quot;.
The Act also specifies the list of persons who may accompany the most important people in the country during the flight.
According to the regulations, members of the delegation - invited deputies, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts - may be on board the aircraft; persons providing technical, medical or organizational support; as well as journalists.
Pursuant to the Act, in the event of doubts related to the flights of the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister will request clarification.
If such doubts are not clarified within the specified time, the head of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister will be obliged to notify the heads of the Chancelleries of the Sejm or Senate of the impossibility of organizing such a flight.

Poles, after the first training in Paris, are waiting for the last rival
On Friday, Polish volleyball players had their first training in Paris, where on Saturday they will play in the match for the bronze medal.
Vital Heynen&#39;s charges closed the way to winning the title on Thursday&#39;s defeat with the Slovenians 1: 3 in Ljubljana.
There was a lot of talk about their troubles with traveling to this duel.
This time there were no such problems - on Friday morning they went together with the Slovenes by charter to Paris, and a few hours later they had a training session in the famous Bercy hall.
According to the accounts of people present at the classes, the coach of the world champions was nervous.
As noted by Heynen&#39;s assistant, Michał Mieszko Gogol, this time the main task was not just practicing volleyball elements.
“We went to the hall, but for the most part it was time for the team.
It was about spending more time together than training.
Talk, think about how to rebuild it all as a team,” he reported.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the coaching staff.
“We were brutally brought down to earth.
We are undeniably disappointed.
We still believed that we would come back to this game.
We discussed this match among ourselves in the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.
As the two main reasons for the defeat, I would point to ineffectiveness in attack and much worse than usual handling of situation balls.
The Slovenes were much better than us in this regard,” he analyzed.
In his opinion, &quot;White-Red&quot; was not prevented by the stress associated with the performance against the co-hosts of the tournament, supported by a loud and large audience.
He admitted, however, that the world champions could be a bit sleepy due to the smooth road to the semi-finals.
“Perhaps if we had suffered a similar defeat in the group stage, we would have learned the lesson sooner and then we would have played differently later in the tournament.
But that&#39;s just a guess,&quot; he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Thursday&#39;s defeat of the Poles will be turned into aggression in the match for bronze.
“I hope we will show our true colors then.
There&#39;s something to fight for.
The last time we won the ME medal was in 2011”, he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city and France the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
They competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam in the group stage, traveled to Apeldoorn for the first two matches of the group stage, and moved to Ljubljana for the semi-finals.
Nick Kyrgios: severe but suspended sentence
An Australian tennis player was given a 16-week ban and a $25,000 fine - suspended for six months - for reprehensible words, gestures and actions during recent ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour officials are losing patience with Kyrgios, but still give him a chance to improve.
The summary of the most uncouth professional tennis player in recent years looks grim - 16 weeks off plus a hefty fine, but both sentences are suspended for six months - a probationary period during which the recalcitrant athlete can improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been causing trouble for a long time and earned a tennis world record - he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of the sport for breaking the rules of conduct on and off the court.
Loud swearing, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the referee and spectators, breaking two rackets during a loss to Karen Khachanov - for all this, after the ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati in August, he paid $113,000.
He did not play long in the US Open 2019 either, but he managed to publicly say that the ATP officials are &quot;corrupt&quot;, which hurt the organization&#39;s authorities so much that they launched a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks announced the verdict of suspension and another fine.
Words about corruption, however, were forgiven after listening to the accused and learning the context of the statement.
However, in the justification, tennis officials said that the investigation showed that Kyrgios&#39; behavior throughout the past 12 months in many cases raised serious objections and constituted an almost continuous violation of the rules, that he constantly insulted tournament people and spectators in a vulgar manner, hence the heavy penalty.
However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the sentence, ordering that several conditions be met within the next six months: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour tournaments, Kyrgios may no longer violate the rules of the Code of Conduct for professional tennis players in any way, in in particular, may no longer swear, destroy rackets, argue with the referees or the audience, or otherwise behave indecently or vulgarly.
He was also advised to seek &quot;constant support&quot; from mental coaches during tournaments and to consult with people specializing in solving problems of athletes who are not coping with appropriate behavior in the off-season.
Nick Kyrgios&#39; first comment (on social media) to the verdict was: &quot;Hey everyone, I can still play.
I just need to control my behavior, that&#39;s all.&quot;
In practice, the Australian will have at least a two-week break anyway, as his shoulder injury worsened in the Laver Cup, so he had to give up the upcoming starts in Beijing (September 30-October 6) and Shanghai (October 6-13).
In the ATP ranking, Kyrgios is ranked 27th.
This year he won two tournaments - in Washington and Acapulco, earning over $1.3 million, so even after the fines he will have a lot left.
GUS: Life in Poland is getting better and better
The report on household budgets published on Friday by the Central Statistical Office shows that last year they assessed their financial situation as good or rather good. as much as 44 percent of them.
A year earlier, this percentage was 37.2 percent, in 2016 it was 33.5 percent, and earlier - since 2009, when the statistical office examined subjective assessments of the situation of households for the first time - it never exceeded 30 percent.
Last year, they considered their financial situation to be bad or rather bad. 8.1 percent in total households, compared to 11.2 percent. a year earlier and more than 20 percent. in 2009
The financial situation of self-employed households is the best.
In this group, over 70% consider it good or rather good. respondents.
At the other extreme are the households of pensioners, where the percentage of such answers was only 18%.
The subjective assessment of the financial situation of households is also strongly influenced by the number of children.
Single parents are the worst off, with 32% of them declaring a good or rather good financial situation.
Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60 percent, and among childless households it is 48.8 percent.
The effect of the 500+ program is clearly visible in these statistics.
Before it was launched (in 2016), single parents and large families (with at least three children) assessed their financial situation as the worst.
The improvement in the subjective assessment of the financial situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid increase in income, mainly from work.
However, this is not all, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good is growing faster than real income.
Moreover, at the level of voivodships there is no clear relationship between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The inhabitants of the Opolskie Voivodeship formulate the best opinions, where 48.9% consider their situation to be good or rather good. surveyed.
Then there are Lubuskie (47.7%), Śląskie (47.6%), Mazowieckie (47.3%) and Zachodniopomorskie (47.1%).
Meanwhile, in the Opolskie Voivodeship, the disposable income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) amounted to less than 94 percent the national average, and in Lubuskie 98 percent.
The inhabitants of Mazowiecki (120% of the national average) and Śląskie (104%) had the highest income.
In 2018, the average disposable income per person in Poland was PLN 1,693.
In real terms (adjusted for the impact of price changes), it increased by 4.3%. compared to 2017
This is quite low compared to previous years.
In 2016, income per capita increased by 7%, and a year later by 6.3%.
While revenue growth is slowing, expenditure growth is also slowing down.
These per person last year amounted to PLN 1,187, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7 percent.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person increased by 1.9% in real terms, and in 2016 by 4.3%.
Household budget surveys suggest that the statistical household currently spends 70.1% of of their disposable income, while in 2014 this share exceeded 80 percent, and by 2006 it exceeded 90 percent.

USA: Three suicides among aircraft carrier crew
Three sailors committed suicide aboard the USS George HW Bush last week, the US Navy said.
A total of five crew members on this ship have died in the past two years.
The previous suicide took place in July this year, and the earlier one in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each incident occurred on land when the USS George HW Bush was docked off the coast of Virginia.
So far, third party involvement has been ruled out.
Also, the deaths are not supposed to be related.
“We need everyone to get involved in making suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
I want to emphasize that there is no stigma or other repercussions associated with seeking help,&quot; Captain Sean Bailey, the ship&#39;s commander, wrote on Facebook.
Niesiołowski critical of the pope.
John Paul II did nothing
In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiołowski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.
&quot;Virtually every word he said was accepted.&quot;
Later, there was criticism of some of his actions.
“For me, the fact that John Paul II was unable to eliminate Rydzyk&#39;s harmful activities casts a great shadow over his pontificate.
After all, this Redemptorist – a pest of the Church and Poland – developed his media at its best during the life of the Polish Pope,” he explained.
A former PO politician admitted: &quot;there were murmurs of dissatisfaction, the pope said something, once he did not accept Rydzyk, but he had power and for politicking he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor there.
However, John Paul II did not do it, nor did his successors,” explained Niesiołowski.
“In addition, there was this fatal case of pedophilia and the actions of the Church, or rather the lack of them.
I was a little ahead of my mind, but I wanted to draw attention to the whole of his life.
We know about the scale of pedophilia in the Church relatively recently.
The question arises how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things,” says Niesiołowski in an interview with a journalist.
In the opinion of the former PO politician, the Polish Church is an ally of PiS.
“It must be admitted that during the period of Solidarity, the Church was our most important ally.
All celebrations began with a holy mass, crosses hung everywhere.
Now these crosses are PiS, they have become a symbol of dictatorship - a sign of the PiS regime.
I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of PiS.
This is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will have to pay dearly,” argued Niesiołowski.
&quot;I hope that Pope Francis will chase Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this type,&quot; he concluded.

PZPN throws penalties for brawling at stadiums.
Griffin disqualified
The clash of the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk almost ended tragically when a flare fired by fans from Wejherowo missed the opposing team&#39;s goalkeeper, Zlatan Alomerovic, by millimeters.
The match was suspended for 20 minutes after the incident.
The PZPN commission investigating this case imposed a severe penalty on Gryf, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to participate in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, fans will not be allowed in the next match to their own stadium.
They will also not be able to travel in groups to league matches until December 31.
Brawls at the Widzew Łódź stadium were also caused by fans of Śląsk Wrocław.
Here, however, the verdict of the PZPN was milder, because Śląsk warned that similar events could occur and sensitized the relevant authorities in this matter.
Despite this, the services allowed flares to be thrown at the sector of Łódź fans, the seats set on fire and the home sector to be forced.
This match was interrupted for eight minutes and the intervening police had to use a water cannon.
PZPN punished Śląsk with a one-off stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and forbade organizing trips to matches in this and the next edition of PP.
The travel ban also covers Ekstraklasa league matches, but it will last until December 31.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
GDDKiA plans to replace the markings on the entire managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzeszów
In Podkarpacie, the implementation of the amendment to the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among others, writing the names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish.
For example, &quot;Lviv&quot; will appear next to &quot;L&#39;viv&quot;.
In our voivodship, changes will be made to 94 road signs placed along the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it is supposed to be easier, clearer and simpler.
The new guidelines result from the amendment of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals as well as road safety devices.
“We should remember that place names in neighboring countries often also have a Polish sound.
Thanks to the change in the law prepared by us, they will finally appear on signposts along our roads.
We are starting the introduction of new markings from the Podkarpackie section of the A4 motorway”, informed the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
In Podkarpacie, changes will be made to 94 road signs along the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total investment cost?
200 thousand zloty.
First, the new signage will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned by November 1, 2019.
How should the idea be implemented?
There will be no exchange of boards, on the principle of pastings.
They will replace the currently functioning place names with new ones, written in Polish on the existing signs.
Both names will be written on one line - first in Polish, and then in the original, in parentheses.
This will be a great help for people who do not know the spelling of names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot the swan with an air rifle
In the pond in Zameczno in Lower Silesia, the inhabitants noticed a swan having problems with its wings.
After catching and visiting the vet, it turned out that someone had set a target for the animal - airgun pellets were found in its body.
&quot;Information about the wounded bird was received from the villagers by the Wild Animals Rehabilitation Center in Nowa Sól.
The report showed that the animal had broken wings.
We went to the place.
It was immediately obvious that something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so as not to hurt him or expose him to additional stress.
The swan was caught and taken to the vet.
After the first X-ray picture, it was already known that someone had made a shooting target out of it.
There were shards of shot in his body,” says Marcin Walasek, president of the Malpol company, which manages, among others, rehabilitation center.
He spends the winter at the resort
”The wounds were cleaned, the bird was given antibiotics, access to water, a safe place in the center where it will spend the whole winter.
We are trying to strengthen it.
He is unable to fly yet.
Releasing it now would mean that it would most likely not survive the winter,” adds Walasek.
After the swan is rehabilitated, the staff intends to release it in the spring to the same pond.
The authorities of the Żukowice commune, after receiving information about the cause of the poor health of the animal, intend to inform the prosecutor&#39;s office about the case.
The incident took place in Zameczno
Gowin: &quot;we need to stimulate Polish small trade&quot;
&quot;Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,&quot; said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Agreement, Jarosław Gowin, on Friday.
Gowin, during an interview in &quot;Signals of the day&quot; in radio Jedynka, stated that trade is controlled by international networks that impose such low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually develop.
Pointing out that this problem is very difficult to fight, the deputy prime minister recalled that the PiS government tried to deal with it at the very beginning of its term, but was &quot;countered by the European Commission&quot;.
&quot;We won before the court of justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next elections and forms a government, we will return to this topic,&quot; he said.
At the same time, he noted that &quot;effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the Polish problem, i.e. small trade.&quot;
&quot;We will have to consider whether the government or the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,&quot; said Gowin.
In May, an EU court ruled that the European Commission had made a mistake by considering that the Polish retail sales tax was illegal state aid.
The Retail Sales Tax Act provided for the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8 percent. on revenue between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4 percent. from revenue over PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was to apply from September 2016.
In September 2016, the European Commission initiated proceedings for infringement of EU law by Poland.
Brussels argued at the time that the design of the tax could favor smaller shops, which could be considered state aid.
She further stated that the levy had been implemented unlawfully.
It also issued an order to suspend the application of the tax until officials in Brussels completed its analysis.
Poland disagreed with this position, but the collection of the tax was suspended.
The May decision of the EU court paved the way for the reintroduction of the tax, but did not end the case.
On 24 July, the Commission lodged an appeal with the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the press service of the CJEU informed PAP that the case is currently at the written stage, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
For the time being, it is not known whether and when the oral procedure, i.e. the hearing of the parties and a possible hearing, will start.
It takes a good few to a dozen or so months from the date of filing the appeal to the announcement of the verdict.
&quot;Such proceedings take an average of a year,&quot; a source at the Luxembourg Court told PAP.
How to dress a baby for baptism?
We suggest some practical solutions
Baptism is an extremely important event in the life of a baby and its parents.
It is often the first occasion when the whole family gathers around the baby, celebrating its arrival in the world together.
No wonder that new moms and dads want their children to look their best on this day.
However, before you make the final decision about your child&#39;s outfit, think about whether it will also be comfortable.
In stores you can find many outfitted sets that do not provide the toddler with proper comfort.
So what should you pay attention to?
The basic criterion for choosing clothes for baptism is the age of the child
Until recently, babies of several weeks old were baptized, dressed in white sets and placed in the same baby blankets or large pillows.
Today, children entering the sacrament are often older: several months, a year, and even older.
It is not difficult to guess that such a big consolation needs a slightly different baptism outfit.
Therefore, if your child is 3-4 months old on the day of baptism, he will probably spend the ceremony in a pram or in the arms of his parents or godparents.
The best solution will therefore be to dress it up in comfortable, cotton rompers or sets.
Although this piece of clothing is considered an everyday outfit, just look for its festive variants, for example with a frill or lace.
For a boy, a body with a print of a bow tie and suspenders will be perfect.
In the case of older children, you can afford to be more imaginative in clothing.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple tulle dress
Many parents of girls longingly look towards richly decorated, ruffled baptism dresses complete with coats, headbands and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathable materials for their production, in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In search of the right clothes, it will be better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant clothes with cotton linings.
Delicate tulle skirts, satin dresses, lace, applications and charming sets will make your daughter look beautiful and feel comfortable.
The perfect outfit for a little gentleman: a cotton suit
Until recently, there was a fashion among boys&#39; parents for suits that were copies of &quot;adult&quot; models.
Polyester jackets and trousers, stiff collars or caps often made young elegant men loudly demonstrate their dissatisfaction.
Today, fortunately, they have been replaced by comfortable, cotton sets.
Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, i.e. soft, tracksuit shorts, and a blouse decorated on the front in the style of a vest.
These outfits look extremely festive, and at the same time do not restrict the movements of a toddler exploring the world.
Krystyna Pawłowicz published an asset declaration
Krystyna Pawłowicz submitted a declaration of assets at the end of the term of office.
It shows that the PiS MP collected 110,000. PLN savings.
Recall that Pawłowicz announced her retirement from politics.
At the end of his term, he has an amount of 110,000. zloty
According to the statement submitted by the MP, she receives a pension of PLN 4.7 thousand per month. zloty.
Pawłowicz owns a flat worth PLN 570,000. PLN and slightly smaller, which he rents, charging PLN 880 per month.
The MP also invests in industrial metals, valuing the investment at PLN 150,000. zloty.
Earlier, the asset declaration was also published by Jarosław Kaczyński.
Vote on adjournment for the Conservative Party conference
British MPs have voted against a three-day break in the House of Commons for the Conservative Party&#39;s annual program conference, which was requested by the government.
289 deputies voted for it, 306 against it.
It is customary for the House of Commons not to sit during party conferences, so that MPs do not have to forgo either party conferences or parliamentary sessions.
However, the opposition parties decided that in such a crucial time as the last weeks before the UK&#39;s planned exit from the European Union on October 31, parliament should not interrupt its sessions.
289 deputies were in favor of the government&#39;s request for a break, 306 were against.
Two opposition parties already after the conventions
The lack of consent to the break may be perceived as the opposition&#39;s political revenge on Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday the decision was declared unlawful and null and void by the Supreme Court) and for the fact that, after the judges&#39; ruling, no I want to apologize for her.
Following the ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, with Johnson&#39;s speech and the heated debate that followed being the highlight of the day.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.
“Now is the time to deliver Brexit.
It must be implemented in order to respect the result of the referendum.
Brexit must come so that we can deal with the agreement on citizens&#39; priorities, on health services, on the cost of living.
Brexit must be delivered so that we can unite this country,&quot; Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference is due to start in Manchester next Sunday and run until Wednesday 2 October.
Conferences of the two main opposition groups - the Labor Party and the Liberal Democrats - have already taken place.
One of Johnson&#39;s reasons for suspending parliament for so long was party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
&quot;President Andrzej Duda believes that the anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders,&quot; write foreign media.
The president&#39;s spokesman strongly denied these reports.
&quot;It&#39;s simply not true,&quot; Błażej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
Israeli media, incl. &quot;Haaretz&quot; and &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot;, citing &quot;Jewish Insider&quot;, write that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the Polish consulate in New York, stated that Israel was to blame for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who stated in February that &quot;Poles sucked anti-Semitism with their mothers&#39; milk.&quot;
Andrzej Duda said that he regretted that Israel did not apologize for the humiliating statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel, Marek Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an attacker who shouted: &quot;Pole, Pole.&quot;
“The quote is not only inaccurate.
It&#39;s just not true,&quot; wrote Błażej Spychalski on Twitter.
He stressed that Duda &quot;never said that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.&quot;
According to Spychalski, the portal &quot;invented it&quot;.
According to JI&#39;s interlocutors, during the meeting there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivor Edward Mosberg, awarded the Commander&#39;s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland, and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg allegedly agreed with President Duda&#39;s words and said that Jews from Israel &quot;like Israel Kac&quot; are responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to the sources of the portal, Boteach was supposed to interrupt Mosberg&#39;s statement.
Who is Banas and what is his fault?
A tenement house rented by pimps led the journalist to discover negligence in Marian Banaś&#39;s property declarations.
We summarize another scandal that shook the ruling camp.
Journalists of &quot;Superwizjer&quot; TVN revealed that Marian Banaś, president of the Supreme Audit Office, in recent years did not include a 400-meter tenement house in Krakow&#39;s Podgórze in his asset declaration.
What&#39;s more, his subtenant was supposed to run a sex business in the aforementioned tenement house (and thus rent rooms by the hour).
In turn, the building itself was allegedly from 2016 a collateral for the repayment of the loan.
The irregularities were pointed out by Bertold Kittel in the &quot;Superwizjer&quot; program.
The journalist revealed that the tenement house was rented from Banas by people associated with the criminal world to use it as a place of &quot;erotic meetings&quot;.
The clients were supposed to be men using the services of prostitutes.
Banaś answered the accusations vaguely and vaguely.
Interestingly, the tenement house rented by pimps led the journalist to discover negligence in Banaś&#39;s property declarations.
The tenement house itself was vaguely described in them, and the income from its rental was supposed to be underestimated.
“The assets of Marian Banaś and his wife may be worth between PLN 6 and 8 million.
In total, the spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings[...]”, writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banaś tenement house alone was worth about PLN 3 million.
The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is currently inspecting Marian Banaś&#39;s asset declarations for the years 2015–2019.
Banaś announced that he would suspend his activities at the NIK until its completion. &quot;I will apply to the Marshal for unpaid leave&quot;, he assured.
The opposition demands an explanation.
“We have not heard that the CBA has extended its investigation or accelerated the examination of Marian Banaś&#39;s asset declarations.
That is why we are forced to replace the state authorities and report the possibility of committing a crime [...]”, said PO-KO MP Mariusz Witczak.
&quot;If a normal Pole priced the rental of his real estate so grossly low, he would already have 10 inspections, tax surcharge and penal and fiscal proceedings,&quot; he added.
He went high, he fell low
Marian Banaś is the new president of the Supreme Audit Office.
He was appointed to this position on August 30, 2019, for a six-year term.
His candidacy was proposed by Law and Justice and accepted by politicians of this party.
Previously, Banaś was associated with the NIK in the years 1992–2005, he was active in this institution as a collaborator of Lech Kaczyński.
During the first rule of PiS (2005–2008), Banaś held the position of the president of the Customs Service, and also the undersecretary of state in the Ministry of Finance.
From 2015, he again sat on the stool of the head of the Customs Service, and from 2017, he managed the National Revenue Administration.
Banaś was the Minister of Finance in Mateusz Morawiecki&#39;s government for three months.

&quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot;: Ignoring the police officer&#39;s command will be punished
According to the newspaper, disregarding the order of a specific behavior issued by a police officer is to be a new type of offense, punishable by a fine, arrest or restriction of liberty.
The police unions want this change.
The idea was sent to the Parliamentary Committee on Petitions.
“The matter is serious, because more than half a million misdemeanor cases are brought to Polish courts every year,” we read.
&quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot; has established that the petition that the Independent Police Union is writing to MPs regarding the amendment of the Code of Petty Offenses has a chance of success.
The authors of the petition propose a new wording of Art. 54a of the Code of Offenses.
It would read as follows: &quot;Whoever does not comply with the request or order of a public official, issued within the limits and on the basis of the provisions of the Act, shall be punishable by arrest, a fine or restriction of liberty.&quot;
&quot;Par. 3 of this provision provides for the same penalty for those who, by not following orders, will prevent or hinder the performance of official duties.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told Rzeczpospolita that although he agrees with the main message of the proposed regulation, he fears that if implemented, it could be used in political demonstrations.
&quot;In the case of freedom demonstrations, this would be unfavorable and instead of alleviating the situation, they would actually exacerbate it,&quot; he adds.
According to the statistics provided by the newspaper, 86 percent. citizens positively assessed police interventions in 2018 and that every month the services undertake 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Buras worries about Europe
Jáchym Topol has writing in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
Father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war Czech playwrights, today listed in the same row as Václav Havel.
Therefore, Jáchym was cursed with talent from the beginning, which he tries to use.
After eight years, he returned with The Sensitive Man.
The main characters are Buras and Soňa with their two sons, who, however, do not form a typical Czech family.
They are itinerant actors, traveling around Europe.
He is a Shakespeare lover and a thief, she is a one-eyed interpreter who does not part with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys has not made a sound since birth, and for the other, time has stopped in infancy.
But it&#39;s not the characters that are the most important in this story.
All of them are just a background to observe the world in which there is no place for artistic nomads.
It is a world of a flea-infested province, a society of old, suspicious people and dissolute youth.
&quot;The Sensitive Man&quot; sometimes turns into an absurd theater.
The narrative imitates stage directions, and the characters&#39; conversations create this world.
The stage is Europe full of fears about its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines canceled 105 flights due to Thomas Cook&#39;s bankruptcy
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook collapsed, its Belgian branch Neckermann is still operational.
However, the company has problems.
Brussels Airlines has announced that it will cancel 105 flights in October due to issues surrounding Thomas Cook&#39;s bankruptcy, VRT has reported.
Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.
All tours with the office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to get a refund.
The court in Ghent also declared bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, approx. 12,000 Belgians stay abroad on trips purchased from Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, Thomas Cook Belgium spokeswoman Leen Segers said the company was now &quot;fully operational&quot; despite the UK parent company&#39;s bankruptcy filing, which caused concern among employees and customers.
At that time, the office reassured that customers who bought trips there would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook - the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world - declared bankruptcy on the night from Sunday to Monday.
The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse of last-minute talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.
Creditors demanded that, in addition to the £900m bailout already agreed in August, the company would raise an extra £200m as collateral for the winter, when travel agents tend to have lower turnover.
However, the company&#39;s problems had been mounting for several years, resulting in a debt of £1.6bn.

&quot;I don&#39;t think Slovenia played fantastic.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation per review
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion - such an unusual offer has been prepared for newcomers by German Görlitz.
The activities are intended to help fight the progressive decline in the city&#39;s population.
Görlitz is the easternmost city of Germany.
The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140,000 people a year. tourists.
However, as The Guardian writes, the city is struggling with significant problems.
Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.
The city is also struggling with a constant decline in the number of inhabitants.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, which translated into a decrease in the city&#39;s population by 25 percent.
In 2013, it amounted to 54,000 people.
Wanting to fight depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been submitted for the program.
Two-thirds of them were submitted by residents of large cities.
The program also attracted people from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and Great Britain.
“When we applied, we thought the program was to convince people to move to Görlitz,” said one project participant.
&quot;Now we feel it doesn&#39;t matter if we stay here after four weeks or not,&quot; he added.
The city has seven thousand vacant apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than the national average.
While the city government hopes some will relocate permanently, the main purpose of the program is to solicit feedback from program participants.
Information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
&quot;We want to find out more about what people need and, if they decide to move, what their motivation was,&quot; said program director Robert Knippschild.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to attract new residents by offering accommodation incentives.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in the US Tulsa, Oklahoma.
