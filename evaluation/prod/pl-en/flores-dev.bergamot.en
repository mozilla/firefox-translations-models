Under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, the first economic reforms were implemented.
China’s economy has grown 90 times since then.
Last year, China first exported more cars than Germany, outdoing the United States as the largest market in the industry.
China’s GDP could exceed the GDP of the United States in two decades.
The tropical cyclone Danielle, the fourth named cyclone from the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, formed in the eastern Atlantic.
Storm raging at a distance of approx. 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, peak wind speeds of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will grow stronger by Wednesday and become a hurricane.
Because the storm is far from the earth, it is difficult to assess its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.

Luckily, I wasn’t hurt, but I won’t forget this gruesome scene when people tried to knock out the windows to get out. 
People were banging in the windows with chairs, but the windows were made of unbreakable glass.
“One of the windows finally broke, so people started to go out the window,” said the survivor Franciszek Kowal.
Stars emit light and heat, consuming the energy generated by joining (or melting) of hydrogen atoms to form heavier molecules.
Scientists are trying to create a reactor that can generate energy in the same way.
However, the solution to this problem poses a lot of difficulties and many years will pass before a useful thermonuclear reactor can be constructed.
The steel pin drifts on the surface of the water due to the tension on the surface.
Surface tension occurs because the water molecules on its surface are more attracted to the water and air particles above them.
Objects such as the needle are able to float on the water surface thanks to the invisible coating that particles form on the surface of the water.
The flaming-of-the-art skate has two edges separated by a groove. Two edges increase the adhesion on the ice, even when they are angled.
The bottom of the blade is a bit bent, so when the blade tilts on one of the sides, the ridge that meets the ice also curves.
This makes the bucket make a twist. When the skates tilting to the right, the bucket makes a right turn, and if the skates tilt to the left, the skatere turns left.
To return to an earlier energy level, they must remove the additional energy obtained from the light.
They do this by emitting a tiny light molecule called a photon.
This process is referred to by scientists as “stimulused radiation emission” because atoms are stimulated by bright light, which results in the emission of photon of light, and light is a type of radiation.
The next image shows the atoms emitting photons. Of course, in fact, photons are much smaller than in this picture.
Photons are even smaller than the particles that form atoms!
Hundreds of hours of work cause the filament in the bulb to burn and the bulb stops shining.
It is necessary to replace the bulb. Caution should be exercised when replacing the bulb.
First, turn off the light or disconnect the cable.
This is because the current flowing into the frame, in which the metal part of the bulb is located, can seriously offend when the inside of the frame or the metal base of the bulb is touched, when it is partly in the frame.
The basic organ in the circulatory system is the heart pumping blood.
Blood is led from the heart, which are called arteries, and fed with “wires” called veins. The term capillaries refers to the smallest such “wires”.
The teething triceratopsa could crush not only the leaves, but also extremely hard branches and roots.
According to some scholars, triceratops fed on sagows, i.e. plants typical of the Cretaceous period.
This plant resembles a small palm tree with a crown created by sharp, protruding leaves.
A strong mouth could have been useful for triceratops when he wanted to get the leaves hit before he started eating the trunk.
Other scientists say these plants are very poisonous, so it is not possible for dinosaurs to eat them, although today sloths and other animals, such as parrots (dexed dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
How would the force of gravity on the moon Io work for me? Standing on the surface of Io, man weighs less than on Earth.
A person weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth will weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on the moon Io. The force of gravity is there, of course, much smaller.
The sun has no such shell as the Earth you can stand on. The sun is entirely from gases, fire and plasma.
The gas is thinned as it moves away from the center of the Sun.
The outer rim we see by looking at the Sun is called the photosphere, which literally means “ball of light.”
The phases of Venus, similar to the phases of the moon, were observed about three thousand years later (in 1610) Galileo, and used a telescope for this purpose.
The phases result from the fact that light reaches only one side of Venus (or the Moon), the one that is turned to the Sun. The Copernica theory, according to which the planets orbit the Sun, was confirmed in the phases of Venus.
Jeremiah Horrocks, an English astronomer, observed the transit of Venus a few years later, and precisely in 1639.
After the recapture, Danelaw Anglia experienced a long period of calm.
However, in 991, Ethelred had to face the Viking fleet, with which only the Guthrum fleet of a hundred years ago could equal in size.
The fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian whose ambition was to get rid of Denmark’s dominance over his country.
At first, Ethelred did not go on the battlefield, but managed to reach an agreement with Olaf, who returned to Norway and tried to regain his kingdom, albeit with varying success.
Hangul is the only specially invented alphabet that is in everyday use. It was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Seijong (1418–1450).
King Sejong sat on the throne as the fourth ruler of the Joseon dynasty and still enjoys great recognition.
In the beginning, he will refer to the alphabet hangul as Hunmin Jeongeum, or “correct sounds for teaching people.”
Many theories have been formulated about how Sanskrit was born, and one of them speaks of the migration of the Aryans who brought their language from the west to India.
Sanskrit is an ancient language that is considered to be the eastern equivalent of European Latin.
The first known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After developing the Sanskrit Ashstrash, he simply lost his meaning due to the hierarchy.
Sanskrit is an exceptionally complex and rich language from which many modern languages spoken in India, just as Latin is a source of European languages, e.g. French and Spanish.
After the French campaign, the Germans began preparations for the invasion of Britain.
The Germans called the attack “Operation of the Sea Lion”. Most heavy weapons and resources of the British army were lost while leaving Dunkirk, which is why the army was quite weak.
Nevertheless, the British Navy still surpassed the German navy (Kriegsmarine) by force and was able to defeat any enemy fleet that would affect the English Channel.
Few ships of the British Navy were on potential invasion routes because the admirals feared their sinking by the Germans attack from the air.
Let’s start by explaining Italy’s plans. Italy was primarily the “younger brother” of Germany and Japan.
Their army and navy were weaker, even though they built four new ships just before the war began.
Italy’s main targets were African countries. To take them over, they needed a launch platform for troops to cross the Mediterranean and to attack Africa.
To do this, they had to eliminate British bases and ships in Egypt from the game. Besides, the Italian warships had no other tasks.
Now it's time for Japan. Japan was an island state, just like the United Kingdom.
Underwater boats are vessels designed for a longer journey under the water surface.
The submarines were used during World War I and II. They were very slow at the time and had a limited range of shots.
At the beginning of the war, they traveled mainly on the surface of the sea, but with the development and greater radar accuracy, submarines were forced to go under the water to avoid detection.
German submarines were called the U-bots. The Germans perfectly dealt with the navigation and operation of submarines.
The Germans successfully used submarines and therefore, after the war, they did not want them to have too many of them.
- Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes called the "King of Tut" or "King of the Boy," is one of the most modernly famous kings of ancient Egypt.
Interestingly, in ancient times it was not considered important, it was not included in most lists of ancient kings.
However, when his tomb was discovered in 1922, he became a celebrity. Although many of the old tombs fell victim to robberies, this tomb was virtually intact.
Most of the items that were buried with Tutankhamun were well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made from precious metals and rare stones.
Thanks to the invention of the spoke wheels, the Assyrian chariots were lighter, faster and more effective in overshaling warriors and other chariots.
Shots from their deadly crossbows could pierce the armor of enemy soldiers. Approximately in 1000 BC. The Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
The cavalry is a military formation made up of armed horse riders. The saddle was not yet invented, so the Assyrian cavalrymen rode their horses on the bareter.
There are some famous Greek politicians, scholars and artists. Probably the most famous figure in this culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet who created two epic masterpieces of Greek literature: Iliada and the Odyssey.
Sofokles and Aristofanes are still popular playwrights, whose plays are seen among the greatest works in world literature.
Another famous Greek is Pythagoras, a mathematician, known primarily for his famous theorems about the relations of the sides in the rectangular triangles.
There are different calculations about the number of people who speak Hindi. It is estimated to be between the second and fourth most spoken language in the world.
Taking into account or excluding closely related dialects affects the determination of the total number of native speakers of a given language.
According to estimates, this language is spoken by 340 to 500 million people and as many as 800 million are able to understand it.
In Hindi and Urdu, the vocabulary is similar, but the letter is different; in everyday communication, users of both languages can usually communicate.
Somewhere in the 15th century, northern Estonia was under a very great cultural influence of Germany.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the local population, which is why they invented the literal Estonian language.
It was based on the German alphabet, but one sign was added: “A/A”.
Over time, a lot of words borrowed from German came together. This was the beginning of enlightenment.
According to tradition, the heir to the throne after graduation of school went straight into the army.
However, Charles went to the University of Trinity College of Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and then history, winning 2:2 (lower second degree).

The European part of Turkey (which includes Eastern Thrace or Rumples on the Balkan Peninsula) accounts for 3% of the country.
Turkey’s territory exceeds 1,600 km (1000 miles) long and 800 kilometers (500 miles) wide, has an approximately rectangular shape.
Turkey’s area including lakes stretches 783,562 square kilometers (300,948 square miles), of which 77,588 square kilometres (291,773 square miles) lies in Southwest Asia and 23,764 square kilometres (9174 square miles) in Europe.
The area of Turkey makes it the 37th country of the world in terms of the size of about the metropolitan size of France and the UK combined.
Turkey has access to the sea from three sides: from the west to the Aegean Sea, from the north to the Black Sea and from the south to the Mediterranean.
Luxembourg has a long history, but gained independence in 1839.
Today’s parts of Belgium belonged to Luxembourg in the past, but became owned by Belgium after the Belgian Revolution of the 1930s. The 19th century.
Although Luxembourg has always tried to remain neutral, it has not escaped the German occupation during the First and Second World War.

Every year around October, nearly 1.5 million herbivorous animals move in pursuit of rain from the northern hills towards the southern plains, crossing the Mara River.
And then again north, through the west, again through the Mara River, after the April rains.
The Serengeti region consists of the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Protective Area, the Tanzanian Wildlife Reserve and the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Learning how to create interactive media requires standard and traditional skills and tools learned during interactive classes (creating storyboards, editing films and sound recordings, storytelling, etc.).
To design interactively, you need to re-evaluate the assumptions about media production and learn to think non-linearnie.
In an interactive project, the elements must connect with each other, but they must also make sense as a separate whole.
The problem with the zoom lens is that the complexity and number of elements needed to achieve a specific focal length distance range are much larger than in the fixed focus lens.
This is a smaller and smaller problem as lenticular manufacturers are achieving higher standards in their production.
Thanks to this, zoom lenses can take pictures with a quality comparable to that obtained by lenses with a constant focal length.
Another downside of zoom lenses is the fact that the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is usually less.
Therefore, cheaper zoom lenses make it difficult to light if you don’t use a flash.
One of the most common problems when converting a video to DVD format is to adjust the image size.
Satisfaction of all customers is a key criterion in the production of most TVs.
Therefore, everything that appears on the TV screen had cut edges at the bottom, at the top and sides.
This ensures that the image is covered by the entire screen. This function is called overscan.
Unfortunately, when creating a DVD, its border will most likely also be truncated, and if the subtitles in the recording are too close to the bottom, they will not be fully displayed.
Tournaments, banquets and knights of the Round Table have long been elements of imagination inspired by the traditional motif of the medieval castle.
Even standing among the millennial ruins, you can easily recall the sounds and smells of long-broaded battles and practically hear the hood of the hooves on the cobbles, as well as feel the fear floating from the dungeon.
But is reality the building blocks of our imagination? Why did the locks start to be built? How were they designed and built?
The Kirby Muxloe castle standard for this period is a more fortified house than a real castle.
The large glazed windows and thin walls would not be able to resist a strong attack for too long.
In the 1980s, when Lord Hastings began its construction, the country was relatively peaceful, it was needed to defend only against small groups of migratory robbers.
The balance of power was a system in which European nations tried to maintain the national sovereignty of all countries in Europe.
According to this concept, all European nations had to thwart the rise of one nation into power, and therefore governments have often changed their allies to maintain an international balance.
The first armed conflict, which stood at stake, was the war for the Spanish succession.
This was a significant change, because the European powers would no longer have a pretext to wage religious wars. That is why the Thirty Years' War would be the last war that can be called religious.
The Temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on 21 July 356 BC as a consequence of Herostratus’s fire.
The story is that he sought fame at all costs. Outraged Ephesians announced that the name of Herostrates should be erased from human memory.
The Greek historian Strabo then wrote a name as we know it today. The temple was destroyed on the same night that Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander offered as king that he would cover the costs of rebuilding the temple, but his offer was rejected. Later, after Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE.
Make sure that your hand is as relaxed as possible, correctly hitting all the notes – try not to make unnecessary movements with your fingers.
That way you will avoid fatigue. Remember that you don’t have to press the keys harder to make the sound louder, as it is with the piano.

Mysticism consists in striving to unite or identify with ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth or God, or to attaining their full consciousness.
The believer seeks direct experience, intuition, or looks into the depths of the divine reality/deity or deities.
Followers lead a certain lifestyle or engage in practices that aim to nurture this kind of experience.

Sikhism is a religion that was born on an Indian subcontinent in the Punjab region in the 15th century as a result of a rift within Hindu tradition.
The Sikhs do not identify their religion with Hinduism, although they admit that it has Hindu roots and traditions.
The Sikhs call their Gurmat religion, which in Punjabi means “the guru way”. The guru is the basis of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism it is so important that it is the essence of the Sikh beliefs.
This religion was founded in the fifteenth century by Guru Nanak (1469-1539), and the successors include the next nine gurus.
However, in June 1956, Khrushchev’s promises confronted with riots in Poland, when workers’ demonstrations against food shortages and wage cuts turned into a protest against communism as such.

The Indus Valley civilization existed in the Bronze Age in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent, covering most of today’s Pakistan, as well as some regions in northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
Civilization flourished in the basins of the Indus River, from which its name originated.
Although there are scholars who suppose that because this civilization existed in the river basin today’s dry Saraswati River, it can also be called the Indusu-Saraswati Civilization, while other researchers use the name “Hranappan civilization,” referring to Harappa, the first settlement discovered in the 1920s. The 20th century.
The militaristic nature of the Roman Empire contributed to advances in medicine.
The first recruitment of the medics was initiated by Emperor Augustus and as a result, the first Roman medical corps was created to serve the soldiers wounded in battles.
Surgeons knew a variety of sedatives, including morphine obtained on the basis of extracts from poppy seeds and scopolamine from black barrel seeds.
They became accetic in amputation to protect patients from gangrene, as well as in the use of compression bands and arterial clamps to inhibit blood flow.
For many centuries, the Roman Empire has reached much in the field of medicine and influenced the knowledge we have today.
Origami of the Pureland type consists in the fact that only one bend is allowed at one time, do not make folded bends, e.g. bending and bending, as well as all bends must have a perpendicular position.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help people who don’t have experience in origami or whose motor skills are limited.
Children develop fairly early on the awareness of race and racial stereotypes, and these stereotypes affect behavior.
For example, children who identify with a racial minority, who, according to stereotypes, do not do well in school, usually do not do well when they learn about this stereotype.
MySpace is currently the third most popular site in the United States, covering 54 million profiles.
These websites attract great attention, especially in the educational environment.
These sites have their own positive aspects, including the ability to easily configure a class site containing blogs, videos, photos and more.
This page can be accessed by providing only one web address, making it easier to remember and type in students who may have spelling and typing problems on the keyboard.
This can be customized to make reading easier, as well as with any or a small amount of color.
The attention disorder “is a neurological condition, classically defined by the triad of symptoms: impulsivity, deconcentration, and hyperactivity, or over-energy.”
It is not a disability, it is a learning disorder that “affects 3 to 5 percent of children, maybe even 2 million American children.”
Children with ADD have a hard time focusing on learning, but they can focus on what gives them pleasure, e.g. playing games or watching their favorite cartoon or writing sentences without any punctuation.
These children tend to get into trouble, and this is because they “take up risky behaviors, get into fights and undermine authority,” to stimulate the brain because they can’t get this stimulation by normal methods.
ADD has an impact on relationships with peers who may have trouble understanding why someone behaves in such a way, why they write so, and why their level of maturity is different.
The ability to acquire knowledge and learning has changed in the manner described above, and the pace of knowledge acquisition has also changed.
The attitude to obtaining information was different. The pressure was no longer in individual memory, but the ability to invoke the text became more important.
Basically, the Renaissance has significantly changed the approach to learning and disseminating knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands to move, carry weights, or move between trees.
The hand and foot of the chimpanzees have a similar size and length, which shows that the hand is used to carry the weight of the body, when while walking they rely on bent fingers of the hand.
The human hand is shorter than the foot and has more straightened phalanges.
Fossilized hands bones two to three million years ago show how hand specialization has changed from movement to manipulation.
According to some, frequent evoking lucid dreams can lead to exhaustion.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that lucid dreams extend the time between the REM phases.
If less phases of paradoxical sleep occur at night, the low frequency of the condition in which you actually sleep and your body recovers.
It’s as exhausting as waking up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch TV.
The frequency with which the brain tries to dream consciously over a given night has an effect.
Almost from the beginning, the affairs of the Italians in North Africa did not go well. A week after the Italians declared war on 10 June 1940, 11 British Husars occupied Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
General Lastucci, the head of the engineering forces of the tenth Italian army, was captured by the British in an ambush east of Badriy.
On June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, the governor-general of Libya and the obvious successor of Mussolini, was killed by a fratricidal fire while landing in Tobruk.
Modern fencing is played on many levels, from students studying at universities to professional Olympic competitions and competitions.
Most often, this sport takes the form of a duel between two swordsmen.
Golf is a game in which participants use sticks to direct the balls to the holes.
In the standard round, eighteen holes are played, the players usually start from the first hole on the field and end at the eighteenth.
The winner is the one who has the least number of strokes or attacks with a stick.
The game takes place on the grass, which is shorter around the hole and is called green.
Recreation tourism is probably the most common type of tourism, most people associated with traveling.
It is then that people go to places that are completely different from what surrounds them every day to relax and have fun.
Beaches, theme parks and camping fields are usually the most popular places most often used by recreational tourists.
Cultural tourism means a type of tourism that involves learning about the history and culture of the places you visit.
Tourists can visit different distinctive objects of a given country or can focus on only one area.
Colonists, looking at this activity, also called meals.
The front-range troops consisted of the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire Regiments, numbering 200 people, led by Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both later became generals).
Stark's subordinates lined up along the fortification at the northern end of the position occupied by the Colonists.
When the drain opened a free passage along the Mystic River from the north-eastern side of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fortification with a short stone wall from the northern end at the shore on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark stabbed a peg at a distance of about 100 feet (30 m) from the fortification and ordered not to shoot until the adman crosses the line.
The American plan was to carry out coordinated attacks from three different sides.
General John Cadwalder will begin a diversion against the British garrison in Bordentown to block any support.
General James Ewing was to cross the river at Trenton Ferry along with a 700-strong unit of reunification, take a bridge over Assunpink Creek and thwart the escape of enemy troops.
The backbone of the attack consisted of a 2,400 armed squad who were to cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and split up, forming two troops, one under Greene's command, the other under Sullivan's leadership to launch an attack before dawn.
When the distance of the run changes from a quarter to half a mile, the speed loses its meaning, and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, a half-mile top runner, which can break two minutes, must have a sufficiently fast speed, but endurance should be taken care of at all costs.
Some winter cross-country runs, combined with training of the upper body parts at the gym, are the best preparation for the running season.
Proper nutrition does not guarantee excellent results, but can significantly affect the overall form of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, applying effective irrigation habits, and understanding the various aspects of supplementation can help athletes improve their performance and increase the pleasure of sports.
Distance runs is a relatively inexpensive sport, but there are many myths about several necessary pieces of equipment.
You can buy products as needed, but most of them will have a negligible or zero impact on performance.
Athletes may feel that they prefer a product, although it does not offer any real benefits.
An atom can be considered one of the fundamental elements that builds all matter.
It is a very complex unit that consists, according to the simplified Bohr model, from the central nucleus around which the electrons are located, somewhat resembling planets orbiting the Sun – see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus consists of two types of molecules: neutrons and protons.
In terms of electrical charge, protons are positive, electrons are negative, and neutrons have no charge.
To check what the victim is, you must first assess whether the place of the incident is not a threat to you.
Approaching the victim, keep an eye on its location, and also watch out for natural warning signals.
If you hurt yourself by trying to help, you'll only make things worse.
The study found that depression, fear, and pessimistic attitude were closely related to the pain and disability of people suffering from back pain.
Only the effects of catastrophic thinking depended on regular, organized weekly physical exercises, while such a relationship did not occur in the case of depression and fear.
People engaging in regular activity need more support when it comes to negative pain perception to distinguish chronic pain and discomfort from normal movement.
The vision, or the ability to see, is dependent on the organs of the sense of sight, i.e. the eyes.
The structure of the eye can be very different in terms of complexity, which depends on the requirements of the body.
Different systems are characterized by different possibilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and also differ in the degree of visual acuity, and in addition, they require different processes to interpret the input data, and the right number of organs to function optimally.
A population called a set of organisms of one species inhabiting a specific geographical area.
All individuals in the population in whom there is a specific phenotype are called monomorphic.
When individuals are characterized by several variants of a given feature, they are polymorphic.
Military ants march and nest in other phases as well.
During the journey, an army of ants marches at night and camps during the day.
The colony gives rise to the nomadic phase when the amount of available food has decreased. During this phase, the colony forms temporary nests that are changed every day.
Any such nomadic rally or march lasts about 17 days.
What is a cell? The word derives from the Latin “cella”, meaning “little chamber” and was coined by a researcher who was involved in observing the structure of the cork under a microscope.
Cell is the basic building block of all living organisms, which include at least one cell.
In fact, the role of cells in the study of life is so fundamental and crucial that they are often called “comparative elements of life.”
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses to the body so that blood flow is not disturbed.
These nerve impulses roam the body at such a speed that they help protect them from potential danger.
Tornados strike in a small area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy everything in their path.
Tornados rip the trees, rip the boards off the buildings and throw cars in the air. The most violent two percent tornadoes lasts more than three hours.
In these monstrous storms, the wind reaches speeds of up to 480 km/h (133 m/s, 300 mph).
For many thousands of years, people have been making and using lenses to see objects in magnification.
But the first real telescopes were built in Europe at the end of the 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to zoom in and enlarge the distant objects.
Greed and selfishness will always accompany us, and the essence of cooperation is that when most benefit, acting selfishly, short-term gains will be greater.
It is to be hoped that most people will open their eyes and see that working with others is the best long-term option for them.
Many people dream of a day when you will be able to travel to another star and explore other worlds; some wonder what is there, some believe that other planets inhabiting strangers or other forms of life.
But if that ever happens, it's not for a long time. Stars are located at great distances from each other, and the neighboring ones often share trillions of miles.
Maybe someday your great-grandchildren will be in an alien world thinking about their ancient ancestors?
Animals are made of many cells. They eat things and digest them. Most animals can move.
The brain is an organ that can only be found in animals, and not all, e.g. jellyfish do not have a brain.
There is no place on earth where there are no animals. They're drilling underground tunnels, swimming in the oceans, flying the sky.
Cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of living organisms (things).
The source of the “cell” is the Latin word “cella” meaning a small room.
Watching living things under a microscope, you can see that they are made of small squares or balls.
Robert Hook, an English biologist, looked at the cork under a microscope and saw small squares.
In appearance, they looked like rooms. He was the first person to observe dead cells.
Elements and compounds can pass from one state to another and not change.
Nitrogen in the form of gas still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. In the liquid state it is denser, but the particles are identical.
Another example is water, consisting of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
Molecular structure is identical to gas, liquid and solid.
Although the state of focus may change, the chemical composition remains unchanged.
Time is all around us, it affects all our actions, and at the same time it is so difficult to understand.
For thousands of years, time has been the subject of research of scholars, philosophers and theologians.
We experience time as a series of events passing from the future, through the present, to the past.
Time also serves us to compare the duration of events (their lengths over time).
You can mark the passage of time yourself by observing the relapses of a cyclical event, the distinguishing feature of which is regular repetition.
Today, computers are used to edit photos and video recordings.
Advanced animations can be created on your computer and are increasingly used for television and cinema.
Music is often recorded using advanced computers that process and mix sounds.
In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was long acknowledged that the first population of New Zealand was Maori, hunting for giant birds called moa.
According to this theory, the Maoris crossed the Great Fleet from Polynesia to New Zealand and took it from the Moriori people, after which they settled as an agricultural community.
However, recent evidence suggests that the Moriori tribe was a group of continental Maoris who moved from New Zealand to Chatham Islands and developed their own peaceful culture.
There was also another tribe on Chatham Islands, Maoris, which emigrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves Moriori, there were several clashes, and eventually Moriori were killed.
People who have been involved for several decades have made us see the value of our advantages and passions, and on the other hand, we could sincerely look at the difficulties and failures.
When we listened to people who told stories about their personal lives, family, or work, we got a lot of valuable information about the past and about personalities that had a positive or negative impact on the culture of the organization.
While understanding your history does not presuppose a cultural understanding, it at least helps you understand where we are in the history of the organization.
By assessing the successes and awareness of failures, individuals, as well as the entire group of participants, will get to know the values, mission and motivation of the organization better.
In this case, people opened up to new changes and a new direction for the local church, recalling entrepreneurial behavior and the resulting successes in the past.
Such stories about successes have mitigated the concerns of change, and at the same time inspired a positive attitude towards change in the future.
Troubleshooting methods using different concepts or fields to find a solution, called convergent thinking patterns.
Such mind attitude focuses on speed, logic, and accuracy, as well as the identification of facts, the re-use of available techniques, and the accumulation of information.
The most important element of this way of thinking: there is only one correct answer. You only take into account two answers – good and bad.
This type of reasoning is related to a specific science or standard procedures.
People with this type of thinking can think logically, memorize patterns, solve problems and scientific tests.
Humans are the most capable species when it comes to reading the thoughts of others.
It follows that we can effectively predict what other people perceive and intend to, what they believe, what they know and want.
The most important of these skills is understanding the intentions of others, because thanks to this you can solve possible ambiguities resulting from the actions performed.
For example, seeing someone breaking the window in a car, we would probably assume that they were trying to steal someone’s car.
He should be judged differently if he lost his car keys and tried to break into his vehicle.
MRI is based on a phenomenon called magnetic nuclear resonance (NMR), discovered in the 1930s. The 20th century by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (working at Harvard).
In this resonance, atoms emit delicate radio signals under the influence of magnetic field and radio waves.
In 1970, physician and scientist Raymond Damadian discovered how magnetic resonance imaging can be used for medical diagnostics.
Four years later, the patent was the first patent in the world in the field of magnetic resonance.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of a full-body magnetic resonance scanner, which he called "The Ungozy."
Asynchronous communication gives you time to think and respond to another person.
Thanks to this, students can work at their own pace and control the pace of instruction.
In addition, there are fewer time constraints, with the ability to work in flexible hours (Bremer, 1998).
The ability to use the Internet and the World Wide Web gives students access to information at any time.
Students can also submit questions to teachers at any time of the day and expect relatively quick answers instead of waiting for the next direct meeting.
The postmodern approach to science gives freedom from absolute truths. There is no good way to learn.
In fact, there is not one thing that should be learned from science. Learning is a process that happens as part of the experience at the interface between the person who is learning and the knowledge that is presented.
This is an exemplification of this is our current experience of TV shows, which present information, educate, teach and give practical advice (“do it yourself”).
Many of us watch on TV shows that convey knowledge that we will never use and show experiences that will never become ours.
We will never renovate the car, we will not put the fountain in the yard, we will not go to Peru to see the ancient ruins, nor will we rebuild the neighbor’s house.
Underwater fiber connections with Europe and broadband satellite services make Greenland provide good connectivity and 93% of the population has internet access.
Your hotel or hosts (in the case of accommodation in a guesthouse or private accommodation) will have Wi-Fi or a computer connected to the Internet, and there is an internet cafe in all facilities with public Wi-Fi.
As mentioned above, although the word “Eskimo” remains accepted in the United States, people outside the Arctic, especially in Canada, consider it offensive.
Although you will hear this word from the mouth of the native people of Greenland, foreigners should not use it.
Greenlandic indigenous peoples call themselves Innuit in Canada and Kalaalleq (l. Kalaallit, or "Grenlandic" in Greenland.

Each train always has MetroPlus and Metro carriages; Metro Plus is usually at the end of the train, closest to Cape Town.
Transferring the luggage of others – always keep an eye on your luggage, especially crossing borders.
It is possible that without knowing anything about it, you will be transporting drugs, which will end up with serious consequences for you.
This involves waiting in the queue, because dogs tracking drugs can be introduced at any time without notice.
Some countries impose extremely severe penalties even for the first offences, e.g. 10 years in prison or death.
Luggage left unattended is looted by thieves, and also draw the attention of the authorities who are afraid of bombing attacks.
At home, you’re still in contact with local germs, so there’s a good chance you’re already immune to it.
However, in those parts of the world where there are bacteria that your body has not been exposed to before, you are putting yourself at greater risk of problems.
Moreover, when the climate is warmer, the bacteria grow faster and are able to survive for longer outside the body.
Hence the plagues of Delhi Belly, the curse of Pharaoh, the revenge of Montuzema and others related to them.
While respiratory problems occur in cooler climates, in hot climates quite often there are intestinal discomfort, usually very annoying but not causing danger.
If you are traveling for the first time to a developing country or to a new part of the world, you can experience a culture shock.
Many regular, experienced travelers have been overcome by not knowing the travels around developing countries, where many minor cultural differences can accumulate quickly.
Especially in the first days, it is worth going crazy and spending money on high-quality hotels in the Western style, food and services to make it easier to acclimatize.
Do not sleep on a mattress or pad on the ground in areas where the local fauna is unknown.
If you are going to camp under the open sky, take a field bed or a hammock to protect yourself from snakes, scorpions and other dangerous animals.
Let your home be filled with a rich aroma of coffee in the morning and the relaxing smell of chamomile tea in the evening.
During your holidays in your place of residence, you have more time to please and make something really special.
If you are willing to go on an adventure, do not hesitate and prepare a few freshly squeezed juices or smoothies:
You may discover some simple drink that you will prepare for yourself during breakfast before you are consumed by your daily duties.
If you live in a city with a variety of drinking culture, visit bars and pubs in neighborhoods where you rarely go.
If someone does not know medical jargon, we would like to inform you that “infectious” does not mean the same as “contagious.”
The infectious disease is caused by a pathogen, e.g. a virus, a bacterium, a fungus or another parasite.
An infectious disease is an easily transmitted disease if you are close to an infected person.
Vaccines for various diseases are often a requirement for governments to people coming to or from a country.
These requirements can often be dependent on which you have visited or intend to visit a traveler.
One of the great advantages of Charlotte, North Carolina, is a great number of high-quality attractions for families.
Residents of other areas often say that the main reason for moving is the pro-family climate, and tourists often believe that it is easy to move with children in this city.
Over the past two decades, the number of child-friendly attractions in the city of Charlotte has increased significantly.
Families residing in Charlotte generally do not use taxis, although in some circumstances this form of transport may prove useful.
For the carriage of more than 2 passengers, there is a surcharge, so this may be a more expensive option than necessary.
The coldest place on Earth is Antarctica located around the South Pole.
Tourist trips cost a lot, require good physical condition, are possible only in summer (from November to February) and are limited mainly to the Peninsula, the Ross Islands and the Sea.
In the summer, about fifty bases in these areas are inhabited by several thousand employees, but only a small number of them spend the winter here.
Inland Antarctica is a depopulated plateau that covers 2-3 km of ice.
Occasional specialist air tours take place inland for mountaineering purposes or to reach the pole where there is a large base.
The route at the south pole (also called the highway) is a trail 1,600 km from the McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea to the pole.
After this snow with filled ice slots and marked flags, you can only move in special tractors pulling sleighs with fuel and food.
They are not light and manoeuvrable, so the trail on the long section circles the Transantarctic Mountains and leads further to the plateau.
In winter, accidents most often occur on slippery roads, sidewalks and above all stairs.
Shoes with a good sole are the basis. Summer shoes usually glide on ice and snow, and even some winter shoes may not be suitable.
The kernel must have a sufficiently deep cut-out, 5 mm (1/5 inch) or larger, and the material must maintain softness at low temperatures.
Some shoes are equipped with spikes, and in slippery conditions there is a spike pad matching most shoes, to wear heels or soles.
The heels must be low and wide. Better grip is achieved by scattering sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) on roads and paths.
Avalanches are not an unusual phenomenon; since steep slopes are only able to maintain a limited amount of snow, its excess will fall in the form of an avalanche.
The problem is that the snow is sticky, so something must cause it to go down, and the falling snow entails further masses.
Sometimes the original activator is the sun warming snow, sometimes greater snowfall, and sometimes other natural events, often a person.
The tornado is a spinning air pole with very low pressure, immersing the surrounding air to the center and up.
They cause strong winds (often 100-200 miles per hour) and can carry heavy objects into the air when the tornado moves.
They begin as funnels falling from storm clouds, and when they touch the ground, they become “tornados.”
VPN providers (virtual private network) are a great way to bypass political censorship and commercially filter IP addresses by location.
They outperform intermediary servers in several ways: they redirect all internet traffic, not just http.
Their typical advantages are higher bandwidth and better quality of service. Because they are encrypted, they make it difficult to spy.
Media companies are often lying when they target “preventing piracy.”
In fact, the region codes do not in any way affect illegal copying; a copy of all bits on the disk will be well played on any hardware on which the original will be played.
In fact, it is about greater control of these companies over their markets and generating large profits.
Conversations are carried out over the Internet, so you do not have to use the services of the telephony operator located at your place of residence or at the place of travel.
You also don’t need to get a local number from the community where you live; you may have a satellite internet connection in Chicken in the Alaskan deafness, and select the number assigned to the sunny Arizona.
It is often necessary to purchase a global number separately in order to be able to receive calls from phones in a publicly switched telephone network (PTSN). The location of the number does not make a difference for people calling.
Real-time text translation apps – applications that can automatically translate entire segments of text from one language to another.
There are applications in this category that can translate foreign-language texts placed on signs or other objects in the real world at a time when the user directs his smartphone to them.
Translation programs have improved significantly and now they often offer more or less correct translations (a rare text that doesn’t make sense), but be careful, as there is always a possibility of confusion.
Google Translate is one of the most popular applications of this type and allows you to translate offline after downloading the required language data.
GPS navigation on a smartphone is probably the easiest and most convenient way to move in a foreign country.
Instead of buying new GPS maps or a standalone GPS device, or instead of paying for them in a car rental, you can save and acquire your own navigation.
If you do not have data transmission enabled on your phone or your phone is out of range, the operation may be limited or unavailable.
On each corner you will find a shop with a chaotic prepaid phone card offer that can be used in phone vending machines or on regular phones.
Most cards are suitable for calling all places, but some offer favorable rates for calls to certain groups of countries.
Access to these services is often obtained through a toll-free phone number, which you can call for free from most phones.
The rules used for standard photography refer the same to video recording, perhaps to an even greater extent.
If photographing something is forbidden, don’t even think about filming it.
Before using a drone, see what you can film and what permits and licenses are required.
Even if the regulations in your area do not prohibit this, flying a drone in the airspace above the airport or a collection of people is fundamentally inadvisable.
Currently, it is rare to book air travel directly on airlines, instead first searched for and compares prices.
It happens that the same flight has extremely different prices depending on the flight search engine, so it is worth comparing the different results and checking the price on the airline’s website before booking is made.
Although a short tourist or business visit does not require a visa in some countries, if you come as a foreign student, the stay will probably be longer.
Generally speaking, a longer stay in some other country will require a visa in advance.
In the case of student visas, there are usually different requirements and procedures for submitting applications than with regular tourist or business visas.
In most countries, you will need an offer letter from the institution where you want to study, as well as a certificate of holding funds for at least the first year of the course.
Contact your immigration institution and department in the country where you want to study to explore the detailed requirements.
If you are not a diplomat, then when working abroad, you have a duty to file a tax return in the country where you are staying.
Income tax has a different structure in each country, and the rates and tax thresholds vary greatly from one country to another.
Income tax in some federal countries of the United States and Canada is imposed at both the federal and local levels, so rates and ranges may vary between regions.
When you return to your homeland, there is no immigration control, or it is only a formality, while customs control can be burdensome.
Be aware of what you can and cannot bring in, and report goods that exceed the permitted limits.
The easiest way to launch a travel writing business is to hone your skills on some popular travel blog.
Once you have mastered the rules of formatting and editing on the web, you can create your own website.
You can contribute to positive change by engaging in volunteering during your trip, but it’s not just about giving something of yourself.
Living and volunteering abroad are a great way to get to know a different culture, new people, yourself, and gain a new perspective and gain new skills.
It can also be a good way to expand your budget and allow for a longer stay in a place, as many volunteering offers accommodation and food, and some even a small salary.
The Vikings used Russian waterways to reach the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Some of these routes can still be used. Check if you don’t need special permits that may be difficult to obtain.
The Białorzeno-Baltic Canal runs from the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea through Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and St. Petersburg, using rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is connected by a canal with the Volga, so it is also possible to cross Russia today, leaving the Caspian Sea.
You can be sure that when you arrive at the marina, the situation is quite clear. You will meet other water hitchhikers who will share information with you.
In general, you will hang ads in which you offer help, walk around docks, talk people washing their yachts, try to establish contacts with sailors in bars, etc.
Talk to as many people as possible. Soon everyone will know you and they will tell you on which boat they are looking for someone.
A selection of an airline should be carefully selected for the Freequent Flyer Patcher as part of the airline alliance.
While you may think that you are driven by intuition when you choose the airline you fly most often, keep in mind that different benefits are often offered, and points for flying people are often larger in another line from the same group.
Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines are airlines that have significantly expanded its flight offer to Africa, and connections to many of the continent’s largest cities are available at more competitive prices compared to European airlines.
Starting in 2014, Turkish Airlines operates flights to 39 locations in 30 African countries.
If you have extra time to travel, check out the total price for travel in Africa compared to the travel price around the world.
Do not forget to consider the costs of additional visas, exit taxes, ground transport, etc. for all places outside Africa.
If you want to fly around the world only in the southern hemisphere, the selection of flights and destinations is narrowed due to the lack of transatlantic routes.
No airline alliance covers all three transoceanic flights in the southern hemisphere (SkyTeam does not cover any of them).
However, the Star Alliance does not only cover the eastern part of the South Pacific, from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which hosts LATAM Oneworld.
If you want to bypass the South Pacific and the west coast of South America, there are several other options available besides this flight (see below).
In 1994, the Nagorno-Karabakh region in Azerbaijan, Armenian, declared war on the Azerbaijanis.
With the support of Armenian, a new republic has been established, but none of the established state, including Armenia, officially recognizes it.
Diplomatic feuds about this area are still spoiling relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The Canal District (Dutch name: Grachtengordel) is a famous 17th-century district that surrounds Biennestad in Amsterdam.
The entire district was on the UNESCO World Heritage List in recognition of its exceptional cultural and historical value, while the prices of real estate located here are among the highest in the country.
The Cinque Terre, or “The Five Lands”, includes five small coastal villages (Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso) located in the Italian region of Liguria.
They are on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
For centuries, people have been meticulously building houses on uneven, steep land, up to the cliffs, from which there is a view of the sea.
Part of its charm is the lack of visible development. The villages can be reached by paths, trains and boats, but cars cannot reach them.
French-speaking people of Belgium and Switzerland use a slightly different variation of the language than the French, but these differences do not prevent them from communicating effectively.
Especially the numbering in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland has specific special properties that are different from those in French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of some words is different.
However, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss could learn at standard French school and they could understand you if you were using the standard French numerical system.
In many places around the world, waving is a friendly gesture that means “welcome”.
However, in Malaysia, at least in its rural areas, this gesture means “got” and resembles the one used in some Western countries when someone is invoked with an index finger – it should be used only for this purpose.
Similarly, a British tourist in Spain may wrongly recognize waving his hand directed at the waving (and not to the one to whom one is waving) as a gesture calling back.
Auxiliary languages are artificial languages or created to facilitate communication between people who otherwise would have a communication problem.
They are something other than lingua franca, which are natural or organic languages, dominating for various reasons as a means of communication between users of different languages.
During hot days, tourists may experience mirages that look like water (or other things).
This can be dangerous if the traveler follows the mirage, losing valuable energy and the rest of the water.
Even in the hottest deserts at night can be very cold. Hypothermia is the actual risk if you don’t have warm clothes.
Wandering through the rainforest, you need to watch out for mosquitoes, especially in the summer.
When you drive through the subtropical rainforest and open the vehicle door for a few seconds while boarding, mosquitoes are enough to become your passengers on the stroll.
Bird flu (properly knownviantvian influenza) can be infected by both birds and mammals.
Less than a thousand cases have been observed among humans, but some have been fatal.
Most cases concerned people working on poultry, but avians are also at risk.
Characteristic for Norway are steep fjords and valleys, which suddenly turn rapidly into a high, quite even plateau.
These platelets are often called “vidde” – this means a broad, endless space without trees.
In Rogaland and Agder, they are usually referred to as “hei”, which means a treeless wasteland, often overgrown with heather.
Glaciers are not motionless, they flow from the mountain. This will create cracks and crevices that can be covered with snow bridges.
The walls and ceiling of the ice cave can collapse, and the fissures can be knocked down.
On the edge of the glaciers, large blocks slide, falling and perhaps rolling further from their edge.
The tourist season at mountain stations usually peaks during the babiego period.
However, in winter they gain a completely new glow and charm, because in many mountain stations there is a lot of snow, so there are such attractions as skiing and snowboarding.
Only a few airlines still have funeral fares in their offer, slightly reducing the cost of a flight for the funeral bought at the last minute.
The airlines that have such an offer include: Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights from the USA or from Canada, as well as WestJet.
In all cases, a direct reservation is necessary by telephone contact with the airline.
