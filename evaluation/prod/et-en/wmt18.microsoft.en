Four members of the Kemerovo group detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the Postman, in Spain, the police detained Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the Estonian underworld, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovsky.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with the permission of the court.
Yesterday, the court also took three suspects detained in Estonia into custody.
According to the suspicion, these are members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal organization, aged between 27 and 57, who mainly commit drug crimes.
In Mijas, in the Spanish province of Malaga, the alleged leader of a criminal organization was detained.
Three men were detained as suspects in Estonia, one of whom, according to the data collected, is a leading figure in a criminal organization and two are members of a criminal organization.
The data collected suggest that roles and roles were clearly allocated within the criminal organisation.
The purpose of the activities of the criminal organisation was to commit drug crimes and thereby generate the proceeds of crime", commented the head of the pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case, state prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We do not rule out an increase in the number of suspects in this case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been in the interest of law enforcement in the past, and some of them have served sentences for drug crimes.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish counterparts has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of the cooperation," prosecutor Verte said.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said the detentions were preceded by a preliminary investigation that lasted nearly a year and a half.
"In the first half of the week, long-term work materialized and we simultaneously detained suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
Leis added that officers of the Central Criminal Police were instrumental in their detention in Spain.
For years now, we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and civil guards.
These detentions are yet another message to criminals that we can get them from the other side of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that while at liberty, suspected men can continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecutor's office requested their arrest and the court also approved it.
A man arrested in Spain faces his surrender to Estonia.
In this case, property, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial procedure in the criminal case is conducted by the Organised Crime Bureau of the Central Criminal Police and is headed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of extortion and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after the then underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich from Kemerovo rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s, when he began to engage in extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes who operated at various hotels and demanded a monthly roofing tax from businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscations of proceeds of crime and court rulings that have entered into force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest judgments, eight defendants separated from the criminal case of the so-called Dikayev criminal organisation, from whom the proceeds of crime were confiscated in the amount of EUR 80 000, or the judgment against nine persons in the fact that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal organisation in 2006 aimed at the illegal trade in smuggled cigarettes and the commission of crimes related to human trafficking in Ida-Viru county and southern Estonia.
The proceeds of crime confiscated there amount to nearly EUR 71 500.
What has ensured success in these cases is that police officers exchange information with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and prosecutors exchange evidence and, if necessary, act together in any country of the European Union.
Civil Rights Group warns against traveling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people traveling to Missouri against the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads, "The NAACP travel note issued for the state of Missouri, which is valid until Aug. 28, 2017, urges all African-American travelers, visitors, and Missourians to be particularly attentive and overly cautious as they move around the state, given the number of suspicious race-based events that have recently occurred across the state and have been outlined here."
According to the NAACP, the group was urged to issue a travel warning both by a recent Missouri law that makes it harder to win discrimination lawsuits, and by the fact that minorities are unequally targeted by state law enforcement officers.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are pulled to the side of the road because of the color of their skin, they are beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri branch of the NAACP, told The Kansas City Star newspaper.
"We've never gotten complaints so closely before."
This is the first such warning the organisation has issued about a US state.
The group cited events such as racist insults to black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died earlier this year under suspicious circumstances after he ran out of gasoline while driving through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with the crime.
In addition, the note refers to a recent report prepared by the Attorney General of Missouri, which shows that black drivers in the state are 75% more likely to stop cars than white people.
"The note is meant to make people aware and warn their families, friends and coworkers about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared, whether it's taking bail money or informing relatives that they're going through the state."
Based on the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, ranking the state 16th in the state's cross-section in terms of the number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also in response to Missouri's new law, which makes it harder for a company to sue for discrimination in search of housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel notes about Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because, according to the ACLU, it increases racial profiling.
Typically, travel warnings are issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently interest groups have begun to use this measure in response to certain domestic U.S. laws and trends.
Hepatitis: what could everyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, can be caused by five different hepatitis viruses - A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses provoke acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, the maladaptive course is chronic hepatitis B and C, which can progress to cirrhosis of the liver, i.e. liver wrinkling and liver cancer.
Kuulo Kutsar, epidemiology adviser at the Health Board, says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, grayish stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
From the last sign of the disease also comes the folk name jaundice of liver inflammation.
In children, hepatitis can proceed without signs of illness.
It is possible to determine the different types of liver inflammation only on the basis of data from laboratory studies.
Acute hepatitis can transition into chronic hepatitis and proceed for decades without any signs of the disease, which means that a person may not know anything about his dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Kuulo Kutsar highlights the different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in more detail.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, through sex, from the feces of an infected person to the hands and hands to food, surfaces, objects, getting into the mouth, and consuming drugs.
The risk group for contracting hepatitis A includes family members and caregivers of the infected person, people with chronic liver diseases, people who have sex with an infected person, men who have sex with men, drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented by vaccinating, in particular, vaccination is recommended for people who travel a lot and are at risk for hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to daily comply with the rules of hygiene: wash or disinfect your hands, wash all fruits and vegetables before using them for food.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread through contact with the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, piercings, using household objects contaminated with blood (toothbrushes, shaving products), donor blood, having sex with a person suspected of hepatitis, and from mother to fetus/newborn with hepatitis.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injecting drug users, sex partners of an infected person, men who have sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, family members and caregivers of a sick person, health, rescue workers and police officers who come into contact with blood and other bodily fluids, and travelers visiting countries with a high incidence of hepatitis B.
It is possible to vaccinate people for the prevention of hepatitis B; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people belonging to the risk group, as well as persons with chronic liver diseases, people with HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: refraining from using foreign hygiene and manicure products, other sharp devices and syringes-needles, tattooing and piercing, and using a condom in case of sex that is at risk of infection, or avoiding sexually risky behaviors.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation schedule in Estonia and is free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread through contact with the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, piercings, using household items contaminated with blood, donor blood, having sex with a person suspected of hepatitis, and from mother to fetus/newborn with hepatitis.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug users, sex partners of an infected person, men who have sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, family members and caregivers of a sick person, health, rescue workers and police officers who come into contact with blood and other bodily fluids, persons infected with HIV, and travelers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis C.
Preventive measures for hepatitis C include: refraining from using foreign hygiene and manicure products, other sharp devices and syringes-needles, tattooing and piercing, and the use of a condom in case of sex that is prone to infection.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which multiplies in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
As a result, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses are transmitted through contact with blood and other body fluids, syringes-needles contaminated with them, sexually and rarely from an infected mother to the fetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have immunity to hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects a person from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses are transmitted through fecal-oral routes through drinking water and food, including when eating little-cooked beef, fish and seashells, donor blood, shared syringes, and from an infected mother to a fetus.
Travelers can become infected in countries with high levels of hepatitis E.
Preventive measures for hepatitis E include compliance with hygienic requirements: wash or disinfect hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for a sick person.
Wash fruits and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating little cooked beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water, and refrain from drug use.
Although on the final lap, rivals tried to push the four-time Olympic champion off the track, the 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final round and won with a time of 26:49.51.
Farah didn't think long, pulling his wife Tania and children with him to the track after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
Being on track with them was wonderful," Farah told reporters.
Farah is targeting the golden double of the 5000 and 10,000 metres run for the fifth title race in a row in London.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie dives into O'Connor's "The Lady in Gold." The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer" from the story of the birth of a work of art to the cultural life of Vienna in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
But even more thoroughly into history.
The awe-inspiring amount of information would have been worn out by perhaps a harder axe of cuts, a narrower theme would have allowed the extraordinary story of the portrait promised in the title to have more impact.
At the moment, it is as if there were two books between the covers: the story of Gustav Klimt and Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted in his painting The Lady in Gold, and a much more voluminous and comprehensive history book about respected Jewish families and the German occupation with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book leads in the midst of the bustling Viennese cultural life, and whoever got into the Austrian capital himself can imagine without the slightest how life went around Ringstrasse more than a hundred years ago, or how everyone turned their heads in Central's café when Klimt walked in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities in Europe, and when you see the familiar name in the book, you feel as if you are a gram more cultural.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud operated in a city where incurable syphilis proliferated and had the highest suicide rate in Europe seems to add nothing to the development of the story.
Or perhaps still - each brushstroke of a couple of sentences also adds colors to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
The dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost every tenth resident of Vienna was Jewish.
Adele's parents were also newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch, who opened up twice, and posed for Klimt for his famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adele was not drawn to all this glamorous life to which she belonged.
If you look at the "Lady in Gold", it is difficult to believe that towards the end of her life this noble lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of his wife from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimt's order cost Rs 4000 crore at the time, a quarter of the price of a well-located country house.
The fact that in some portraits the master's love affair with the model was suspected did not discourage the sugar magnate.
As for Adele, the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist, which arose during the work, continued until the end of life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "The Lady in Gold.
The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer", Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Just before the start of work with Adele, Klimt had visited the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, and investigators think that it was there that the brilliant mosaics of Empress Theodora, seen there, gave the artist the idea to make a golden portrait of Adele in the form of a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Lady in Gold" in Vienna in 1908, and around the same time (between 1907 and 1908) another golden painting, "Kiss", was born.
Art historians did not miss the similarity between the two women.
How is Hitler related to the story?
"I think that in memory of my friend Klimt, I owe him a debt to make his handiwork available to the public," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote to the director of the Belvedere Museum a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) and wanted their family's Klimt collection to go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had completed another portrait of Adele.
Also in her will (Adele left in February 1925), she asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four landscape paintings by Gustav Klimt to the Austrian Gallery.
He bequeathed his jewelry to his nieces Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt had graduated from the "Mona Lisa of Austria", 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to get into the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, but failed the drawing exam.
Although hitler's later anti-Semitism is sometimes attributed to the fact that he was not accepted into the academy by Jewish professors, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
Anyway, by 1939, the task of the Austrian Gallery, referred to in Maria's testament, had changed markedly - it had become important to find works to the liking of the Nazi Party from the rich Jewish art collections in Vienna.
Some of Adele's homework was also suitable for Hitler's personal art treasure, but not Klimt's.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robberies, a ten-year litigation began between the Austrian government and the heirs of the Bloch-Bauers.
At this point, it should only be noted that while "The Kiss" is seen at Belvedere Castle in Vienna, "The Lady in Gold" depicting Adele Bloch-Bauer is to be seen by driving to New York's Neue Galerie.
And before the trip to Vienna, read the aforementioned book as well.
Even if you don't plan on going to see Klimt's work, because at least my emotions revolved around a more Nazi and Jewish theme after the book closed than a painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer sold for $135 million.
Thus, not so much a portrait, but rather a story of the fate of a family - and a very touching story.
Noticeably, orientation in events was facilitated by the Bauer family tree, which was mentioned at the beginning of the book.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In the preliminaries, Gold was very close to his personal record in the 200m backstroke by swimming in 2:16.62.
The top mark dates back to the 17-year-old's time a week ago when he finished with a time of 2:16.58 at the Canadian Junior Championships, according to Priit Aavik's Swimming Blog.
Gold made it to the A-finals last, the tenth.
In the final, he completed the distance with a time of 2:15.76 and finished a good seventh with a powerful new top mark.
From the Estonian record held by Alina Kendzior (2.15,13), Gold was separated by just over half a second.
In Estonia's all-time rankings, Gold rose to third, and his new personal top mark is Estonia's fifth-ever result.
The youngster is still taking off at the Canadian Adult Championships in the 100m, 200m and 400m freestyle and 200m and 400m individual medleys.
The Canadian Junior Championships were held in Toronto last week, and Gold made successful starts there as well.
She won the silver medal in the 200m freestyle with a time of 2:03.22.
That's how fast this distance was last swam by an Estonian woman in 2008.
Only Estonian record woman Elina Partõka has swam this distance faster than Gold in Estonia.
The Estonian, who lives in Canada, also won the bronze medal in the 100 m freestyle with an excellent personal record and a new Estonian season's top mark of 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older than her, has swam this distance just one hundredth faster.
She reached her personal top mark in the 100m backstroke with a time of 1:03.69 in the opening exchange of the relay swimming.
In the half-distance, she only finished seventh when she swam in the final in 2:17.31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season rankings in four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpen teeth
The holiday season is here - it also means relaxation for US President Donald Trump.
However, with Trump having been one of the most vacation days out so far as president, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president's plan is to spend a 17-day vacation at the eponymous golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the president's vacation began yesterday, Trump's opponents have been speaking out about the holiday for weeks now.
They accuse Trump of resting too often.
Notably, it is customary for the president to spend time on weekends in his villas in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
Incidentally, Trump is not the most rested president in his 196 days in office.
George W. Bush, for example, was already on vacation for 67 days during that time, while Barack Obama was half as many as Trump, just 21 days.
However, Trump tends to quickly forget things.
Days after becoming president, Trump said on the "60 Minutes" show that there would be no time for long vacations during his tenure because there was a lot to do.
He also expressed outrage three years ago over Barack Obama's vacation.
The current president wrote on Twitter at the time: "While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, attending parties and jazz concerts, ISIS is chopping off journalists' heads".
White House officials say a 17-day visit to a golf club is not really a relaxation.
Instead, it's officially referred to as a work vacation during which Trump doesn't have time to read or engage in any other pleasurable activities.
In addition, there had to be another reason for working leave.
Namely, in the west wing of the White House, the air conditioning system is being replaced, and therefore all staff had to leave.
The west wing also houses the Oval Office and other presidential offices.
"I don't think any of you would want to be in the west wing in August if it's 38 degrees and there's no air conditioning," said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president would continue to work during the holiday.
You can get an idea of where President Trump will spend the next 17 days in the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook don't run for public office if you can't stand criticism from voters
The father of our country knew a lot about the unfavorable media coverage.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to start scolding him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism, of course, annoyed him.
But he did not force his critics to remain silent.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "freedom of speech may be taken away from us, and dumbly and silently we may be led to massacres like sheep."
That brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to struggle to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And earlier in the week, he was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
The governor's official staff tamped the lawsuit as null and void, and online commentaries were riddled with backlash in the style of "Who cares?".
"It's just Facebook," many said.
But it does.
And that matters a lot when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is an astonishingly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state.
His approval percentage ranks second best among the country's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a thoughtlessly responsive throbbing head.
He has led the state with a firm hand and remained strictly true to his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook quite adept at communicating with his constituents as the main tool, presenting his bald head hilariously for the first time after chemotherapy, for example.
Thus, the governor's page, which is a public forum with official markings, is managed by staff paid from taxpayers' dollars to block people visiting and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's behavior in an interview with The Washington Post, arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it's all too easy to paint a picture of internet trolls, spammers, or anger-filled people cringing the web.
The Post chatted with several real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And that's exactly what they're real people who interact with their elected leaders. Teacher, business owner and pastor, not internet trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not at all obscene.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasizing Hogan's Catholicism.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, an attorney from Bowie, Maryland, did not incite hatred, but about real hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed because he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in a commentary section of The Post's news story.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same issue, some immediately indifferently call it a collective effort, rather than acknowledging that they are a large number of concerned citizens."
What the governor's office called a "targeted spam attack" would presumably be called "public support" by others.
The Facebook era makes it easy to match messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than it used to be, when the same thing had to be done by sending out workers to collect newspapers with critical editorials and burn them, or arrest protesters and force them to remain silent.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for toothless Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first landmark judgments on the subject was delivered last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that the chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment to the Constitution by blocking a voter from his Facebook page.
In Kentucky, the ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin, R, for using Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
Under Washington, affordable postage had a similar effect as the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous letterwriters taunted his manner of leadership.
And even then, Washington had to contend with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, making Washington's decisions.
According to historical documents collected as part of an online George Washington letter-collecting project, his cabinet was buried under petitions criticizing his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he didn't force them to remain silent.
Freedom of expression, dissent and debate are the foundations of our country.
And proper leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for the comfort of a home territory at the Renaissance Club
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty is counting on the comfort of his home territory over the next three days when the 25th edition takes place at the Renaissance Club golf courses in East Lothian. Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who was leading the way on the neighbouring Archerfield Links tracks last year ahead of the final lap before giving up to Paul Eales, is fond of the new venue and will take on the role of tournament ambassador in place of the club's founder and CEO, Jerry Sarvad.
"I saw the Renaissance Club being built, and now we're seeing the club shine in full glory with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players see the track at their best, it's in a brilliant state.
Jerry has done a great job of building this place.
He is an avid supporter of the game of golf and is proud of what he has achieved here.
It makes it a great showcase for the track."
The Englishman is looking forward to defending the championship for the first time, although the man has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a very special feeling," said the player who nests at Southport.
"I couldn't defend my Extremadura Open title because it was taken off the competition calendar a year after my win.
It's magical to come back to that place.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember memories from last year, for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will forever carry in our hearts."
On domestic soil, Gary Orr, who joined the Senior European Tour earlier this year when he turned 50, will also return to the competition again.
It is his first event in Scotland since participating in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It's always a little more meaningful to play at home," said Orr, a Helensburgh man.
"You want to perform well, but at the same time, you also feel the extra stress.
I've enjoyed playing again immensely and shown quite a decent game of golf.
I'm happy with how things are going so far."
Former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and senior tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty will join the trio on the field.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the race, the rest of them being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, and parking a car costs £5 for a car with one passenger and £10 for a car with two or more passengers.
All proceeds will go to the charity Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's gold-rich land
When Bardina Degei prepares dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
He even rarely uses a pot.
In a wooden hut in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai regency of Indonesia's reluctant Papua province, a housewife places a sweet potato called nota in the local language directly on the fireside.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is taken from the heat and eagerly pierced into the skin with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the muddy floor with no furniture, and right there she also does her daily chores, such as washing laundry with turbid water from a nearby swamp.
The role of a toilet is performed by a bucket in a room without a roof.
Since he is the youngest of his wife's four wives, he is not destined to take care of any field.
Polygamy is common here.
However, working late can be dangerous most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many of them drink hard, in addition, there are still soldiers here.
"No one dares to go around the village after five o'clock in the evening," he says.
This is a rare glimpse into life in the Papua Highlands. It is a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which only 1026 elderly people were forced to vote by raising their hands before the eyes of the occupier's troops.
The movement, which instigated the liberation of the Dutch from domination, quickly directed its rage against the Jakarta government, which still keeps the region under its strong control, keeping away foreign journalists and human rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, so that independent Papua New Guinea retained the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is both a remote and an abandoned place alike. To get here, you have to fly 90 minutes to Nabire from jayapura, the capital of the province, and then complete a nauseous five-hour journey in a rental car.
There is no public transport.
The town of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered by wavy iron roofs, the rust of which has turned into yellowish-brown in various shades.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and there have been almost no foreigners here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuans of me Pago worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing clothes like that," Degei says, referring to her colorful hand-woven turban, dark blouse, and bright skirt.
"Before that, we only wore plant leaves on the body."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28% of people living below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are among the worst in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's gold-rich country.
Just 100 km from Paniai, a mountainous province roughly the size of New Jersey with a population of 153,000, lies Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about US$3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua can boast of supplies of consumer timber, estimated at USD 78 billion.
However, these riches are the source of the suffering of the Papuans, as they lead to the suffocating presence of a powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study by The New York Times found that Freeport paid approximately US$20 million to local military and military units between 1998 and 2004, including up to US$150,000 per officer.
The Papuans' efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are mercilessly handled.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the highlands belonging to Papuan tribes in the 1970s were the measure of genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful protesters in the area.
The 2016 "We Lose All" report by the Archdiocese of Birsbane includes testimony of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial killings, torture (rape and electric shocks are particularly common, according to another report) and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because such incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian investigator at Human Rights Watch.
The screws have been tightened even more strongly as Papua's natural resources have caused an influx of new settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's crowded islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese family canteens sell gado-gado with crispy chicken and mixed vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
The locals are not able to compete with them.
"Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables at a traditional market cheaper than local Papuans," explains Paniai-born Abeth You, a 24-year-old who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital, for work.
"Native Papuans papuan mama-mama'd [women] are losing their market share as a result."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed in his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua.
The former carpenter won 27 of Papua's 29 constituencies, including Paniai, on his way to Jakarta's presidential palace.
But very little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokow in the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes of restoring justice," You says.
In fact, just two months after Jokow took office in October, Paniai was struggling with a slump.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children were singing Christmas carols by a campfire in Enarotal when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle out of darkness.
The horrified children told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, intoxicated soldiers chased children and beat them with the handles of their rifles.
One of the soldiers then shot among the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulian Yeimo, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby election commission building was set on fire, and the next day things escalated further.
About 1000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance of the Papuan honey pago tribe, during which they ran around and mimicked birdsong.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military personnel.
In the exacerbation of outrage, an order was sent to the soldiers through the internal radio. "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them," the official document said, which has been seen by TIME magazine but has not been issued to local media outlets.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, a senior in the Kego Koto district of the city of Enerotal, sensed a looming threat and called for peace to be maintained by asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," he told TIME magazine in his bright colors on the porch of a wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
"There were a lot of people, there were plenty of shots," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times by a cousin who witnessed his shooting.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name, told TIME magazine grimly.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates only ensured the safety of his division because it was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves if we are threatened with killing," Papua police spokesman Commissar Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and there were numerous injured.
The news of the killings did not reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed condolences to the victims' families and vowed to deal with the abuses that took place in Papua.
"I want to resolve this case right away so it never happens again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would put in place an out-of-court mechanism to address human rights crimes that had taken place.
But almost immediately, apologies also followed.
"Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The thing is, we are committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes," he said.
However, speaking to TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, Wiranto withdrew his words, saying he had no intention of creating a mechanism in Papua to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said, "everything will be settled by law."
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights in connection with the deaths of more than 1000 people in East Timor during the bloody 1999 independence referendum, said 11 crimes against human rights had already been solved in Papua, including in Paniai.
The families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with gloomy distrust.
"I've been interrogated four times in the last three years, but there hasn't been any progress," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
He says he's still living in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people of Paniai are afraid to dissect this incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the military came looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Deiyai, a neighboring province of Paniai.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when he went into a fight between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
This man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned in a nearby river while fishing, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to police, villagers stoned police officers, on which the latter responded with warning shots.
But according to locals, a mobile brigade (Indonesian militarized police) began firing at the crowd, killing one person.
"We were in a big panic, we're afraid of retaliation," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injuries being worn, told TIME magazine.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
Deiyai's parliament has called for the police officers involved to be held accountable and for the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problematic place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the honey, moni, dan and Damali tribes living in the verdant central highlands of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL) rebel army, which they say defends the rights of Papuans by carrying out sporadic attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the VPL leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, the military, under the pretext of 'defending the sovereignty of the country', has arrested Paniais in recent years and arbitrarily detained thousands of people.
Some of them will never show up again.
Among the Papuan people, Pania is known as a "tragic forgotten place."
Poverty feeds discontent.
The scarce rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is just as inaccessible.
People grow all their food on their own mainly sweet potatoes, in addition to a little fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can maintain four or five sweet potato fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest to the family, the rest selling at the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between indigenous Papuans and new migrants have deepened, who have been plentiful since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist go better for educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuans themselves often lack the capital or the necessary skills to run a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there are neither jobs nor money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, severe restrictions remain on foreign media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua for "not observing relevant practices", even though they had been granted a rare filming permit.
Phelim Kine, deputy head of Human Rights Watch's Asia department, said Jokow's election promises to lift restrictions on reportage to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
"Journalists trying to report from the most turbulent provinces of Papua in Indonesia and West Papua face new threats from visa rejection and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of a drilling gaze from the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to Papua's closest neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states in Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "a wide range of large-scale crimes" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These same countries have historically also supported the VPL.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's accusations, telling reporters in Jakarta: "Indonesia still has democratic order and freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to bury evidence in human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note.
When an official Dutch delegation, led by the country's human rights envoy Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence, according to a source who was present at the meeting but wished to remain anonymous, urging: "We want freedom."
Indonesia will hold new presidential elections in 2019, but the Papuans don't believe they will vote for Jokow again.
"Jokowi is a well-intentioned man, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai," says Hobai, chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants to suggest to Jokow that in addition to the fact that the people of Paniai are constantly living under threat from the predatory military, they are suffering from misery due to poor education and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, consider their vote given to Jokow to be a debt that he has to pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting managed to cope with one last symbolic rebellion they buried the body of one of the victims in the land opposite the police station and military base.
Knowing that justice may never be done, at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," Yacobus says with his head lowered.
"What else could we do?"
Fire engulfed Dubai's Torch skyscraper for the second time
The fire swept through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee that 337-meter-high, 79-story structure.
This is the second fire that has devastated a tall building in just two years, which happens to be called the Torch, or Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and no direct cause of fire was reported.
"We slept and woke up to a fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," one resident, who called himself George, told Reuters.
Dubai civil protection officials said firefighters extinguished the flames at about 4:00 a.m. local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world.
During an investigation conducted by the Torch board in the wake of the 2015 fire, it was found that the façade coating - decorative panels and insulation of the exterior - suffered the most damage.
British police have said they believe the insulation and façade panels at London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June that killed around 80 people.
Look: These phones will probably become sales hits in the fall
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, as then phone makers unveil their new top models.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium went on sale in the spring, with new hit phones also expected on store shelves in the fall.
According to Kristjan Seema, Marketing and Sales Director at Tele2, this year's flagships are characterized by an innovative design, an eye scanner, an edge-to-edge 4K resolution display and an ultra-fast processor.
Great excitement was aroused in the world of technology by the Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the top of the sales ranking of Estonian smartphones.
Autumn promises even more agile fast charging, a more durable battery, a higher-quality camera and greater water and dust resistance for smart enthusiasts.
He added that based on rumours, one can already make assumptions and predict the four top models that will probably conquer this year's sales rankings.
These four top smartphone models will hit store shelves later this fall.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should arrive on store shelves as early as mid-September.
However, rumors about what the new Apple model will look like and what can be done with it are spreading a lot.
If the iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences next to the iPhone 6s, then on the occasion of Apple's tenth birthday, it is expected that the new model will fully stand out from the previous ones.
Four colours have been talked about: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is probably the screen that covers the entire front panel of the phone, the home button is lost, and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
Apple's head of design, JonyIve, insists that the new iPhone model looks like smooth glass.
There has also been talk of a ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to the eye-catching scanner, wireless charging and an even higher quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
It's definitely one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
Pre-ordering for the brand new Galaxy Note 8 will begin on August 23.
There have been a lot of rumors leaked about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It is rumored that even more business users are meant, and the S Pen allows for even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one of which is a wide angle and the other a telephoto lens with a narrower field of view.
At the moment, no one yet knows what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is samsung's first test, which is definitely comparable to the iPhone 8 in terms of quality.
However, we are looking forward to August 23rd.
While Nokia has launched three smartphones led by the Nokia 6 this year, their flagship is still missing - the Nokia 8, which will be unveiled as early as August 16.
We expect a 5.3-inch edge-to-edge display from Nokia and an ultra-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of an aluminum body and a remarkable degree of water and dust resistance IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia's new model has two rear cameras, the optics of which are produced by the company Zeiss.
While Sony's solid flagship has been the XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones with even more innovative features will be added in the near future.
We're waiting for a smartphone that's a little more modest than the XZ Premium, but with at least as good or better a camera.
There has been speculation about Sony's new model that its screen will be at least six inches.
What reality brings, we will see very soon, because traditionally Sony has unveiled its autumn flagship at the international technology fair IFA, which this year will take place from September 1-6.
According to leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post released transcripts of phone calls between United States President Donald Trump and mexican and Australian leaders.
On Jan. 27, Trump went on a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly announcing that he wasn't going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The American president cracked with him for publicly condemning the wall, saying, "You mustn't tell the press."
Trump set his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore he would make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published, revealing a tense exchange of views.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal under which the United States would take on refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous," "nagging" and "stupid." He argued that a deal made during the Obama administration would give him the impression of a "jerk" because he has proposed a ban on resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump ended the call by telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant call of the day."
The Supreme Court did not hear the complaint of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in a case where the city of Tartu rejected their tender for the procurement of regular bus transport from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a decree rejecting the tender of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid for the procurement of buses in Tartu, as the tender did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, head of the Legal Service of Tartu City Government.
This is a procurement for public bus transport within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP Linna Liinid appealed the decision of the Tartu District Court to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court did not hear it.
While many on social media complain that the noise coming from the Weekend festival is disturbing their night's sleep and the whole city is full of drunk partygoers, there are also many who don't have a single bad word to say about the festival on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the partygoers in the store were so polite!
I didn't see any fuzzy being or rudeness.
I even saw kindness," says the loverly Laine.
"It's great to come, be and enjoy Pärnu, which is like hibernation in winter," he adds cheerfully.
The throbbing Laine coming from the beach doesn't bother her sleep.
If while living in the city center he still heard that music was being played on the beach, now the music has not yet reached the walls of his home.
"But I hope I hear," he says cheerfully.
Agnes, who spoke to Õhtuleht, also says that the big festival is rather good for Pärnu - after all, it contributes greatly to the turnover of local merchants.
In addition, he is glad that so many expats have come to visit the summer capital.
The mellowness of the partygoers does not interfere with the woman.
Even though I don't sunbathe on the beach anymore, it's nice that the beach has come to life.
And it's great that the crowd is moving and it's been that way three times already," she says.
The first time, I guess it was a little worse.
"Then maybe there were complaints," he ponders.
However, according to him, the fun on the beach is common for summer residents.
"This Weekend is a very good promo for our little town," says Harri, who basks in the park.
The mellowness and tumult haven't kicked into the oscillation of his rhythm of life either.
But for what?!
We should all stick together.
Think about how this interethnic interaction would be better.
Loud music doesn't devastate a man.
It doesn't interfere, although I live right there nearby.
"Good people can stick together and there's no mischief," he says.
Guests who come to Pärnu, he said, are polite.
"With the bottles, of course, they've exaggerated a little bit, but young people are young and lord god — give it a go, but be human and we'll get it done!" he says.
Beachside residents have traveled somewhere away by then, whether to relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive effect on life – people like this kind of fun," says Tiina, who has been walking with children in Pärnu.
His family's sleep isn't disturbed by festival music either, although last year it sounded even further away from this year.
Last summer, the stage was the other way around, then we heard more.
We live outside the city ourselves, so it's actually quite good to hear it far away on the Pärnu River," he says.
Pearson cuts another 3000 jobs and reduces dividends to revive business
British education company Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3000 jobs and cut its interim dividends by 72 per cent, thus launching another restructuring programme to address the business's looming predicament.
The jobs to be lost, which will most likely be laid off in late 2018 and early 2019, according to CEO John Fallon, will be added to the 4000 positions lost during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced plans in May to cut spending by an additional £300 million (US$394 million) as part of a third cost-cutting programme to try to revive a business that has been hit by a rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell a stake in Penguin Random House last month to its partner company Bertelsmann, said their expectations for the year have not changed since a 1 percent increase in revenue to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year was reported.
On Sunday, the warm weather in summer will continue with rainstorms
In Estonia, the summer with the possibility of thunderstorms on Sunday will be warm, and wind gusts will be very strong at times.
At night, the weather in Estonia is cloudy with clearings.
In many places it rains in the yard, there may be thunderstorms.
Blowing southwest and westerly winds 5-11, gusts up to 14, islands and coasts up to 18 m/s.
The air temperature is 13-17 degrees.
There will be intermittent cloudy weather during the day.
In many places it rains in the yard, in some places thunderstorms are possible.
Blowing southwest winds 6-12, gusts up to 15, islands and coasts up to 20 m/s.
The air temperature is 18-21 degrees.
Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked military convoys in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, according to officials.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in an incident in the city's Qarabaghi district.
The bombing is the latest in an act of violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque attack in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said Thursday night's explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with a "man-worn self-made explosive device."
According to the statement, all of the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airfield.
Correspondents say the growing power of the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS), is a serious source of concern for NATO's forces in Bagram, Qarabgh.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul, mainly in the Shiite district.
The Taliban say they were behind the attack.
On May 31, a major bomb attack killed more than 150 people in downtown — the most deadly military offensive in the country since U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
This violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while United States President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of U.S. troops helping the country's military and police.
Correspondents say the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA annulled the decision to postpone the smog regulation following lawsuits
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed a decision to delay the introduction of an Obama-era ordinance obliging states to limit smog-causing exhaust emissions one day after 15 states sued the agency for its move.
The EPA announced the decision to resume "2015 ozone determination operations" late Wednesday, saying it demonstrates the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe we need to engage in dialogue with our state partners and listen to them," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to postpone ozone concentrations that measure smog pollution in different parts of the country to determine where levels should be reduced by one year to October 2018 to meet the stricter air quality standards.
The 15 primarily Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit Tuesday, saying the decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has been trying to pull back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama. Trump says it's part of a broader plan to boost economic growth.
But those efforts have sparked backlash among Democrats and conservation groups who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA's website states that inhaling ozone-containing air "can reduce lung performance and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases," such as asthma.
German pigs may have a feast.
Germany's pigs and cattle could have a feast as heavy rains threaten the yields of the European Union's second-largest wheat producer, Bloomberg writes.
This year, it may be the case that weeks of rainfall before harvest could mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry is only suitable for feeding animals.
"The quality of wheat is far worse than last year and worse than it was in 2015," said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat could go to animal feed, double compared to normal, Agravis predicted.
German farmers, like their European counterparts, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
At first, the winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which in June was replaced by a heat wave.
In July, Germany was hit by rainfall, which has continued in August.
The eyes of many are turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only five percent of the wheat has been harvested.
Most of the area hasn't even started harvesting yet, said Ceravis, a local harvester.
"It's going to be some pretty difficult days," said Frank Deckert of Rendsburg, a senior trader at Cerasis.
Harmony in everything, i.e. the cunning kinks of Finnish décor
Beautiful nature plays a role in the interiors of the fair houses, because through the large windows the magnificent views of the shores of Saimaa reach many (living) rooms.
Every step of the way, our northern neighbours' quest to create both crisp and perfect (energy-efficient) homes stands out.
The Finns' ability to use wood as a building and finishing material, in the manufacture of furniture and ornamental items, deserves admiration, as well as adherence.
Exhilarating techniques and smart solutions can be found in exhibition houses by both the builder and the (home) designer.
It is evident there that the shades of black, white and grey, if complemented by wood tones and houseplants, can be very moody.
Good ideas can be picked up for another week, as the fair lasts until August 13.
Accessories and herb pots hint that cooking in this kitchen is frequent.
On the night before today, the line was drawn for this year's Weekend Festival Baltic, and Martin Garrix did his best on the main stage to be remembered as the last performer.
The crowd was truly in a turnaround during Garrix's performance — singing, humming, dancing self-deprecatingly.
When Garrix finished, a common mass was scattered from Pärnu Beach to the city.
We bring you a gallery with all the pictures that our photographer captured during the three days of the Weekend.
Surely you are also on some of them, look yourself up!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are expected to be on a collision course to face off in the most engaging boxing match of the near future in the up to 66.7kg weight category, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at the ESPN office in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council light heavyweight champion, walked to the other end of the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's featherweight champion.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over former four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are in the top five of the weight rankings.
Garcia reached out to her right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you success."
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the pair posed for the photos, Lomachenko's manager Egis Karmas noted that a possible confrontation between the fighters would be "the perfect measure."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up [to 63.5kg] for the Broner, but I'm not that big.
I am small at 63.5 kg.
I want to move down to lightweight.
And he has to move up to lightweight [61.2kg] and then we can fight.
Fans have wanted it.
So let's offer them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be paid to watch it. It's part of his strategy to let Lomachenko make his debut in the 61.2kg class later this year to make a possible encounter with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) by next summer, who also has an interest in fighting the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their lightweight title round at the Forum on September 23.
"There could be a fee to watch this fight because the fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said, later saying he was open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We're key players.
No other name can attract so much attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko a "mighty fighter" and could go watch his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in praising Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted that knockout".
According to Garcia, the goal was to show punching strength and then boxing.
Both confirmed that they could feel the tension growing for the affluence between them.
"It's a fight that's waiting to be realized.
No other confrontation generates so much attention and buzz.
I'm more than willing to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
It's going to be a good fight."
From which corners of the world are people moving to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PBGB) extended and issued a record number of more than 13,000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia for work, study or family.
If, for example, last year it was decided to issue a temporary residence permit to 6702 foreigners, then in Tunamullu the figure was 4928.
The authorities cannot say how many immigrants will end up staying in Estonia permanently, but such an analysis is being prepared by the Ministry of the Interior.
While ten years ago nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia every year, in recent years this number is starting to come close to 2000.
The number of applicants for a residence permit increased exponentially during the crisis in Ukraine - in 2014, 1087 people received temporary residence permits, compared to 675 a year earlier.
According to Statistics Estonia, the number of Ukrainian citizens is growing the most in Estonia – 850 more Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia last year than left.
"The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia, and due to the difficult conditions in the country, it is natural that work and study opportunities are sought in a country where the community and, for many, the family are already ahead," said Kristin Rammus, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of the Interior.
Last year and tunamullu, the number of Ukrainians who had obtained temporary residence permits was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although in ten years the largest number of temporary residence permits have been issued to the latter.
If Ukrainians come here predominantly for work, then Russian citizens because of family migration.
"Given the historical Russian community here, they are also more likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, a migration researcher at the Estonian Academy of Security Sciences.
"If you look at where Russian citizens who have obtained an Estonian residence permit have moved, then after Harju County there is Ida-Viru County," he added, pointing out that about 40 per cent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens received temporary residence permits, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to extend their residence permit decreased.
"The leap is due to the fact that instead of renewing the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for in order to permanently settle in Estonia," explained Rammus, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior, according to whom the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained rather stable for many years.
Foreigners who have lived here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia from the previous year.
It aims to encourage people who have adapted to stay here.
However, a long-term resident's residence permit requires, for example, five years.
The renewal of the old residence permit has probably also decreased because of the new residence permit.
For example, last year such a residence permit was granted to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
Now Ukrainians can change jobs, and the Estonian state is no longer figuring out whether the salary criterion has been met.
This residence permit became popular with grey passport holders (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36) last year.
A total of 1968 people received residence permits for settling in Estonia, including, for example, 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years, surprisingly, Nigeria has become a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
While three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, last year 200 were issued to Nigerians.
People from Nigeria come to study at universities here.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular with Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen largely due to study migration.
In the case of them, too, there is a rule that where there is a community in advance, it is easier for others to come to it," Rammus added.
In ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia from, for example, North Korea, the same number from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If about 6000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit a year, that is about 0.46% of the total population.
Even if you count the citizens of the European Union, migration remains at about a percent", maasing commented that in fact the figures are small.
According to Statistics Estonia, a total of 14,822 people migrated to Estonia last year, compared to 13,792 people from here.
That is, immigration exceeded emigration for the second year.
Most of the movers and movers are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among those leaving.
As a result, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was negative last year with 2000 people.
Estonians primarily migrate between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's princess fashion captivates with satchels, embroidery and tulle
However, the bottomless box of ideas has history for Maria Tammeoru - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream for hours somewhere in a museum and admire old-fashioned sleeves and collars.
When you do something with passion, you research and learn more about it every day.
It's the joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may seem lifelike to some, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide for yourself how much shine there is in your life!
I have a girlfriend who has a whole sauna full of haute couture dresses I've created.
Because it's not her fault that she doesn't live in Hollywood and doesn't go on the red carpet every day, she wants to wear those most beautiful dresses too, and she does!
You can make your own life special!
The fashion designer does not recognize the gap between bright events and gray everyday life.
It was this line of reasoning that set in motion the plan to bring high fashion in Estonia to the countryside, between forests and fields, to people whom fashion often does not reach.
The Mammu collection was presented, for example, in Võru, Jõhvi and pärnu fashion alley, where a royal defile with 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, people often take a pose, nod with dignity, but elsewhere there are more emotions - shouting bravo, standing up, wanting to thank you by the hand.
A lot of the audience came to see you, but now they're fans of Mammu Couture.
If you exceed people's expectations, they will be impressed!
And I love the feeling that I'm kind of on a summer tour with my fashion creations.
In Pärnu, we had a 50-meter-long red carpet, a whole street full of beautiful dresses, it seemed that they would not come to an end!
Maria also does not admit to the fashion practice that the creation must be presented by a supermodel supermodel, she is happy to bring ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my own customers to the stage - they have always come with pleasure.
After all, it's such a fun experience, you can shine on stage in a gorgeous dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my show myself, I'm always behind the scenes to give things a final touch as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerve wouldn't allow me to calmly watch from the hall.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who wants not only to play a representative role, but to be in everything by the hand.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio, I carry out most of the collection myself.
I love the whole process where you play with the details, you discover.
I am never far from my creation, and I am not afraid of work.
It's not limited to design, stylistics, logistics, organization, organization - everything has to fit into the day of one temperamental woman.
These hours of work are still huge for fanatics.
I can't say when my workday will end, for me it's just a day full of joy!
I am still very lucky - it is like an incessant chain of happiness: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful, and even more, in turn, compliments.
It has been said many times that there is magic in my dresses - they make me feel like a princess.
The opulent tulle lines that made Maria's talent famous overnight have remained Mammu Couture's signature to this day.
Martin Müürsepp of the U18 boys: the weapon of the Estonian subgroup tournament was now turned against us
It's a pity, the fairy tale came to an end.
The first thing that caught my eye was that we couldn't get our table.
And when there's such a big gap in the table, there's nothing to be done," commented Martin Müürsepp, assistant coach of BC Kalev/Cramo, about the 61:75 loss of the Estonian U18 basketball boys to Great Britain.
Opponents took 28 balls from the offensive board and got so many more attacks because of it.
We were also not ready for their aggressive defense or attack, it struck .
Many attacks by the English ended in three to five seconds, we could not build up the defense.
Defensively, however, they could hold hands everywhere, we couldn't combine.
It kicked the team off its feet.
The opponents' homework was better done.
According to Mason, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to nip the opponents' momentum in the bud.
In the last quarter - we had zero errors, but the opponents already got several quick baskets.
The athleticism and tightness that was our weapon in the subgroup tournament now turned everything against us.
Today we had no strength against their aggressiveness.
Mason was satisfied with his ward in Kalev, Matthias Tassi.
In the tournament in general, good words can be said about the whole team, to this day there was a unified punching fist.
It is a pity that such an aggressive opponent has already been met before.
The cup has been confident all along and still played his field today, but he seemed to be tired - he's been carrying a pretty big load.
But he made some pretty nice moves that I've seen in training before," the instructor added.
Terrible numbers: The girls' basketball team scored less than 10 points in three quarters of the EM tournament...
In the U18 age group, it is not only the young men's EMI B-division basketball tournament in Tallinn, the girls started the day before yesterday in Dublin.
And Estonia's game with Poland unfortunately tended to the realm of anti-records.
Estonia lost 25:65, but it was still 9:49 after the third quarter, meaning it wasn't until the last ten minutes that opponents took their foot off the gas pedal and that period was drawn at 16:16.
In both the first and second quarters, Estonia scored 4, in the third 1 point...
In doing so, the Forwards hit two of the first four throws in two minutes at the start, but then 25 of the game, then one triple in and then another 21 throws...
Perhaps in almost half an hour, one of the 47 throws was hit.
In addition, 2 points came from four free throws.
There were a reasonable number of ball losses during that time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland had a throwing percentage of 33 percent and Estonia 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, with portugal's 83:56 superiority to be acknowledged on the opening day.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to replenish supplies
Today, NATO's 1st Permanent Mine Countermeasures Group arrived in Tallinn for the weekend for a scheduled port visit to replenish the ship's supplies and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships make preparations for returning to sea, while giving the crew members the opportunity to rest for a couple of days.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to conduct a series of exercises and be prepared for future operations to search for historical explosive devices.
"The participation of Estonians in a NATO unit and the co-operative training they carry out in local waters are a good illustration of our integration with allied forces," said Captain Major Arto Reinmaa, commander of the operations and planning department in his capacity as naval fleet commander.
Since 29 June, NATO's 1st Permanent Mine Countermeasures Group will be led by Latvian Marine Lieutenant Gvido Laudups, who took over the duties of group commander from an Estonian naval officer, Lieutenant Johan-Elias Seljamaa, at a ceremony in Riga.
The Latvian Navy's support ship LVNS Virsaitis, on which the group's command staff also operates, has been designated as the flagship of the group.
This semester, the international unit also includes the Estonian Navy's minehunter Sakala.
As one of four groups of ships under the command of NATO Naval Command, NATO's 1st Permanent Mine Countermeasures Group is a readiness unit among the first rapid responders that the Alliance can deploy to various parts of the world within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of Pirita Monastery will once again become the place where the Birgitta Festival, founded 13 years ago by maestro Eri Klas, will be held.
According to Risto Joost (36), artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonic, this year's Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: The audience will receive "Traviata" and "Tosca", classics from the opera world, ballet productions from the enchanting "Bolero" to the hilarious "Karlsson", and there is also no shortage of self-production, which this time is a production of Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorio "Seasons" by the same international creative team who, in 2015, brought Haydn's second masterpiece "Creation" to the stage in Pirita.
The Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatrical productions.
It is larger than any musical theater in its usual form.
It's a festival whose enchantment takes over and never quite lets go again.
For the experience that the listener receives in this sublime and mysterious environment makes human souls ring and touches human perceptions in ways that cannot be described.
Risto, you are the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't maestro Eri Klas' shoes look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it has been very helpful.
He guided me throughout my student career and also supported me early in my conducting career.
Perhaps it is because of this that it will be easier for me to continue his work.
Eri Klas has injected so much kindness into the Birgitta Festival team, and of course all this is transferred to me as well.
It was great to join a team that knows exactly how things are going.
It was the big heart of Eri Klas that gave me the strength to make progress with the Birgitta Festival at the Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am now, and I can do it!
What could excite the audience at this year's festival that you offer in particular?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, surprisingly, the first ballet written for the narration of Astrid Lindgren will be presented.
That's what "Karlsson flies" for.
And one curious nuance about this is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed a desire to write this work.
Apparently, he has the character of Karlsson, who has lived in the soul since childhood.
Risto, how do you handle all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner for sure.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I'm fortunate to have a pile of it.
And I've noticed that my personal emotions don't depend so much on other people as on myself as on myself, i.e. how I respond to each new day.
And such conscious tone-keeping, keeping positivity, and actually smiling at myself in the mirror in the mornings greatly increased my happiness percentage.
Especially now this week, when there are the most important rehearsals, I have been especially keen to practice it and it works.
Smiling to yourself activates the brain and raises the tone.
It's not just a catchphrase.
I don't think people know much about their bodies yet, what the universe offers them, but everyone is slowly discovering it.
Right away, the important moment is just around the corner.
Do you also have some kind of ritual before you step on the conductor's remote?
It is still, clothes need to be replaced with more comfortable ones.
It's that little moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I don't have the opportunity to rest or take a small nap before a big performance.
In fact, I even like to actively interact with people, even before stepping on the conductor's remote.
But come all to the Birgitta Festival, here is something to discover even for a not very great friend of opera and ballet!
Watch a spirited video with Risto Joost!
New results of age assessment tests for Swedish asylum seekers published
In Sweden, asylum seekers underwent a test to assess their age with a novel approach to medicine. The latest results of the test show that more than 80 percent of those tested were rated older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
The tests were created to more accurately assess age during the application for asylum after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of a number of allegedly underage refugees.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases for testing, and the Institute of Forensic Medicine has issued a total of 2481 test results between mid-March 2017 and July 31.
Eighty percent (2002) were rated as 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases, the Institute of Forensic Medicine estimated that the test subject "may be 18 years of age or older."
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the person was "probably younger than 18".
Tests are used only if the age of the person is in question.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent compared to previous months.
"We don't see much difference compared to the stats from previous months, the numbers are pretty consistent," he told The Local newspaper.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were rated as older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The institute issued 581 test results in May and said that in 442 cases, "there are indications that the person being studied is 18 years of age or older."
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of their 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 cases a person had directly claimed that he would be 18 this year.
This medical method of assessing age, during which X-rays are taken of wisdom teeth and MRI of knee joints, after which they are allowed to be analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticized in some circles.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose duties include assessing people's biological maturity to find out if they passed puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I've had reason to think about it, and I don't think the measurement method currently used should be used.
Determining the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, then we shouldn't pretend we can," he told the Metro newspaper.
But Johan Göransson of the Institute of Forensics defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of inaccurately classifying a child as an adult is low.
At about 10%, the risk is highest if the person is just under 18."

20-year-old hammer thrower Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut at the London World Cup, finishing a good 18th with a time of 67.37.
The organ was the youngest female hammer thrower at the World Cup, and the cheerful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and I got a good experience.
On the first attempt (64.80) I immediately did my average result, in the second (62.80) I risked too much, and in the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear," Orel said after the race.
I was looking for my discharge and I am very glad that I found it.
Anna Maria Orel's MMi debut ended in a good 18th place.
The rain did not interfere with Orel, because after all, he trains through the winter at the TUT stadium.
"I'm hardened," he said with a small grin.
London's Olympic Stadium had almost a full house of people, did Orel perceive the people around him or was he able to turn himself off?
I sensed, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says it adds up - that's it!
If you compete on your own, you can experience it.
Organ confirmed that he will be satisfied with his World Cup debut and that he still has many good races ahead of him: "I came here with the 32nd or last result of this season, I finished in 18th place.
This is a very decent result.
I'm 20 years old and MMil - that's the only thing that counts.
I take a good experience with me and some days I want to compete for medals already.
West Virgina governor announces party change
West Virginia's Democrat governor, Jim Justice, announced at a gathering with President Trump Thursday night that he was changing parties.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me," Governor Justice said.
"Today I say to you, having prayed and given plenty of thought... Today I tell you, the West Virginians, that I can no longer help you as a Democratic governor."
Shouts of joy were unleashed as they gathered.
"So I'm going to be a Republican tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time to play another game."
Trump had previously promised a big announcement at a gathering in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the state's only billionaire, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited the coal business from his father.
It is worth approximately $ 1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee (RNC) released an announcement Thursday night that "Governor Justice's party change is another blow to the Democratic Party that would prevent the country from getting better again rather than working toward it."
"With just 15 governorship seats and control over the lowest number of states in history — Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent rejection to a party that is end-to-end leader and unable to find a positive and unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
It's no surprise that where there are a lot of people, there are also a lot of injured.
Urmet, who works in the medical tent at the weekend, told Õhtuleht yesterday that they have had to hand out quite a lot of patches.
Blisters and abrasions are basic, twisting out and slight falls.
Of course, also head, back and leg pains.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with the wrong shoes, and so problems come.
Medics have also had to assist a couple of visitors with major injuries - there have been some panic attacks and also one leg fracture.
We have also done stitching when a person has broken a hand or finger.
We do the smaller stitches here, the bigger ones we send to the hospital.

Coe praised the Russians' honest apology for the doping scandal
Athletics international nose man Sebastian Coe, in his words, praised "Russia's thursday honest apology" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the time to allow the country back into the sport.
Russian athletics frontman Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics that the ban on competition imposed on his country is correct and he has a definite goal in fighting doping.
He apologized to "all the athletics players who have been stripped of their gold and silver medals in competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban on competition imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think today was a very honest response, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian federation itself recognized that they had had quite difficult times and were doing everything possible to restructure the alliance."
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia accepted its own criteria for reinstatement.
"I believe today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the working group's proposal that now is not the right time to withdraw Russia," Coe said.
"We need to do everything we can in the next few months to normalise the situation.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate pure athletes from the corrupted system," he added.
Nineteen Russian track and field athletes who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF will compete as neutral athletes at the World Championships in Athletics, which begin in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF working group, said Monday that Russia does not yet meet several criteria for reinstatement.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council, he told reporters in London that doping controls were still inadequate and that banned coaches were still acting freely.
The electric car revolution is significantly changing the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only will the electric car revolution significantly change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it will also create new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say that in one place they win and in another they lose, smaller mining companies don't help.
Currently, Glencore earns from coal and oil, but in the future in the era of electric cars, the demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminum and nickel will grow.
This year, the governments of the United Kingdom, France and Norway have raised their bets on the proliferation of electric cars, promising to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades.
That's why Volvo has already announced that they plan to abandon the internal combustion engine, and Tesla is launching a cheaper Model 3 electric car.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts that in just two decades, electric cars will be sold more than cars using oil-derived fuels.
"When it comes to some metals, it changes everything," Simona Gambranini, a commodity analyst at Capital Economics, told Bloomberg.
We have already seen a huge impact on such metals as cobalt and lithium, the demand for which has been growing for many years.
Electric cars have about three times as much copper as a regular car, Glencore reported.
Even more copper is needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates that it will increase copper demand by about five percent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore will benefit from the growing electric car trend from rising copper prices and being the world's largest producer of cobalt, Jefferies Group predicted.
According to this brokerage company, the other winners of the triumph of electric cars are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
This year, the London Metal Exchange has seen a 70 per cent rise in cobalt prices.
Last year's price increase was 37 per cent.
Copper has also risen by 14 per cent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's stock rose 20 percent in London, having surpassed rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American in price increases.
On the losing side, there are lead-dealing companies like Recyclex and Campine that will have to adapt to a new era.
The main end use of lead is the batteries that supply current to the starters of gasoline and diesel cars.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless another purpose is found for it that could overcome the drop in demand," said Michael Widmer, chief analysis officer of the metal market at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
In the form of the lead price movement, the effect of the unfolding trend has not yet been noticed.
Lead has risen 17 per cent this year, with it being the best metal in London among the main industrial metals in terms of price increases.
Investors see problems for the metal only in the distant future.
"I'm not sure it's that bad for lead because cheap oil keeps conventional cars competitive," said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager at metal brokerage firm Triland Metals.
When the demand for lead falls, it occurs slowly.
Perhaps this will be the case in about ten years.
In the meantime, tougher exhaust emission standards mean that there will be a growing demand for hybrid cars that rely on advanced lead-based batteries for frequent engine start-ups, according to the International Lead and Zinc Research Organization.
Light metals like aluminum replace steel, as a lighter car can drive further with less electricity.
This explains the additional demand of 1.6 million tonnes of aluminium already from 2013 to 2016.
It accounts for 2.7 percent of the world's total production of aluminum.
That trend is likely to get worse, Widmer said.
Aluminum has risen 13 percent this year as rising demand from automakers has led to a market deficit.
Steelmakers do not sleep.
AK Steel Holding is partnering with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce ultra-light car bodies.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy steel to resist the aluminium.
"High-strength steel should be the answer to this development," said Sylvain Brunet, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.
We are seeing some progress in Europe.
The end of the oil age could also bring suffering to platinum.
Last year, about half of that precious metal was spent on catalysts for diesel cars, metal refiner Johnson Matthey said.
"Many currently high-demand commodities such as oil and platinum may not be in high demand in the future," said Bernard Dahdah, a raw materials analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change over the course of 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe in continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Marc Grynberg, head of Uncore, said more hybrid cars will continue to be sold in 2025 than all-electric cars.
The great hope of platinum manufacturers in a 10-year perspective lies in the hydrogen cell-based cars developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos, which depend on platinum to produce electricity from hydrogen.
However, so far, this technology has not yet justified itself commercially.
"Diesel seems to be a clear loser on the road to electric cars," said Exane BNP of Paribas, Brunet.
German carmakers suffered a major setback in July as a Stuttgart court banned the use of diesel in the hometowns of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football's financial regulations will affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
The rules, which aim to prevent European football clubs from spending rampantly, will not prevent Neymar's world-record transfer from Spanish football club Barcelona to French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body that rules the European game and which has the power to ban teams from participating in a prestigious Champions League tournament, are yet to come from Paris Saint-Germain.
UEFA's financial rules on fair play (FFP) imposed in 2011 mean PSG will have to prove at some point that Neymar's transfer was funded without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar's salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to the French club.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to come up with that kind of money to recruit Neymar and add to their star-studded lineup, given that the team is funded by a family ruled by Qatar's energy offender.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot on recruiting players, but they need to balance that with legal sources of income that allow them to come up with theirs in the football business.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platini after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fall into big debts in search of success are actually engaged in cheating and risk ruin should banks or owners give up support.
Since 2011, the FFP has been focusing on tracking their losses instead of the debts of clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in 2003 at Chelsea — to buy a club with potential and then make big expenditures to improve the team and build a global brand — will be harder to implement.
During the current three-year assessment period of the FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs could incur losses of up to €30 million.
And despite Platini being shamefully ousted from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, remains committed to preventing overspending.
"FFP is certainly not dead, and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," Andrea Traverso, who is the FFP's overseer at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid for Neymar's over-purchase clause as a single full payment, they are able to split that amount into tranches for accounting purposes throughout the life of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so it will be possible to show the transfer fee for the next five years in the amount of 44.4 million euros per year.
On the occasion of the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, received the toughest penalties on their necks.
PSG were fined €60 million ($82 million at the time), which were later reduced to €20 million, and the club was required to limit the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to outsmart regulatory financial institutions by blowing up their income through companies linked to club owners.
The Qatar company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income.
This is what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority PSG grant was bloated.
It has been rumored that some part of Neymar's PSG service could come through payments from Qatar by the 2022 World Cup organizing committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become a World Cup ambassador and argue that UEFA regulators could easily uncover such a maneuver.
The penalties previously handed down to PSG mean UEFA will be even more vigilant regarding any attempt to ignore the rules.
People familiar with the situation said Thursday that UEFA has not discussed Neymar's transfer with PSG in advance.
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that their anonymity be guaranteed as they are not allowed to discuss PSG's situation.
The most recent reports show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in the 2015-2016 season with a turnover of approximately 542,4 million euros.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG are hoping that Neymar's arrival will have a positive impact on sponsorship deals, merchandising and shirt sales.
The club expects at least a 30 per cent increase in turnover due to the signing of the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, tried to block Neymar's transfer by claiming PSG were violating FFP with it.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the country," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, suggesting that PSG are primarily owned by Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports magnate, shares La Liga's stance that the state is funding the club.
"It's a consequence of property rights and it has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.
"If the club is owned by the state, anything is possible.
It's very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play because the state may have other ways or other interests to have such a great player represent the country."

50 years ago today: a hurricane-sized storm in Estonia that tore roofs and windows from houses.
The hurricane called the storm of the century, which raged on 6 and 7 August, caused major damage primarily to Lääne County, Harju County and Rapla County.
In northwestern Estonia, the wind speed during these days was more than 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one curved tree in the garden to another and tried with his hands to support them.
Everything was dark and rattled, like the end of the world.
Roofs were already flying from the houses in Taama, recalled Linda Kurova of Haapsalu, an old lady, in an interview with Eesti Loodus magazine in 2002.
Linda's husband saw the garden she planted collapse.
But what do you still support the trees with your hands, where can you withstand such a storm?
The sea came under the window, water splashed in from the windows," said Mrs. Linda, who lived on Kalda Street in Haapsalu at the time.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway station's apron had flown 20-30 meters away, Linda, like most of the Haapsaluans, could not be seen until the next morning.
According to locals, the trees behind Paralepa were on the ground, some completely lying down, some in half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm went through the beautiful old trees with a rattle and a crackle like a war.
Lääne-Viru County was not particularly badly affected by the August 1967 storm compared to Western Estonia, but the damage was also large there, virumaa Teataja wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padise Park were swept from the ground, but our parks in kandi were also badly damaged.
In Tallinn, wind speeds of up to 35 meters per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour, were measured.
On the evening of August 6th in Merivälja, Tallinn, a tiny plikatirts had shouted: "Mom, mom!
The chickens are in the air and can't get down anymore!", wrote Virumaa Teataja.
The building of Põlli Manor in Viljandi County was destroyed during the storm to such an extent that it was decided to demolish it later.
The structures of the Türi ski jumping hill, which were later no longer restored, did not withstand the August storm.
The Red Star newspaper wrote on August 12, 1967, that the harvesting of cities and settlements from fallen trees and their branches was progressing slowly, and residents could get involved in the cleanup.
Grain fields were also badly damaged in the storm, and the newspaper reported that "party organizations must be inspirations and guides in both clean-up and grain harvesting."
Hurricanes can be talked about when the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record for gusting winds in Estonia persists from 2 November 1969, when a wind speed of 48 m/s was measured in Ruhnu.
On Vaindloo Island, the measuring instrument broke, so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret of clean bathing areas: night cleaning and poor beach weather
Colder summer weather also means less cleaning effort in Tallinn's bathing areas.
"When it's without, people are on the beach, and if it's not, there aren't people," says the beach cleaner.
Seagulls are screaming at Stroomi beach in North Tallinn.
For them, melodic competition is provided by a tractor bouncing at low revs, plowing down stripes on the plaza.
In fact, the latter sifts through the sand from a depth of seven centimeters, picking out marine debris and debris left behind by people: bottle caps, cigarette butts and more.
People still come to the beach, regardless of whether the water is warm or not.
If the weather is nice, then people are on the beach, and if there are not, there are no people," says Aleksandr Usov, head of beach cleaning at Haabersti Haldus, a private limited company.
It's 6:30 a.m. and there's a bitter cleanup going on on the beach, because at eight o'clock the place has to be okay for people.
Usov is on the work post already from four o'clock.
In addition to Stroomi, he also keeps an eye on Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe and Paljasaare Pikakari beaches.
Garbage volumes have decreased.
Years ago, there was a lot more of it.
People can now already appreciate what is being done for them," says Usov, who has been cleaning up the beaches for 15 years.
It used to be that when something new was put up, it was already broken the next day.
Now what is on the beach is already being kept.
Clean beach price
One of the biggest jobs on Estonian beaches is cleaning up marine litter washed ashore.
For example, on Pirita beach, 400,000 tons of it has to be transported during the beach season.
"It's an incredible amount," Usov notes.
The second major category is household waste, that is, everything that people leave behind.
On the one and a half kilometer strip of Stroomi beach there are eight large garbage containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
That's how much garbage is generated.
However, colder summer weather has meant that garbage is one fifth less than it would otherwise be.
The third species is formed by abandoned things.
Most often these are children's shoes.
As a prey this time, Usov has shoveled a dozen model cars out of the sand.
They are left waiting for the owners on the wooden road leading to the beach.
"Usually more of them come out, but that's a normal catch". Usov already knows that soon he will find them again inside the sand.
Children come to the beach and take the toys to drown them in the sand again.
Garbage is scattered
Erika Scholler, a representative of haabersti administrative services, admits that the tractor's screening work is disturbing locals.
The noise, which lasts from night hours to early in the morning, interferes with the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
However, during the day this work is impossible.
In one month you need to sift through the beach twice.
"If we don't, the district will fine us," Scholler notes.
However, the goal, like Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu, is to get Stroomi beach under the international blue flag quality label.
"Compared to Europe, Estonia has a lot more work to do to ensure that the beaches are maintained," says Scholler.
We have more plows and rocks and harder to sift sand.
However, there is less litter on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
Upon hearing that there is talk of garbage on the beach, Martin, who lives near Stroomi Beach, unforcedly enters a conversation between a journalist and cleaning staff, highlighting the current bottlenecks on the beach.
In the mornings there is an obscene picture everywhere.
The problem is with the birds and bottle pickers who have pulled the garbage bags upside down," martin reports.
While it's hard to assume that people will be able to change their current behaviour, Martin hopes the city government will do something about trash cans and put covers on them, for example, to at least prevent the birds from exploring there.
Overall, however, Martin is pleased with the development of Stroomi Beach.
It can be seen that the city takes care of this.
With children's squares, illuminated and freshly paved roads, it has become more pleasant.
It used to be the case that roller skates could only be driven on one road," Martin notes.
Treasure Hunter's Finds in Stroomi: coins, coins only
The morning tide has been taken advantage of by 40-year-old Dimitri, who, as a treasure hunter, combs the beachfront with a metal detector.
He does not believe that he will find anything precious today or in the future.
The sea gods are not generous enough for this.
"I have been dealing with it for a year and have not found anything valuable so far", reports Dmitry.
As a hobby treasure hunter, Dmitry's treasure bag contains some euro coins, bottle caps, and also dangerous nails that later throw in the trash.
Usually there are still coins.
"Gold, rings and the like don't usually exist," the treasure hunter states.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at their previous levels as powerless economic growth and a easing in inflation have softened speculation about the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish as households' stabbing incomes have put interest rates on hold.
Policymakers in the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to keep the 6-2 rates at 0.25%, and fewer members are calling for an increase this month as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and 2018 to 1.6%, and warned that pressure on household incomes would remain as inflation continues to rise to close to 3% in the fall.
At the same time, the bank also signalled that an increase in rates over the next few years will be necessary to contain Brexit-induced inflation and that financial markets may need to raise borrowing costs above expectations.
Members also voted to partially withdraw the mammoth package that boosts the economy launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
The bank will end a fixed-term funding scheme in February that provides cheap financing to banks, although it said a £15bn bid of £115 billion is now expected under the scheme.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the bank says: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain powerless for the foreseeable future, as the difficult situation of real household incomes continues to have an impact on consumption."
On rates, it was reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" is necessary to mitigate inflation, and to a "somewhat larger" extent than expected in the markets.
The exchange is currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and a second rise in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any jumps are stepped and limited.
The bank's reduced growth forecasts for this year and next are comparable to those for May of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast for 1.8 percent growth in 2018 remained.
After this news, the rate of the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to USD 1.31 and 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make the changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures that have dampened growing hopes of rising GDP rising from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
The bank says growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up some momentum at the end of the year.
The bank's latest inflation report gave households suffering from rising inflation and wretched wage increases little reason to rejoice, saying the situation would get a little worse before it improved.
It was added that monetary policy could not prevent a blow to incomes in the next few years, but wages are expected to recover significantly towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Because of the weak pound, the economy is also stimulated by the growing demand for British produce, which partly compensates consumers for lower costs.
The decision comes a year after the rates were moved to 0.25% last August after a shocking EU referendum that caused the pound to suddenly weaken.
The bank estimates it will likely take four years to breathe full life into prices and the economy.
Before the bank's last decision, there was a growing demand for rate increases, as inflation had increased pressure on distressed households; In July, three policymakers called for the rate to be raised to 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was as expected and will see a resurgence in the coming months.
The bank said the excess growth compared to the 2 percent target was due entirely to a weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Head of Mortgage Brokers at Coreco, said: "Given the recent decline in exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is becoming more and more competitive again, as lenders crave work and hope to end the year in a positive way.
The exchange seems particularly favorable to those whose current transactions are nearing completion, as refinancing, often at no service fee and at low rates, has become increasingly popular."
The NHS is about to prescribe a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients have access to "transformative" HIV preventative care since September after a battle in the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England reported that national health will now make pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) available to an estimated 10,000 people during the initial three-year clinical trial — a pill administered before intercourse that has shown a roughly 86% reduction in the risk of infection in high-risk people.
The NHS agreed to fund the clinical trial after the Court of Appeals upheld last year's Supreme Court ruling that the NHS was able to pay for PrEP, despite the agency's own claims that the drug should be funded by local authorities instead.
NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens hailed the move, unveiled on Thursday, as a "new large-scale intervention", while the National Aids Foundation (NAT) described it as a "pivotal moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start registering people. More clinics will be added in October before the programme is rolled out everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medications taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of contracting HIV.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there are a sufficient amount of certain medications in the human body that prevent infection with HIV.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before intercourse.
Eligible candidates for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and people whose partners are infected with HIV and do not receive treatment.
Clinics identify eligible people who are willing to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people, and those whose partner with HIV is not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a GP there can also register their wish to participate at a local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to get the medicines in place this week after an international procurement process.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the true potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who the drug is for and how it is consumed and applied in the big picture.
Stevens said: "This new large-scale intervention should complement and amplify the large-scale and increasingly successful fight against HIV transmission.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of fighting one of humanity's greatest health problems."
Deborah Gold, NAT's chief executive officer, said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted at those who need it and belong to a risk group, offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at high HIV risk in England will have access to a powerful new tool through this NHS-funded clinical trial that is individually manageable and not dependent on negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "The priority now is to ensure that the clinical trial is quickly launched across the country and that not a single person at risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial drug has been procured, we are on our way to protecting the more than 10,000 people at risk of contracting HIV.
Sharon Hodgson, shadow minister for public health, said: "The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and well overdue after months of delays and dragging government legs.
Evidence shows how much change this drug can bring to HIV prevention and ending the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial brings us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial is rolled out across the country as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and bring us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
The price of electricity rose by 12% in Estonia, while in Latvia and Lithuania it fell.
In July, the difference in the exchange price of electricity the following day between the price areas of Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to 1.94 euros, compared to 7.71 euros in June this year, Elering said.
The main reason for the difference in price is the failure of the Lithuanian-Swedish connection.
In Estonia, the average exchange price of electricity last month was EUR 34.33 per megawatt-hour, and the price increased by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to EUR 36.27 per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34.17 and the system price of the Nord Pool power exchange was EUR 26.37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices rose by 12 and seven percent, respectively.
Electricity moved between Estonia and Finland in 75 per cent of the hours of the previous month towards Estonia and 16 per cent of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
For the remaining nine percent of the hours between the two countries, there were no next-day transactions.
Electricity moved between Estonia and Latvia 99 per cent of the time from Estonia to Latvia, and 73 per cent of the hours used the entire transmission capacity.
According to the transactions made on the Nasdaq OMX market on the last trading day of July, the exchange price of electricity may be approximately 34 euros per megawatt-hour in August and 37 euros per megawatt-hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide, which affects the price of electricity production, rose last month, and transactions took place at a price of 5.04-5.47 euros per ton.
Living a high life - a half-story and clever design tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate property innovator, swapped her big Knightsbridge home for an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It's on the ground floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and resold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with my former partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface," Joanne said.
"I was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I offered.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day."
Since the first visit, this 93-square-meter apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
At first it was an apartment with one bedroom and an intricate layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom. Joanne wanted to add storage space and a half-floor to take advantage of the high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
Those were my demands," he said.
He hired Erfan Azad from Duck & Shed, an architecture and design studio in Notting Hill, to take advantage of the 3.8m high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling wasn't high enough to add two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a half-floor where you could stand upright.
Erfan had to approach the matter creatively.
"The metal structure is quite complex," he explains.
"We had to rearrange the rooms so that they were on top of each other without having to bend over.
It wasn't just about building the platform, we were using a steel structure to make sure the height of both the upper and lower spaces was correct."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two full-height rooms on top of each other in the room, with plenty of dramatic elements.
From the half-floor there is a view of the glamorous living space below from an old-fashioned Retrouvius window with copper light.
Golden furniture with a mirrored surface, silver details and a retro vibe of Serge Mouille's luminaire emphasize the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, spaciousness and brightness.
Mirrors are attached to both ends of the short hallway to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the back wall with a mirror gives the impression of a window opening into another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet provides storage space for all Joanne cutlery and glassware.
The charm of the living room is added by the possibility of closing the kitchen part when not in use, creating an image of a more glamorous room.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, what is unique about this kitchen is the fact that it is a garage-type retractable door.
"It took a little bit of design trouble," Erfan explains of the steel reinforcement veneered MDF door.
"It has a counterweight, which is why it glides very easily when pushed up."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra square meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"After all, floor space is what you sell — or what gives value to real estate," Erfan says.
"A realtor walks into a room in an outdated form and makes calculations based on the area of the floor."
Here they have managed to increase the floor area, while using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"The materials are the ones you touch that help create an emotional connection with the home," Erfan says.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical cable in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make the heart's tongues ring."
This indicates that a good design and an increased area will help to make a fairly ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they may even make you want not to leave, as happened with Joanne.
The protagonist, Dane Jensen, is a bounty hunter in a Chicago skyscraper who competes with a colleague for a promotion.
What counts is nothing more than the amount of money earned, next to which any ethics is forgotten.
A man sees his wife and three children only early in the morning and late at night.
In the first half of the film, I catch myself thinking that this is, after all, the business world version of "House of Cards" — even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's talking tune is similar.
As the film goes on, however, the less frame-like element remains, and the filmmakers' moralizing intent begins to stand out more and more.
A life-changing experience for the protagonist becomes the illness of his son with cancer.
The choice now has to be made between work and family life.
The son, who dreams of the profession of architect, makes his father think about really important things like faith, kindness, love..., on his father's walks to the great buildings of Chicago, not even the disaster of the Twin Towers will remain untouched.
After the third scene, where the son opens his father's eyes, one gets the feeling that the filmmakers have proceeded from the goal of making sure to get the audience to cry, because even the viewer with the most callous heart will not be able to hold back tears when he sees the suffering of a cute boy with cancer.
When the son falls into a coma and his situation seems almost hopeless, the father finally understands the immorality of his work and does a good deed to the old man looking for work.
Now I bet on myself in my mind - if the film has a happy end, then I reward my insight after the film with coffee, but if I'm wrong, then the screenwriter can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there's a suspicion that I'm missing out on coffee — when my husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man rushes down the hallway toward the ward in slow motion.
However, the son has recovered wonderfully, and although his father has just lost his job, this also turns out to be a positive thing, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I can feel good too - I can already predict the end of the American drama pretty well!
To give credit to the truth, the film is well constructed, all the necessary elements for this are present.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good, and the morality is beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I guess this movie brings in well.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
In this case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the White House's new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information reaching President Trump, including news, in the hope that it will keep the boss in flatter water.
Here's an excerpt from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with high-ranking officials on his first day on the job, he highlighted a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to solve by getting bad information into the president's hands.
Kelly told officials that information needs to flow through him, whether on paper or in meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he was given good information."
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have also tried to do so, and they've failed to tame Trump by tracking his media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habits haven't gone away.
"If candidate Trump was upset about the dishonest media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also honestly featured in influential publications," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "six former campaign employees say the key to controlling Trump's Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption also consistently includes praise."
Good.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter usage habits have once been "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something the rest of us don't know that Trump's tweets would have been even more incendiary without these interventions.
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't post.
If his assistants were able to save him from mischief, even a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from consistently generating controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which is made up of competing clicks, people try exclusively to advance their own interests by passing on to Trump material that supports their worldviews, but may not always be credible.
Politico, which covers the entire course of the story, wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to feed the president information of strategically questionable value.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"Current and former Trump subordinates say Trump may be responding to negative press, especially information leaks with damaging effects, explosively, obsessed with identifying their source.
That's what happened in late February, when someone sadly gave the president a printed copy of a GotNews.com article on a website owned by internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson that accused Deputy Chief of Human Resources Katie Walsh of being the White House's "source of a series of information leaks."
It doesn't matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of the mockery, or that he didn't offer any concrete evidence, or that he has also made false accusations in the past and withdrawn them.
Trump read the article and started asking subordinates about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that reince Priebus, the chief of staff at the time, and Rob Porter, head of the White House office, "have been trying to put in place a system to manage and document documents that reach Trump."
How did it work out?
Kelly tries to do exactly the same three months later.
He may turn out to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his aides are still vying for influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians who have come to the capital from abroad are reluctant to obtain permission to perform.
There are many foreigners in the center of Tallinn who play music.
Those with whom Õhtuleht spoke admitted that they play in the Old Town without the permission of the city government.
We were the first to find three street musicians near the Viru gates who had taken the same number of dogs with them.
It was clearly seen that the musicians in dreadlocks and blasted clothes were backpackers who would take one shower.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the company played a song with an amusing rhythm on the accordion, while one man next to her juggled the three-ball and invited passers-by closer.
A third man had sat next to them on one of the backpacks and smoked his own ready-made blob in peace of mind.
Their three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing crowd.
Noemi, who played the accordion, and Bob, who juggled the balls, said they were playing in the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the group's performance was to collect ticket money for a ship sailing to Finland on the evening of the same day.
When asked if they asked the city for permission to play in the Old Town, Noemi and Bob shook their heads.
First, we didn't know.
Secondly, we never stay in one city for more than a day or two, and most of the time permits are given for a month or something like that.
There's no point in paying for it," Bob explained.
When we got to the Viru gates again about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were with the musicians and were driving them away.
The group moved with backpacks and dogs to the viru keskus junction to try their luck.
Three Polish young men also performed on Viru Street, one of whom played the violin, the other the clarinet, and the third had even carried an electronic piano.
"We're here to entertain people, to spread music and joy, and to make money for fuel and living," explained the trio's pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivosh, they are aware that to perform, you must have permission from the city government.
"Of course we don't have it," he said jokingly.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, then there will be no problem.
Of course, if the police come, we'll go elsewhere, but we'll have to try," he added.
Eesti Pank bought 149 million euros worth of bonds in July as part of the public sector asset purchase programme of the central banks of the euro area, and the central bank's bond portfolio increased to a total of 4.36 billion euros.
The central bank does not publish more detailed information about purchases.
Governor of Eesti Pank Hardo Hansson has previously explained, in response to an interpellation by members of the Riigikogu, that the asset purchase programme of the central banks of the Eurosystem includes three different purchase programmes: covered bonds for the financial sector, asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys up bonds on the market to encourage investors who have sold them to invest their money elsewhere.
The effect of purchases is to reduce the return on lower-risk assets, which incentivises investors to take greater risks.
As a rule, under the public sector bond purchase programme, each central bank buys government bonds of its own country, while other countries' bonds are not purchased.
As the Estonian state has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank makes so-called replacement purchases within the limits of the volume allocated to them.
Buy-ins are also made by central banks in countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the PSAP is limited.
According to Hansson, Eesti Pank generally buys bonds of European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank has been buying bonds under the asset purchase programme since March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering's bonds were also acquired, but Eesti Pank will no longer buy Elering's bonds from June 2016.
As of June, both Elering's and Eesti Energia's central banks will be purchased by the Central Bank of Finland on behalf of the central banks of the euro area.
Travelers ignore the ditch and return to the "millionaire district"
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners have found themselves once again in a fierce confrontation with determined travelers who have ignored a ditch dug by the council to win back a field away from their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans in the field near Solihull Street, christened the wealthy "millionaire district."
They have returned with an army of horses, children and trucks after they were kicked out of there only in May, without being distracted by a ditch dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a weak spot in the guardrail, squeezing their vehicles through an unobstructed part that had been left as a footpath.
Furious residents have cursed solihull council, saying the council is "useless in dealing with the problem".
One anonymous resident said: "They moved there Monday night after they were ousted from Bentley Heath, where they stoned passers-by.
The council must be shamed to take action because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were driven away, and now they are back again.
There were more of them last night, probably more today."
He added: "Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by procuring long barriers to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy that I have to continue paying the council tax if the council can't even stop such a thing."
One local resident, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: "It's ridiculous. We have only just seen the last of these travelers leave, and a new offensive is already taking place.
This time the number has increased and even a horse has been seen ruminating in the grassland."
A solihull councillor said: "We are aware that there is an unacceptable campground on land near Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihull police. We will take the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
It is very helpful in gathering evidence if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This will help to create a picture of the situation for the court as we present the case to them."
The weekend festival will be visited by the Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, among others, who is glad that real top names in the world have been brought to Estonia.
When asked why the Weekend festival is so important for Estonians, Saar replies that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the festival's three days of talk to the fullest.
However, he admits that real players in their field have arrived in Pärnu.
"Looking at the level of artists that have been able to be brought to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre are being brought home - this does not happen often in our country," says the Minister of Culture.
But which of the artists performing at the festival speak to Saar the most?
I consider myself a relatively old man, and for old people like me, surely one of the most experienced artists is Armin van Buuren, who performed last night.
According to his record spin, all of us have twisted our feet at some point," he says.
However, he still brings out several names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian players: starting with NOËP, you can read a whole series of them.
In reality, this concentration of well-known names is very high," he says.

Audi upgrades up to 850,000 diesel vehicles amid criticism from automakers
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer a software upgrade to more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to the BMW chairman, the company believes "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", citing European cities, including BMW's hometown of Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it will upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel engine emissions.
No company described these actions as a recall.
European car manufacturers have been eagerly promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, nitric oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment installed for automotive companies to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles will increase, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German automakers are under close scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of pampering powerful automakers and ignoring signs of a problem.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which silenced the use of so-called fraudulent devices, which allowed the exhaust emission readings to be adjusted to comply with the regulations while the car was tested, but withdrew under normal driving conditions.
Several volkswagen drivers have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics division of Audi's engine development division was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could go on trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn into a criminal investigation into a Volkswagen in Germany when authorities accused Audit of installing a system to circumvent Europe's emissions requirements, thereby expanding an investigation previously focused on the United States.
Audi's involvement in the investigation could be a major blow to Volkswagen as the luxury car maker generates a disproportionately high share of Volkswagen's profits.
European Union flags are purchased for 20,000 euros for Estonian schools.
The Ministry of Education plans to buy European Union flags for Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the presidency.
In total, 570 educational institutions will receive the European Union flag with dimensions of 105x158 centimeters.
The flags are intended for display indoors, they must be executed in high-quality printing technology indoors also with a tunnel mount, according to the ERR news portal.
The flagpole sign reads: "A gift to Estonian schools to mark the first presidency of the Council of the European Union in Estonia.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is estimated by the Ministry of Education at 20,000 euros, i.e. one flag will cost 35 euros.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat situation in Mexico
Employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to cover the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, sown by organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But today, under the guise of personal tragedy, they have gathered to discuss their own safety.
They are told that it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss which seems safer: either to bring the children with them to the office that was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the head of the room: "enemies", "neutral", "allies".
They ask reporters to provide names in each column there is no need for evidence, impressions and gut feelings are enough.
Drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or cartels, with a whole list of bad guys who make it dangerous to cover the chaos in Mexico.
There is no pause for breath from the violence, and the more bodies pile up across the country, the more of them are made up of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, there have been at least 25 of them since President Enrique Pena Nieto was sworn in in December 2012.
The latest casualties include their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence can be perceived everywhere on the façade of the Riodoce building hangs a large picture of Valdez pointing the middle finger with the inscription "Justice", and two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts depicting his smiling face with glasses or his characteristic Panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate Public Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, only two cases have been brought to justice, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime murders, which amount to thousands, the killers of journalists rarely go to trial.
Riodoce's editorial continues to cover the violence in Sinaloa, even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without murderers' data and justice, a security meeting won't be of much use, according to Ibarra.
"It's very silly to waste your time in this meeting," he says.
"As long as the cause is unknown, you distrust everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the state's capital, on the morning of May 15.
He managed to drive only a few blocks before two men stopped his red Toyota Corolla. He was forced to get out of the car and was shot 12 times. This is presumably because of the name of the newspaper, which translates as "twelfth river".
An armed man drove away in Valdez's car and made an accident with it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left behind by a wife and two adult children.
Rumors are spreading freely in Culiacan.
But on Valdez's subject, there is essentially only silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival cliques struggle to fill a power vacuum.
It doesn't matter that a few people or even several people are shot on the streets of Sinaloa every day, or that the graveyard is teeming with opulently decorated double mausoleums of drug kings larger than the homes of many living.
Let us forget for a moment that peacetime refers to the fact that a seaside state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States is governed by only one cartel.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was thoroughly aware of the dangers of his job, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, co-founder and ceo of Riodoce, feels immense guilt that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes the killing was aided by two mistakes.
The first was the release in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the nose man of the cartel clique, who is competing with Guzman's sons and is at war.
This piece of writing may have angered the sons suspected gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they reached the newsstands.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after a raid on another newspaper editorial covering the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had stayed alive for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would be there forever.
He was working as a veteran reporter for the newspaper Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling $50 shares.
Bojorquez said it was "impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem" in Sinaloa.
Over time, the newspaper gained notoriety with its bold and honest coverage, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish vigorous research without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by the print, from which they could read stories that no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its Latin American coverage.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists (AKK) for his courage to follow Mexico's drug history wherever it leads.
He candidly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said, accepting the AKK Award.
Last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to embrace the task that comes with the profession of journalist the other way is to play the fool.
I don't want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn't talk about what was going on."
The Riodoce collective misses Valdez, a joker who roamed like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared embraces and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office to the El Guayabo bar across the road and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if his love of routine became fatal to him.
His death has also caused them to question themselves how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like to mess around with these women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
"These things weren't allowed to be touched," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is strong self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting your instincts.
If the thing smells suspicious, stay away.
According to Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, the problem is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and that's what happened to Javier".
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero or any other state that is home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce staff got together for security training, suddenly mobile phones were no longer allowed; a few days before that, it was revealed that spyware sold only to governments had been used to track journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two policemen sought relief from the 40-degree heat in the shade of a tree.
The government appointed them to guard the Riodoce office, which is located in a four-story building in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters half-jokingly wondered if these cops were among the 50 percent of police officers who have been branded unreliable by the governor himself.
Several months have passed since reporters have traveled to the mountainous countryside, where control is de facto in the hands of drug gangs.
This week's edition of Riodoce covered three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story of spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor's office, a group of people were kidnapped.
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so care had to be taken when it was time to write what everyone in town knows the restaurant is a favourite place for both drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics for almost the entire last century.
More recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption in lawsuits with widespread coverage.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at the same location, including how the son of Guzman, who bears the nickname El Chapo, escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched for Valdez's column to get information about the kidnapping from the best sources.
"In the past, we would have already known what happened," said the 46-year-old Villarreal, whose kleenuke physique has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been interrupted."
Valdez's office has become a storage room for labels and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and editorial staff have become something they never expected activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of labels and headed to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration over another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burnt body has been found and officials say it belongs to him, based on DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become more vocal and scribble the phrase "SOS press" on sidewalks and buildings as an organized protest.
On that day, President Bojorquez is away in Washington, D.C., trying to garner international support to bring justice to the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's death, while meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked to be diverted away from covering the government's actions, worrying that anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said Mexican journalists were "besieged" by organized crime, complicit state officials, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, "Drug Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but are also being killed at the behest of politicians and security forces who are in a quandary with organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and government officials last year.
"In Mexico, you die because you want to be silenced," Ramirez said.
The murders are obviously bloodthirsty.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found along with a letter believed to have been signed by the Los Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to his battered head.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the El Norte newspaper in chihuahua, a northern border state, after their correspondent Miroslava Breach was killed in March.
Others continue to shoot as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their manager in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez newspaper publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front cover, "What do you want from us?".
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It's a nerve-wracking decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still have to peek through the streets to avoid dangers.
And sometimes they are chased, as presumably happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered along with four women in 2015 in a Mexico apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay still and continue to work have to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that covering the drug business scares her.
"Mexico is on its way to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, when the latest number had already been locked, Riodoce editors were sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office sipping beer when suddenly everyone's phones began to vibrate.
In the beachside resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people had been killed in firefights between rival gangs and security forces, according to confirmed deaths.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by several messages left by cartels found in the area.
From that very edge of the sidewalk, reporters posted the news on the Riodoce website using a mobile phone.
The front cover of the next day needed to be changed.
Sirens huddled along another exchange of fire in the area.
Bojorquez peeked at the police officers on duty to see if they were vigilant.
If they were afraid, at least they didn't show it.
Under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, on which his middle finger can be seen all over Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce edited in his footsteps.
"How could one even think about the closure," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day that Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send him to the streets to report?"
Dinosaur used protective coloring to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, although quite scary.
Scientists have now unveiled the first findings regarding an incredible rhinoceros-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner, which is so well preserved that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to detect that his skin, covered with scales, was reddish-brown in color and his past had been somewhat "complex".
The report, published in the journal Current Biology, described the creature as "the best-preserved armoured dinosaur ever found" and as "one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
As for the fossil, this is a new species of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation struck researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable."
This scale-covered vegetarian is the best-preserved fossil of the type ever found, according to National Geographic magazine.
It was found on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that did not resemble the surrounding stone and decided to take a closer look.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, work was underway to dig the animal out of a 2500-pound (1100-pound) piece of land.
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to be brought to the public.
"If you squint your eyes a little, you can almost believe he's asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is exhibited.
"It goes down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
Studying his skin, the researchers found that this plant-eater, although covered with scales and resembling a walking tank, was likely to be significantly threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
This dinosaur, with its many scales, used red and white protective colours to hide from predators and applied a shading technique called counter-eclipse, which is also used by many animals today.
This, according to experts, allowed the dinosaur to better blend into the surroundings and avoid enemies, since larger dinosaurs probably hunted for him.
This 110 million-year-old creature belonging to the family of nodosaurus first made it to the news in May and is now available for visit at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers have now studied the creature and named it after Mark Mitchell, a laboratory technician at the Borealopelta Markmitchell Museum, who was part of a team that spent more than 7000 hours trying to expose the animal.
Thanks to the astonishingly good preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the scales on the animal's body.
They discovered a counter-eclipse - a method of protection common in the animal kingdom, which means that the upper half of the creature was darker than the lower one.
Although counter-eclipse is common, the findings come as the Borealopelta is much larger than the counter-eclipse animals that live today.
This suggests that the dinosaur was actively hunted enough by other carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution preferred hiding instead of confrontation as a survival tactic.
But most of today's animals that use counter-eclipse — such as deer, zebras, or armadillas — are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that nodosaurus had to truly struggle to survive.
"The vigorous hunt for a huge dinosaur covered with abundant scales shows how dangerous the Cretaceous dinosaur predators may have been," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal to get clues about its life, including the preserved contents of its gut, to figure out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river when he died, thereby reaching the sea with a current, where he sank with his back to the ocean floor.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in South Florida, and rivers and oceans probably extended much further inland than they do now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, while it has also remained three-dimensional, preserving the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the Cretaceous period.
You don't have to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it - it's enough just to squint your eyes and it seems as if he's asleep."
The Cretaceous period was the time when huge carnivorous dinosaurs moving on two legs - theropods - wandered the Earth.
Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a monster 38 feet (11.5 meters) tall and weighing six tons.
Scientists, whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was washed into the sea after its death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was discovered on March 21, 2011, by Shawn Funk while mining at a Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including leather and scales, and is a complete cone up to the hips.
These creatures averaged 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two 20-inch-long squirrels pierced out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this armored-covered plant eater adventured through what is now western Canada until a flooded river washed it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's undersea burial ground helped preserve its scales in exquisite detail.
The petrified remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the rumbling armor plates along the dinosaur skulls are still covered with skin remains.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic magazine, "Such a degree of preservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The remains of petrified skin still cover the proboscis armor plates located on the animal's skull.
The right front leg is lying next to him, and the five toes are extended upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole."
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell received a complete shock.
Just a day after traveling to New York, this St. Louis resident sat on a bed in a rented room via Airbnb, browsing Facebook on his phone.
He came across a post from his former schoolmate.
It read: "Police just killed an 18-year-old youth and he is still lying on the street."
He was confused as to why no one else had posted this information on his feed, which is why he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
The user's posts, @TheePharoah handled, had been repeatedly shared along his timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area broadcast live tweets about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black young man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's insane," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put his phone away, but later in the evening saw tweets again announcing a gathering of people on Canfield Drive.
Photos of police tape and screaming people and a man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept a sign with the inscription "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!" were shared.
He watched a live stream of a policeman standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer, he said, rifled and yelled, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he caught himself thinking, "It's unusual."
"It's not the kind of murder we're used to and what we could call typical."
I felt scared in that moment.
I was angry and crying."
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
Having landed at 11 p.m., he went to pick up his six-year-old daughter with his father and decided that they would drive the two of them to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferelli and Ferguson over the next three years is a central theme in the new documentary "Whose Streets?" ("Whose Streets?"), which premieres in cinemas on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and toughness from the point of view of those who live in this community and who filled the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell and his daughter — who was wearing a floral dress and a crown matching it on her head — drove towards Ferguson, they chatted again about a topic they'd talked about repeatedly earlier this morning — about the experiences and living conditions of black people.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights?" he recalls asking himself.
"We're driving to Ferguson right now because police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"I couldn't take him with me," Ferrell said later.
"What's going on right now is... the culmination of what happened in the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow in the middle of it.
He needs to learn about activism and organization, and at the same time know the different layers of black people's experiences and living conditions and what we need to do to become free and free ourselves.
Even if I manage to raise her in a way that she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she's no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would be doing him a disservice if I protected him from this world."
The first stop they made when they arrived at Ferguson was on South Florissant Road — a spot across the road from the police station that had become a kind of campground where activists were waiting for news of police officer Darren Wilson, who was never charged in the end.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who was preparing lunches.
They put grocery bags together and helped distribute them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new type of activism slowly began to take shape.
"My activism completely changed after Aug. 9," he said, noting that when he was in Missouri-St. A student at Louis University, she was president of the Minority Association of Nursing Students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in Black communities.
"I didn't have any organizing experience.
It all just worked out."
Weeks later, Ferrell met one of the film's co-directors, Sabaah Folayan, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was happening.
A question popped up in Ferrell's head: "Are you trying to document what's going on or find a story that can be exploited?"
This kind of skepticism was the result of countless instances where people — often white-skinned — come into the community and try to capitalize on its pain and resilience.
Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson would not be heard, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already clashed hands with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism regarding prisoners on death row.
His involvement made the project appealing to Ferrell and six other locals who were watched for years by the crew of the film "Whose Streets?" after Brown's shooting.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, but we speak for ourselves," Davis said.
"It was important to me how these people are portrayed because that's how I'm portrayed."
While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience — to show that the movement wasn't about "a redeemer guide, but about bringing the community together," as Folayan said—he became the most open actor in the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he saw the finished piece.
"But I realized that doing this work and humanizing black people has to be accompanied by a certain vulnerability."
What's more, Ferrell's story emphasizes and puts at the center again the role of a black gay woman in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three initiators who came up with a hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the wake of the 2012 killing of a black teenager, Trayvon Martin, are homosexual.
"Black homosexual women in leadership roles have generally sustained the movement," Ferrell said, "and that's because we have to fight on multiple fronts all the time.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden."
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women and many of them are black homosexual women."
However, he argues that "this is not some kind of level-playing field thing" - Ferrell was not chosen as the centerpiece of the film because of his identity.
"He was a person who had the right energy," he said.
"But it's no coincidence that she was right on the front line, because there's a lot at stake in living in such hubs as a black homosexual woman.
His energy can be perceived through the screen."
Meanwhile, news cameras are long gone from Ferguson, but racial ties between the community and police are still fragile.
Ferrell's suspended sentence for blocking the highway during the demonstration will last another 2.5 years.
He describes the socio-political atmosphere in what he calls home, simply a "torrential downpour."
Nevertheless, he still attaches importance to the mantra he has etched into his memory since he took to the streets of Ferguson a full three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our shackles."
7 tips on how to overcome a hangover after a Weekend party
Some of the strongest male sons find that after a snappy party, what's wrong with that, it's helpful.
Or proceed from the saying "avoid a hangover, stay drunk".
But this is just an inevitable procrastination and a decent bounce for health.
What can you do to feel better in the morning after today's and tomorrow's Weekend trolley — or any other party — and overcome the hangover as painlessly as possible?
Drink water.
Down and on alcohol, after a big party in the morning ... or, if possible, even instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid when drinking alcohol, it must somehow be recovered.
Together with water, minerals are washed out of the body, so it is good to drink mineral water.
As the stomach is often irritated after snapping, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or only slightly carbonated.
Go for a walk.
It certainly wouldn't be worth going to your grandmother's house with a hangover to break down trees - this could turn out to be a fatal misjudgment.
But a light walk will help the body again remind you what it's like to be alive.
Lying in a tent and sleeping out a hangover is a more time-consuming way to heal.
Give the body energy back slowly and carefully.
If you're already starting to vomit from yesterday's over-drinking, it's definitely not worth trying to load a big fat steak into your stomach.
For example, start with fresh juice, which contains fruit sugars that quietly nourish your body.
If around noon health is already suffering, then you could try, for example, broth.
And a little later already on the back.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic frees your body from the last bit of water.
As has already been said: water and juice are your friends.
Do not bet on painkillers.
If you take a painkiller in the evening to prevent a hangover, then your liver will have to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol, and thus lose performance.
This way you will spoil your liver even more, and in the future the hangovers will be worse.
In addition, the painkiller does not stay in the body for very long anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, do not do it completely on an empty stomach - this will irritate your already battered stomach.
Or, if there is no partner to take, then get along well with yourself.
It has about the same effect as walking, but you don't get an orgasm when you walk.
However, avoid too active pace and crazy postures - during a hangover, physical exertion should be moderate.
Make fun of it.
Make a fool of yourself with your friends and fellow sufferers, make simple silly things and laugh kindly at yourself and others (suffering).
Jokes and laughter may not drive away the hangover, but they are certainly more fun to endure the aftermath.

Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee wanted as suspects in murder
Police say a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who has become suspects after finding the body of a man with deadly stabbing wounds in one of Chicago's luxury apartments is being searched nationwide.
According to Cook County court documents, arrest warrants were issued Monday without the possibility of bail to arrest 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren on charges of first-degree murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after being stabbed repeatedly.
According to a warning issued to the community by the Chicago Police Department, the body was discovered on July 27.
Police officers received a phone call and found a victim with several stab wounds on her body when they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment building.
Officials say Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and investigators are treating the stabbing as murder, while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university's vice president of public affairs, said in an email statement that Lathem has now been temporarily removed from his job and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is now a criminal case being investigated by competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior assistant in the finance department at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an email statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and ready to help U.S. investigative agencies in any way possible."
In addition, the statement said Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted her to extradite.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of communications at the Chicago Police Department, urges suspects to turn themselves over to authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, but we're working more and more intensively to determine the exact location," Guglielmi said.
Guglielm said local, regional and state authorities alike are helping to search for suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a phone call from the manager of an apartment building in Grand Plaza, who had just received a cryptic clue that something had happened in apartment No. 1008.
According to police reports, it was a gruesome sight.
According to Guglielm, it is not clear whether the event itself also took place on July 27.
He said security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren's presence in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi added.
Grand Plaza management sent a letter to residents: "Police are currently working on identifying the chronology of events and the background of the victim, and are investigating various motives, including the possibility that this was a family dispute."
Startups to help your business avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but the polls were futile.
The answers were often vague, useless or, even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
"This system just wasn't consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs Madison Reed, an e-commerce company that sells hair care products in San Francisco, with 75 employees.
So, he called on external persons to help.
New types of human resources startups are emerging to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software with the specific goal of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide anonymity and a hotline for complaints, and in some cases, allow language carriers to bypass C-level managers and address the board directly.
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit that are designed to monitor health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City startup Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Erretti says in the three years he's been using Glint, he's gotten a much better idea of what his staff is thinking and feeling.
In addition to sudden surveys and surveys aimed at specific teams, it provides a heat map of the company that gives an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing it to identify the causes.
Companies are beginning to realize that they need to stay abreast of their work culture so as not to become the next Uber, which has been embroiled in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing a harrowing environment that punished those who dared to speak out.
For startups like Glint, the desire to have insight is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global area of governance, regulation and compliance could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to fintech statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
Convercent, a Denver-based startup in Colorado that helps businesses prevent and identify inappropriate behavior, observed an increase in interest and activity this year amid Uber's dubious reputation.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send custom impulse surveys, collect confidential responses in real-time, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous messaging line that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
And when the CEO is involved, the complaints go directly to the board.
"Public opinion has been annotated by regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said if a company is found to mistreat its employees or behave unethically, the company could face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts, employee departures and lawsuits, even if regulators don't intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the rules and procedures and provide an easy way to communicate with the corporation's headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report a problem earlier, they had to find the phone number or email address of the corporation's headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a daunting and awkward process, said Ruby Tuesday general counsel James Vitrano, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
However, now that the company uses Convercent, it is possible to identify and address issues such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices that previously did not reach managers who operated in offices in other cities or states more quickly.
"I'm able to get closer to a holistic 360-degree experience for employees," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"And we will protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said companies began taking ethical behaviors, values and employee engagement much more seriously in 2002, after audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
But it wasn't until "social media became mature" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from being publicly washed online.
"Before using technology to track ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies a periodic fee for using their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been supportive of both startups.
Convercent was funded by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital for $10 million in February, raising the value of the capital it raised to $47 million.
Glinti invested $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the company's total funding to $60 million.
Such investments come as no surprise given the interdependence of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing number of studies show that today's employees expect more from the workplace than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes on the table.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued, and that they dedicate their time to a company that has a positive mission.
"When people are happy at the company, feel like they're being listened to, and that the work they're doing is rewarding, they're more committed to the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, who is vice president of the Department for Overall Benefit and Employee Experience on LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn income when the companies in their portfolio do well; Companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, then it's no wonder they find support.
Having data on employee engagement is important, according to experts in work culture.
But this data is useless if the company's supervisors don't do anything with it.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can create expectations that changes lie ahead.
And if change doesn't happen fast enough or not at all, it can lead to frustration and reduce employee engagement.
"When you ask for 4000 proposals, you have to be prepared for 4000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of kotter International, a consulting and business management firm who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
"Because if things don't go to the end, the staff will think, 'Did you actually listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?" "
Erretti said Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly surveys among staff, has been able to implement measures on the same day the issue has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from employees who were disappointed in the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with problems.
However, Ruby Tuesdays is collecting new employee data and it is hoped that in the long run this will lead to a longer-term commitment of employees in an industry known for its high staff turnover.
"If you're not committed to transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
"And when you lose people, you lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you lose businesses."
The Baltics are the shining star of the euro area: incomes are growing fast
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic states are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, bloomberg writes, referring to a report by the European Central Bank.
According to the central bank, since 1999, the gross product of the economy per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
The success is due to low debt levels, rapidly improving institutions and business- and free-market-friendly policies.
"The Baltic states, along with Slovakia, are among the few euro area countries where real GDP per capita in purchasing power has significantly approximated to the EU average", the central bank said.
Although the goal is for the per capita output of the economy to be equal to that of a richer Western Europe, in 2015 the total per capita output of the Baltic economies amounted to only 2/3 of the average of the 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led the Balts to look for better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is also growing this year, the local population is not at all enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies were doing very well, or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, slightly less than half of those surveyed thought so about the economies of their countries.
NCAA's decision to cancel bi-daily workouts makes Bruins' days long
It's almost 8 p.m. when a group of UCLA football players stop to chat at the edge of a new practice field on the team's campus.
Some of them have peeled off their shirts, revealing a sweaty back from the efforts of the first day of their training camp.
For much of the team, these idle minutes provide a midday break.
Players attending summer courses head back to the dormitory after three hours of training to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"The next three days will be a real challenge for them," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA's decision to cancel twice-a-day workouts to reduce the burden on players has actually made their days longer — at least until the final exams are completed Friday.
For that reason, UCLA's first three workouts were scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to fit into the players' already tight schedule.
The transition from two workouts a day means more days with one workout — the bruins training camp start was almost a week ahead compared to last season, and for the first time in Mora's six Westwood seasons, workouts will take place during summer courses.
They have 18 workouts scheduled until Aug. 20 before official preparation for the opening game against Texas A&M in September begins.
Mora says he's in favor of the NCAA's rule change, though it adds another item to the players' busy schedules.
"They have a huge load on three or four days and it's a serious challenge," Mora said.
"And they will break through this trial; They make an effort, they're nice young people.
I think when Saturday comes and we have more time, it's really nice."
Once camp is over, UCLA will make workouts closed, which is by no means an easy task given the clear view of their pitches from a nearby parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, an upper-class hotel that has already been hit by footballs past the defensive net surrounding the goalpost.
Starting this weekend, the hotel will be occupied by Bruins players, but Mora acknowledged that there could be problems with vacant rooms throughout the season.
"We are implementing security measures," Mora said.
"It's a real concern, and it's not at all exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and film a workout from there.
If you have a recording of a workout, it can make a pretty good deal.
But we use a security team there and in the 8th parking lot.
We will do our best using what we have.
I try not to worry much about it.
We have a plan in place."
In retaliation, the Savisaar-Ivanova electoral alliance, which was born for the Centre Party, Kristiina Ojuland, who was expelled from the Reform Party, and Maria Kaljuste, who was forced to leave the BCCI, created by joining forces, Our Tallinn, and the businessmen's electoral alliance Tegus Tallinn, which hopes to show a place to the party members, seem to be participating in the electoral alliances created at the initiative of those who have been scorched in party politics at least as much as political parties are participating in this year's local elections.
However, the chicks will be counted in the fall, and the key question will be whether there will be enough disappointed voters for all of them.
Who will stay with Savisaar?
How small the supporters of Edgar Savisaar have shrunk can be guessed from the events organized in honor of his electoral alliance.
One member of parliament, some former and current centrists and many unknown faces - will that be the composition of the electoral alliance?
And can the reason why some of Savisaar's loyal followers and friends are evading the candidacy in Tallinn be found in the fact that the "Savisaar list" of the losers, headed by corruptors and suspects of corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
A music video for a Russian-language pop song filmed on the roof of the district administration, in which the elder of the Lasnamäe district participates; and a rudimentary computer game in all respects, in which the protagonist, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, has to avoid puddles and squirrels on the road while riding his bike - is this how the Centre Party is trying for the first time for the votes of 16- and 17-year-old voters allowed to enter the ballot box?
We look forward to seeing what other political parties are thinking about a youth-style election campaign.
If the viewers of Kanal 2 or TV3 are faced with a black square instead of an entertainment show from the beginning of August, there will be two choices: to accept that from now on only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and the English-language France24 channels will be seen on free-to-air, or to surrender a dozen to a TV operator every month.
There are probably also those who, at first, are openly delighted with the ad-free TV experience, but in the end - albeit reluctantly - pay for the TV picture and the advertisements.
Deafening music, noisy people and junk left on the streets are unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
However, if you don't want to be part of the fun yourself, it's worth exploring your homeland instead of hurting your head at home - and leaving a sleeping place for a hefty amount for festival guests.
Washington changes green card rules
Media outlets quote President Donald Trump as saying a new U.S. immigration plan is planned that will change green card rules.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 people a year, stricter rules on obtaining temporary work visas, and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
New rules have been proposed by Republicans, and the president supports them.
The bill will be debated in the two houses of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars in taxpayers' money because it changes the way the U.S. issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and begin to replace the current program.
The new application process will give an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the financial means to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy," Trump said, according to media outlets in the United States.
The young people of the Siberian Seto move to the city, the pensioners return to the countryside.
Yevseyev's Anatoly continues the tradition of the once famous Seto gold miners along the Maana River.
He works 140 kilometers from home as a driver in a gold artel on the Kuvai, a tributary of the Maana.
It's tough work: 12 hours of work for two months in a row without days off, and then only ten days at home and back again.
In his three years at Artel, Anatoly has only seen gold once.
"There's a hard order: when you go in, you check thoroughly that you don't bring vodka with you, and when you go out, you don't take the gold with you," says Anatoly.
Mare Piho chatting in haida village with local Seto Jaan, who has told her a lot about her family's memories in Siberia.
The still-preserved archaic culture of the Siberian setos is also beginning to affect the home setos, because it's just so fabulous, thinks Piho Mare, who has studied distant setos most thoroughly.
This year marks the 30th anniversary of his first research trip to Siberia.
During this time, he has been there 14 times and lived there for a total of one year.
How many settlers still migrated out to Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to get land here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I would argue that 8000.
I calculated it from the tales of Siberian Seto men who have also thought about it themselves.
It is difficult to say exactly, because at that time up to 30 people could come in one group, but the passport was given only to a man.
The passport was issued to only one, but with him were children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look at how big this territory was here!
It was many times larger than the historical Setomaa.
After all, it needed to be educated, managed in some way.
The Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed, because here they got into areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (log rafting), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Pechory, many setos later went to work in the classified city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (it was there that the Soviet authorities built a uranium enrichment plant - J. P.), when it was formed.
Did setos make up the majority of the population in this area at the time?
Yes, they lived compactly.
In addition, the tradition of marrying each other and the multi-childishness were preserved for a long time.
Seven or eight children in the family were common.
How much did the culture of the Siberian setos differ and differ from that of the Motherland setos?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought with them a huge number of folk costumes.
They also did (folk costumes) themselves then, but they always made a distinction between what was brought along and what was done here.
Climate change severely affected the traditional outfit of the setos, because it is colder here, after all.
The dishes changed.
For example, in Setomaa, meat was salted, but here it was simply frozen.
Where are the villages of Siberian setos located and what life is lived there? / graphics: Alari Paluots
The bond with the motherland was spiritually strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now this Setumaa is starting to give back there, begins to affect them.
Those girls who have lived here in families have listened to amazing stories.
Piho is referring to the people of the Estonian Seto delegation, who came to haida village at the beginning of July for the day of the Kingdom of Seto and lived in homes for four days - J. P.
What's left here, it's fabulous.
"It is extremely easy to come to Tapa and also to go away, because the city has a great location: at the railway junction and at the intersection of highways", says Reigo Tamm, an opera soloist from Tapa.
The city has long ceased to be just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sports and cultural sites, and you can get pizza on every corner.
Tapa is a top-notch city!
Along the White River, which runs through the city, there is a small islet where the Tapians tend to have a midsummer party.
"You can't see this beautiful place from the train window," Reigo mutters.
Those who are not afraid of cold water can swim in this river, because the river is full of springs.
I've been swimming there though, it's okay!
You can have a picnic on the river and just have a romance - you can look at the flow of the river and think about life in front and behind.
I too have been there for a walk with my brides.
Opera soloist Tamm, in addition to everything else, has gone to the riverbank between the three bridges to practice his arias: "Since this place is on the outskirts of the city, no one may come across as I hum my own stories".
"Männikumäe offers a wonderful view of Tapa, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter and currently play disc golf - the golf course has been made, discs can be rented from the fitness center", directs Reigo.
The old pros go there with their discs, of course, but I haven't gotten there to play yet.
You probably need to invite your colleague Rasmus Kull to visit Tapa, because he is an experienced disc golfer and he has discs.
Maybe he'll lend me!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable from the childhood of the current opera soloist.
At least during ski lessons.
There are many tears, disappointments and victories left on this mountain in my sports life.
Not to mention broken sleds and skis.
"The whole downtown is full of construction work right now, all of this is changing beyond recognition," Reigo praises.
However, the old and tired station building of Tapa is a very attractive place where summer performances are played.
I am glad that in 2012 the head of R.A.A.A.M. Märt Meos accepted my idea and came to the station with his theatre to do summer theatre.
Although this year's theatrical season with "Alexei Karenin" has just come to an end, on August 11, there will be a "Coming to Life" at the railway station, when the old station building moves around in the 1980s.
"From August 11 to 13, tapa city days are the days of the city of Tapa, during which home cafes have been opened in addition to the station building and a number of cultural events take place, including a public rally," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old city just in the days of Noi.
The tiny yellow hut on May 1 boulevard has had a museum since 1994.
"The house is small, but there are a lot of exhibits and a huge amount of information", praises Reigo, a place full of the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on the railway and military.
Reigo smiles that if Tapa goes through all the suggested places, his stomach will be empty for a long time, but fortunately the small town is full of cafes.
"We have such good eateries, and when you sit in cafes, you sometimes get the feeling that you're abroad," he describes.
Educated and young soldiers who have come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so sitting there has a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and in your hometown, but there is such an international company all around.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
There are a lot of soldiers, yes, we have a lot of movement!
In Greece, two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping
The bTV television channel quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as reporting that two Bulgarians were taken into custody for illegal camping in Greece.
Police arrested a group of people camping illegally on the Sithonia Peninsula on the morning of August 1, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but an investigation is currently underway.
The Foreign Ministry told tv channel bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing harsh fines on anyone caught resting in a place not designated for that purpose.
Inspections continue throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court can impose a fine.
Wolves who teach puppies go to break sheep.
After a year's break, the farmers of Hiiumaa will again have to give the wolves "educational material" from their flock - apparently the wolves who taught puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, wolves have broken sheep in Hiiu County three times, a total of 23 sheep and injured eight, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year, the corresponding number was only three, compared to 124 a year earlier.
In sync with the breakups, there is also data from the Environment Agency that no wolf litters were born in Hiiumaa last year and information from the Hiiumaa Hunting Council that two wolf litters have been fixed on the island this year.
On the night before Monday, wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in Emmaste municipality and injured half of the 18 surviving sheep.
Early Wednesday morning, wolves broke one sheep in the pasture of the village of Reheselja and severely injured another, who had to be subjected to an emergency suicide.
Rules for handling GM crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent to the coordination circle the draft Act on the Release of Genetically Modified Organisms into the Environment (GMOVS) and the Draft Act amending the Plant Protection Act.
The amendment to the act abandons the creation of a separate database for both the locations of genetically modified (GM) crops and handlers, for which the plant health register will be used in the future.
In addition, the obligation for the operator of a GM crop to have a prior agreement with a person engaged in beekeeping within the prescribed radius is amended.
Although genetically modified crops are not currently grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and non-genetically modified crops.
This is at least until there is a decision to declare Estonia GMO-free," said Sigmar Suu, Head of the Plant Health Department of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be fit for purpose and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burdens for both the private and public sectors," added Suu.
The bill repeals the provisions related to the GM crop locations and handlers' database and handling training in the GMOVS, establishes requirements for the handling of GM crops and the commencement of economic activities.
Specifically in relation to beekeeping, the existing obligation on the grower of a GM crop to inform beekeepers of the start of cultivation of a GM crop is replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before commencing cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to get acquainted with it in the draft information system and, if they wish, submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes will primarily affect persons active in the field of crop production, beekeepers and the Agricultural Board.
In the European Union, including Estonia, it is allowed to grow only one GM crop - corn MON 810.
So far, however, not a single Estonian farmer has been interested in growing a GM crop.
This is due to the fact that there is no maize pest, the European corn borer, to which the MON 810 maize line is resistant, does not occur in Estonia.
Also, varieties of this corn line are bred for the southern regions, and this corn is not suitable for our climatic conditions.
In order to be sure of the above, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible contamination with GM organisms in the seeds of various varieties of spring rapeseed, maize and soy grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and the study concluded that the seeds of the rapeseed, maize and soy varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
From the above, it can be concluded that no genetically modified crops are knowingly grown in Estonia, and it was also confirmed that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited a "genius" in the form of Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have recruited a "genius" in the form of Nemanja Matic after midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The player, bought over from Chelsea for £40m, started a 2-1 win in the starting line-up on Tuesday in United's last pre-season game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid in Dublin, impressing in a defensive role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on offensive tours.
But having been sidelined from the Blues' pre-season Asian tour, Matic was sorely lacking match form and only lasted 45 minutes. This, according to Mourinho, needs to be fixed before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has the experience, the intelligence, the brilliant mindset — he has a football mindset," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Matic, other new-recruited Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the starting line-up at Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho quietly began to set up his eleven starting men for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed the club has already done a "great job" by signing contracts with three of his four priority picks.
"I'm grateful to the club for being able to make three of the fours," he added.
"I'll be even happier if they can make it four out of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another sockpuppet got a GSM transmitter on his leg on August 1, and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a birdwatcher who lives in Sõrve, the first stork was accompanied by Sõrves, and this litter is already flying around, has left the nesting site and joined the large overnight collection of Mullutu-Suurlahe.
This is because there are no grain fields in Sõrve, writes The Voice of the Islands.
This Tuesday, relatively late for the ringing of the gorges, another stork was attached to the escort, and this on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is actually an international project, driven by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a stork boy named Mati was equipped with a GSM transmitter in Sõrves Türjul.
"His activities can all be viewed online: how he went to hibernate in Spain, when he returned, he stuck for a long time on the German-Polish border, and then came to Saaremaa," Martinson said.
The British inventor had a microchip installed in his body to get into the house and car with a wave of his hand
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip so that he could open his front door with a mere wave of his hand, get into the office and even start a car.
Steven Northam, 33, had a tiny chip installed between his thumb and forefinger, and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hants, Winchester, to ensure the installation procedure meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip for cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The Northam company is also replacing the locks in houses and cars to make them compatible with the chip, charging £300 for one lock.
This married father of one child has now installed the technology both in his home and in his car BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibit cost taxpayers thousands
According to military documents released to TIME magazine, the White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the Southern Yard last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000 for an event celebrating American production.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, dubbed the Marine One while the president was on board, was the central attraction of an event showcasing American construction programs at the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured industrial products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, built in Connecticut, was exhibited along with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift made in Mississippi.
According to documents from the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) squadron squadron, which is responsible for operating the helicopter, the White House military office required the helicopter's presence with a partial command, or FARGO, just under 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the southern yard for an "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because it's an unusually high-profile event," the HMX-1 commander said in an email the day before the event to his boss, the Navy's deputy chief officer in the aviation industry.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive in the south yard around 7 p.m. on the morning of July 17 for the event beginning at 3 p.m. and will remain there until the yard is cleared between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. that night.
Added was the fact that should the departure from the White House be delayed, a second escort would be required for the return flight due to working time restrictions.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, and the squadron's security team stayed close to the aircraft for the entire duration of its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to find out from the documents given to TIME magazine whether or not a second escapade was finally needed.
Hatch's law prohibits federal workers from using government property for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether this event could violate this provision.
"We asked if it violated Hatch's law and were told not to violate it," the commander wrote.
"You don't seem to have a choice," the deputy commanding officer replied.
The White House declared the event "American-made" an official event, and Hatch's law wouldn't have covered it.
But even official events have political undertones.
At the event, the president backed the efforts for health care reform that were then under discussion in the Senate and praised efforts to keep government regulations in check.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically lucrative purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely for a photo session is unusual.
Trump came under scrutiny in February when a presidential plane rolled into the background at his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is riddled with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the president's plane.
"White House is very pleased with the 'American-Made' exhibit, which featured products from all 50 states made from American workers from American materials," said Lindsay Walters, acting White House spokeswoman.
HMX-1 teams often make test flights around Washington and in the south yard to practice putting down at the White House of the President of the United States with centimetre accuracy.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 held 58 test landings in the White House courtyard.
According to the official, the flight to the event was counted among the "American-made" flight attendants' standard for training flights that month.
The squadron's helicopters flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
According to the White House, no other exhibit at the event burdened the taxpayer's wallet.
According to a representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in organizing an exhibit in the southern yard of the helicopter.
The HMX-1 does not keep budget documents for the president's flights, and it is difficult to figure out the exact cost of the event.
But according to the Department of Defense's hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the VH-3D compensation rate is $24,380 per flight hour.
Squadron documents indicated the length of the flight from its main base at Navy Quantico Airfield, Virginia, for 30 minutes in each direction.
The White House argues that the actual cost of using the helicopter is well below that amount.
"It's very misleading to calculate taxpayers' costs based on estimated reimbursement rates," Walters said.
"These estimated reimbursement rates shall include staff, maintenance and other sunk costs to be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the Department of Defense's compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but they do cover fuel, maintenance, and contract costs.
Sean Spicer, a former White House spokesman, defended the use of the helicopter at the event at the time.
"The point is to show things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be contributing to our national security and that there are presumably hundreds, if not even thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So, of course, it's right to highlight that."
It's not clear if Trump was exposed to a helicopter while touring the South Yard as part of the event or not, but he did sit behind the wheel of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky's representatives, making fun of media outlets about the company's products in his personal fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of their products."
Grit Šadeiko - peace and joy came through tears
At the 2011 World Cup in Daegu, Šadeiko was hit in the final area, a leg cramp in the 800m run, and a stretcher was taken away from the stadium.
Just before that, he had scored zero in the long jump at the Universiade held in China.
The 2012 Helsinki EMI was ruined by an injury in the javelin, but at the debut Olympics held in London, he finished 23rd with 6013 points.
However, the misfortune continued.
At the 2013 World Championships in Moscow, after the opening day, the Estonian woman, who was on the chart for the Estonian record, suffered a thumb injury in the long jump.
Two years later, he finished 15th at the Beijing World Cup and met the Olympic standard, but that was also disappointing for the athlete who wanted more.
Šadeiko only passed the heaviest slingshot last year when he failed to score in the long jump at the Amsterdam EMI at first.
I'd just like to put together a decent multi-race once.
Once", Shadeiko confessed.
Worse was yet to come: a month later, his Olympic competition in Rio was interrupted due to a thigh injury already at the first hurdle.
Time had to be taken down - to continue with the seven-race at all?
Is two days of effort still worth it all?
The girl thought for a long time, but found peace in herself.
I got to clear my head
It's a relatively difficult experience to describe, but I've been thinking that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal myself and think about keeping my head clean.
"I knew I wouldn't put the pills in my bag yet," Shadeiko says of her self-cleaning.
I was able to turn the clean sheet and move on with renewed vigor.
According to coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the ward, but she understood that above all, the athlete himself must be clear.
He was, after all, so buried by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"But Grit said he wouldn't give up and he wanted to prove to himself what he was worth," says Hill.
Now there is some kind of peace in him.
He does it for his own pleasure.
The competition came back in May, when Šadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points in the Götzis multi-event.
In the high-level race, he improved his personal top mark in the shot put by nearly a metre (13.89) and ran a record time in the hurdles.
Then the multi-racer sensed that this was by no means a ceiling of ability, but that all that was extinguished was the initial hunger for competition.
Mägi, who has coached him for years, says that Šadeiko is a pattern student.
He is a ready-made athlete, he is good to train.
If something makes trouble or is wrong, he will say it right away.
He knows his own body and trusts his cognition.
That is the starting point.
I cannot say what exactly needs to be done and we will follow it.
Shadeiko has also found a new approach.
"I'm not the kind of person who makes the most of training," he says, and says that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
Baby happiness of loved ones makes you happy
Good emotions have also been offered to Šadeiko by the happiness of loved ones.
Both her former training partner Maris Mägi and sister Grete recently became parents, and the multi-racer has received support from new weathermen.
"It's been pretty interesting," says Shadeiko.
One alcohol, drinking which equals "training" the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big fan of wine that he believes — wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
According to him, it is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the "very active" process of tasting wine.
By sniffing the glass, spinning the wine in our mouths, enjoying it and perceiving the aftertaste, we put our brains to work to create flavor for the wine.
According to Sheperd, wine molecules don't actually contain flavor, but the flavor comes from the way wine stimulates the brain.
He brings for comparison how the brain "sees" colors.
"The taste is not in the wine, the taste creates the wine taster", says Sheperd.
Things that still influence the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender and even the amount of saliva that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, admonishes that wine isn't there to drink yourself full.
"There has to be more to the action," he says.
If you take too large a sip, the system will be oversaturated.
Excessive drinking of wine can harm the brain instead of benefit - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine risk memory loss, loss of balance and decreased mental capacity.
10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector are paid less than their colleagues
Data from the recruitment company Fontes reveals that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive less than their colleagues.
The ten percent pay gap is between men and women, writes portal Genius.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in fontes' ICT sector salary survey.
A total of 8,577 posts were surveyed.
63% of the positions were occupied by men.
"Although only 3 companies stated that the pay gap is in favor of men and in the opinion of the rest of the companies there is no pay gap, in reality, compared to similar jobs, men's monthly basic salary is on average 10% higher than that of women, and the total annual salary of men is on average 8% higher than that of women," said Ilmar Põhjala, an analyst at Fontes.
Promotional clip for "Narcos" Season 3: Now that Pablo Escobar is gone, Cal's cartel takes center stage in Netflix's hit series
Despite the fact that the killer of Pablo Escobar was revealed in the second season of "Narcos", the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have received confirmation from the streaming service, and the first of them has already been produced a promotional clip teasing the series with new villains.
In the third season, the DEA turns its attention to the richest drug trafficking organization in the world - the Cali cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful godfathers "like a Fortune 500 company," simply with more bribes to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the head of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) its brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages ties with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a newly released promotional clip, Pedro sees Pascali returning as Javier Pena, a character who recruits American and Colombian law enforcement to help in the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of "Narcos" will kick off on Sept. 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN assistance mission, said hundreds of women are running in local council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of recently registered voters are women.
"It is not possible to exaggerate the importance of the role of women," she said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only truly represent the people and be credible if women participate fully and are involved at all stages of the electoral process.
Elections to Afghanistan's local councils and presidential elections will be held on April 5.
For their part, the Taliban have threatened an electoral process coinciding with a transition period in which the role of international military operations will become consultative.
This year's elections mark the first time that power is calmly transferred from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women increases the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to afghanistan's independent election commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The joy of sharing makes every thing more awesome in both big and small.
There is always too little time together, but training with taurus provides a good opportunity to combine togetherness, play, intimacy and load.
And what a convenient solution - no matter where you cruise in the summer, you will always have live dumbbells with you and impatiently remind you with your slender voice: "Let's work out now!"
Start with a warm-up - an ordinary hawk game or flagging along the beach strip is very good.
The squat is the mainstay of keeping the legs and buttocks in shape - so who would want to take the shape of a sand cake washed away by the waves over the summer?
It's wonderful to use kids instead of a lever!
First of all, it is safe and comfortable, the weight gradually grows at the same pace as the strength of the trainer.
The advanced ones can also do squats with pretty big kids.
The child trains balance, reads repetitions and enjoys the opportunity to lean high and be important.
Larger children can do their own squats at the same time.
The range of motion is determined by touching the ground and stretching your arms up.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the mini-assistant to hold on properly.
The child can read repetitions and feel like a coach.
Plank is a super useful, but hopelessly boring exercise for a child.
But it's easy to make things more fun!
Game-plank: Take a long plank column to take turns crawling through.
In fact, harder than usual, but much more fun to do when in the meantime you can give a hand to a friend.
To add to the load, you can stay on the plank, tiny on the withers, and also walk around in this position.
As an added weight, the smallest child can be made to sit on the hips, but this exercise will be fun for all children.
While crabs slip on the sand, the triceps, buttocks and abdominal muscles receive a load like a naksti.
The child descends to his feet in such a way that his body weight is equally distributed forward and backward.
For safety, hands can be held.
Bend your legs and stretch straight up.
Taurus can fly, have fun, train balance and be a weight.
The life of a little coach is extra-fun when he gets a little kiss every time he comes up.
An additional load is given by stretching the legs in advance.
Check that your back is in a neutral position.
In the children themselves, it is much more fun to do the abdominal muscles in a pair and with a clap.
A squat with handiwork and pulse.
Monitor the safety of the child, the position of the knee, and keep your back in a neutral position.
Favorite of all the children and great fun!
For a parent yet a truly effective full-body workout.
The sports equipment was Ott (10), Säde (8), Luck (4).
From the Philippines to the wide world, or The Straw Bag's Journey to the Hearts of Fashion Fans
The straw-braided bags are a summer classic that has become a hit product in its own right in recent years, which the right summer lover even has to hang on his hand and has been able to weld a price tag suitable for the hit by merchants, despite its modest origins.
A straw-braided bag is probably one of those things that everyone has had once in their lives, and owning one of them hasn't evoked any particular emotions.
It's just there, and if it's not, then nothing is broken either.
Now, however, straw bags are making a real triumph, and fashion fans have swapped their exquisite designer bags for simple straw-braided bags for the summer months.
It's not just a beach bag, but today it's just as popular as a street bag, and braver women even walk into the office with it.
At this point, however, it's worth making it clear beforehand whether a summer look like this for your boss is still sitting or whether it's still worth pushing the booze and laptop into a slightly more formal sumadan.
However, variety has made straw bags a real love of summer for women.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing that catches my eye is that fashion connoisseurs are the first thing to do on a holiday trip to the local market and buy themselves a straw bag, which they will then be faithful to throughout the holiday season and which will accompany them on the beach, at the market and also hanging out with their girlfriends in the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy a larger pile of bags from the market and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.
It's worth noting that the demand for bags is so high among readers that in the real world, women (and men!) would probably go hand-in-hand at each other to become the happy owners of some bags.
In a way, this kind of madness is also understandable, because it is rare to be able to buy a thing that has risen to hit status in the fashion world for just a few tens of euros.
True, cunning merchants have also discovered a simple way to make money here, and so finer luxury brands also sell straw bags for a few hundred and thousands of euros.
Probably so that richer customers don't have to feel like simple mortals promenading around with some kind of cheap bag.
For example, you can buy yourself a Dolce & Gabbana straw bag that costs more than a thousand euros.
However, for the interpretation of Chanel's straw bag, you can come up with around 6000 euros.
Unlike most fashion hits, however, straw bags don't come from some big fashion meccas, but their story started farther away.
The straw bags are said to have originated in the far Philippines, where they have been carried in wide weather.
Braiding a straw bag is primarily an expo business there, and you don't see locals walking around with them very often.
The straw braiding technique is said to date back to the 14th century and is quite sarane with the usual basket weaving.
However, since the straw bag does not need to be braided as strongly as the basket, patterns and other materials can be embedded in them, which will make the bag more personal and, by extension, more active.
For example, bags with colored ribbons or leather strips braided are especially trendy lately.
However, a letter of thanks could be sent by straw bags to actress Jane Birkin, the biggest braided straw bag fan of whom had never been seen before.
Namely, he matched the straw bag to all sorts of outfits and didn't think it would be much to even go to the Cannes Film Festival with it.
However, the fact that caring for them is a rooster's head, and unlike all sorts of other sumadans, they do not have to be cared for with special means, but water and a wet towel also do not play a minor role in the popularity of bags today.
As always with trend rattlesnakes, in addition to the classic look, brands have come up with all sorts of interpretations.
For example, if you wish, you can buy yourself a straw-braided riding sleeve or a tiny shoulder bag.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that a classic straw bag will never go out of fashion, but a straw bag will.
But, then, what is the classic straw bag?
For centuries, such a straw-braided bag, reminiscent of a basket in its style, is open on top and has short, as well as straw, handles on it, has been considered classic.

GMB worries about investments in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The trade union is waiting for executives at cookie maker McVitie's to confirm long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland says the company has been silent about the future of the Tollcross site investment.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, said they had invested more than £5 million in the site over the past few years.
More workers were hired there, and union presidents "are the first to hear" when something changes in the plant's operations.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland approached McVitie's with a request to "dissect concerns about the funding not being used to modernise production lines".
Drew Duffy, GMB's senior organizer, said: "The fact that we are not getting clarity from the site's chief executive about Tollcross's business needs and future investment plan is deeply troubling our members.
Several generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people around Glasgow, being an indispensable pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and welfare, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs and a chronic decline in production, eastern Glasgow is in dire need of a thriving company at McVitie."
A Pladis representative said: "Tollcross's site manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company responds directly to him as we value active interaction with workers and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting between workers and GMB representatives was held in Tollcross, where a number of issues were openly discussed.
We then discussed with the employees that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our companies and objects - to ensure that we are competitive.
He added: "In recent years we have invested over £5 million in the Tollcross site, most of it has gone to production lines and operations improvement.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as a manufacturing site, and should there be any change in the operation of the site, the workers and union representatives will be the first to hear about it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona against approaching Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up in attempts to lure Neymar into its ranks by making a £189 million bid to buy him out. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record-breaking conquest?
This sensational approach has opened the summer transfer window and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the current world record for more than double the over-buying set last season with Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United for £89m.
Once the transition is completed, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world as a result, and also the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, who will receive a salary of over £500,000 a week from PSG after taxes.
Barcelona are known to be angry at both the way they approach and the break-up of Neymar free, although a source close to Catalans' board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the footballer since his arrival at Santos in 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the football world of such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing a contract with Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi sternly warned all clubs thinking about recruiting some of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we'll confront them and contact those players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they're trying to sign a contract with one of our players, they're going to have to face the consequences."
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not let the Italian leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could get a setback as a result of that interest, losing one of their precious assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders, after Brexit.
"Brexit threatens to seriously drive a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland since taking office in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from this," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible, Varadkar said.
"This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders," he stressed.
Varadkar said he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and, if it cannot, remain part of the European single market.
This would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to streamline Britain's departure would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, the Irish prime minister explained.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We could certainly have one with Britain".
An alternative to this would be a return to customs posts that would herald historical divisions and political failure.
"A barrier to trade, prosperity and peace," the Irish prime minister said.
He called Brexit "a challenge for our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of northern Ireland's daily life.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of northern Ireland's main political parties during a visit to Belfast.
Märt Avandi, who completed his first half-length triathlon: anyone can complete the Ironman.
Today, the largest triathlon festival in the Baltics was held in the winter capital Otepää, when about a thousand triathletes from over thirty countries entered the half-length Ironman competition.
The 70.3 mile distance consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, Märt Avandi triumphantly finished the first triathlon of his life.
"I thought it would be difficult and in the end it was difficult," Avandi said at the finish.
Despite the complexity, Avandi admitted that triathlon is actually affordable for almost everyone.
"It's not the distance that kills, it's the pace that kills," he said, hinting that almost everyone would make it to the finish line at a feasible pace.
With the exception of Ott Sepp: "Oti's physique is fine, but alas, he does not know how to swim".
Avandi had been working out eagerly since February.
At first 4-5 hours a week, and later already ten hours a week.
With a time of 05:34:12, he finished 270th overall.
Although Avandi lost to both Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (time 05:06:37), he defeated other competitors in the so-called "prominent class".
Tanel Padar, who was a "good role model" last year, lost to Avant in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18, respectively).
German Johannes Moldan was crowned the overall winner of the men's event at the Otepää stage, which is part of the Ironman series, with a time of 3:58:27, the best of the Estonians was Ivo the Great with a time of 04:14:09.
Among the women, Danish Helle Frederiksen won with a time of 04:24:01, while the Estonians beat Maria Rabbit, who lost to Frederiksen in nearly half an hour and finished with a time of 04:58:58.
Avandi completed the 1.9 km swimming distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
Out of the water, he came in the 410th position.
