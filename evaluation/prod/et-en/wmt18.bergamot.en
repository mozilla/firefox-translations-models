Four members of the Kemerovo group detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the Post, police detained Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group in the Estonian underworld, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovsky, was detained by police in Spain.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with court permission.
Yesterday, the court also took three suspects detained in custody in Estonia.
The suspect is said to be members of the so-called Kemerovo Crime Society aged 27-57, mainly committing drug offences.
The alleged leader of a criminal association has been detained in Mija, Malaga province, Spain.
Three men were detained on suspicion in Estonia, one of whom is a leading figure in the criminal association and two are members of the criminal association, according to the data collected.
The data collected indicate that the roles and roles were clearly distributed in the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal association's activities was to commit drug offences and thus generate criminal proceeds," said Mr Verte, head of pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case.
"We are not ruling out that the number of suspects in this case will increase," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been in the interest of law enforcement authorities in the past, and some have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish counterparts has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of the collaboration," said prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the CCC, said the arrests were preceded by a pro-life investigation, which lasted nearly a year and a half.
"In the first half of the year, the long-running work came to fruition and we simultaneously detained suspects in crimes in Estonia and in Spain," he said.
Leis added that Central Criminal Police officers were assisting in the arrests in Spain.
For years now, we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and civil wearables.
These arrests are another message to criminals that we can get them from the other end of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that the men on suspicion of assault can continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecution has requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting surrender to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash have been seized in this criminal case to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings in the case are carried out by the Central Criminal Police Organised Crime Bureau and led by the Crown Prosecution Service.
Slava Gulevitich was convicted of racketeering in 2005 by a district court in Tallinn and sentenced to five years in prison.
In the middle of last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world, after then-League leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began to engage in extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxidermy and prostitutes operating at various hotels and charged businessmen with monthly rookie fees.
International joint operations, confiscation of criminal proceeds and court rulings that have come into force confirm that the fight in the area of organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest convictions, eight defendants separated from the so-called Dikayev Crime Association criminal case, who had their criminal assets of EUR 80,000, or the judgment of nine individuals in 2006 for Igor Aleynikov to set up a criminal association aimed at the illegal trade of cigarettes and committing crimes related to human trafficking in East Virginia and the South of Estonia.
Confird criminal revenue there is around 71,500 euros.
In these criminal matters, it has ensured that police officers exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and, if necessary, conduct will be carried out together in any European Union country.
Civil rights group warns against travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri against discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state.
The group's statement reads: "A NAACP travel note issued for the state of Missouri, which is valid until August 28, 2017, calls on all African-Americans, visitors and Missourians to be particularly attentive and extremely careful as they move around the state, taking into account the entire suspicious racially-based events that have occurred recently across the state."
The NAACP said the group urged both the recent Missouri law making it harder to win discrimination lawsuits and the fact that state law enforcement officers are targets for an unequal proportion of minorities.
"People's civil rights are violated.
They are pulled to the side of the road because of the color of their skin, beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri branch of the NAACP, told The Kansas City Star.
'We've never had so close complaints before.'
It is the first such warning the organization has issued about the U.S. state.
The group cited events such as racist insults at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of petrol while driving through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note refers to a recent report by the Missouri attorney general's attorney general, which shows that in the state, black motorists are 75% more likely to be stopped than those of white people.
"It's designed to make people aware and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared, whether it means taking bail money or informing relatives that they're going through the state," he said.
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, Missouri documented 100 hate crimes in 2015, putting the state 16th in the state's penetrating number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it harder for the company to sue for discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union of the ACLU had previously issued travel updates on Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws requiring local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because the ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
Typically, travel warnings are issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently, interest groups have started using the measure as a counter-reaction to certain intra-U.S. laws and trends.
Hepatitis: what would anyone know about different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, can be caused by five different - A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses trigger acute inflammation of liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C are a poor cost, which can develop into cirrhosis of the liver, or liver wrinkles and liver cancer.
Moothodology adviser to the Department of Health says the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, sneezing, numb urine, muscle and joint pain, and the collarbone of the skin and mucus.
The most recent disease recognition of liver inflammation also comes from the popular name collie disease.
In children, hepatitis can go ahead without disease.
Different types of inflammation can only be determined on the basis of data from laboratory studies.
Extreme hepatitis can switch to chronic hepatitis and run for decades without signs of disease, which means a person may not know anything about their dangerous liver-related disease.
Mr Kutsar points out different forms of hepatitis and describes their progress more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from sick people and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, through sex, from stools to hands and hands to food, objects, mouth and drug use.
Family members and carers of the disease, those who are infected with hepatitis A, or at-risk groups, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with an infected person, men having sex with men, drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with high hepatitis A.
Infectiousness can be prevented by vaccination, in particular for people travelling at risk of vaccination and those at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, daily hygiene requirements are essential: wash or disinfect all fruit and vegetables before using them for food.
Hepatitis B viruses spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, hole-in-arming, blood-testing creatures (toothbrushes, treatments), donor blood, having sex with a hepatitis cabal person, and having hepatitis from mother to foetus/born.
The risk of hepatitis B infection includes injection drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, health care, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and travelers visiting countries with high hepatitis B.
It is possible to vaccinate people for hepatitis B; in particular, people at risk have been recommended, as well as those with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis include: avoiding the use of alien hygiene and manicured equipment, other sharpeners and systolic ants, tattooing and looting, and using a condom for condoms for infectious sex or avoiding sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is free for children in Estonia as part of the national immunisation scheme and is free for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, hole-in-arming, using blood-contaminated creatures, having a donor blood, having sex with hepatitis, and from hepatitis to mother to foetus/nonnavigation.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injection drug users, infected person sex partners, men having sex with the infected mother, family members and caregivers, health care workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, HIV infections and travelers visiting countries with hepatitis C.
The prevention measure for hepatitis is: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicure products, other sharpeners and needles, tattooing and fracking, and using condoms for infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
As a result, hepatitis D infection occurs in combination with hepatitis B or a superficial infection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread through contact with blood and other bodily fluids, with contaminated needles, sexually transmitted and rarely infected mother to the fetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis viruses spread through drinking water and food, including eating low-heated beef, fish and sea cucumbers, donor blood, commonly used syringes and infected mother to fetal fetus.
Travellers may be infected with hepatitis in countries with high rates of hepatitis.
Hepatitis prevention measures include meeting hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Trees and vegetables to wash before consumption, avoid eating low-profile beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
While rivals tried to sprint off the four-time Olympic champion in the final round, 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final and won in a time of 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think long, pulling his wife Tania and the children along the way after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
It was wonderful to be on the road with them," Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for a fifth title race in London in a row with a 5,000 and 10,000 meters run golden duo.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor dines in "Daam in Gold. The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the extraordinary story of the birth of a artwork of one art, is much deeper into the cultural life of late 19th and early 20th-century Vienna.
But even more in history.
Awe-inspiring amount of information might have been worn out, perhaps a louder twist; a narrower subject would have allowed the portrait allowed in the title to become more of an influence.
At present, there would be two books on the same cover: the story of Gudele Klimt and his painter "Daam in Gold," Adele Bloch-Bauer, and a much larger and more comprehensive historical book about the esteemed Jewish family and the German occupation, along with its after-effects in Austria.
The first third of the book takes the cultural life of Vienna in the middle of a bustling Vienna, and whoever finds itself in the Austrian capital can imagine, without the slight effort, how life went around Ringstrasse more than 100 years ago, or how everyone turned their heads in the Central Cafe when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe's richest cities, and when you see a name you know in the book, you feel like you're more cultured.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud operated in a city where incurable syphilis and had the highest suicide rate in Europe does nothing more to the development of the story.
Or perhaps, anyway, each of the twigs of a pair of brushes adds colours to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
The dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, nearly one in ten residents of Vienna was Jewish.
Adele's parents were also newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married herself twice to open a Czech sugar magnate, Ferdinand Bloch, and Klimt was posing for her famous paintings, her father had become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adelet didn't draw all the glamorous life to which she belonged.
If you look at "Damid in gold," it's hard to believe that, towards the end of his life, this great lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of travelling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to commission a portrait of his wife from Klimt, the last moment was the most hotter painter in Vienna.
Klimt's order at the time cost 4,000 kronor, a quarter of the price of a well-placed country house.
The sugar magnate was not deterred by the fact that some of the portraits were suspicious of the master's love affair with the model.
As for Adele, the only sure fact is that the relationship between the model and the artist that has emerged during the work continued until the end of life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Daam in Gold.
Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the extraordinary story of the Adele Bloch-Bauer portrait, Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randland.
Shortly before the work began with Adele, Klimt had been in Ravenna in San Vitale, a basilica, and investigators believe it was the glory mosaics seen there from Emperor Theodora that gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele as a mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Damid Gold" in Vienna in 1908, and around the same time (between 1907 and 1908), another golden painting was born.
Art historians didn't go unnoticed by the two women's similarities.
How about Hitler?
"I think, for the memory of my friend Klimt, I owe him to make his handiwork available to the public," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote to the director of the Belvedere Museum a few years after the artist's departure (Klimt died in February 1918) and asked their family's Klimt collection to go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had produced another portrait of Adele.
Also in his testament (Adele passed away in February 1925), she asked her husband to leave his two portraits and four of Gustav Klimt's landscape paintings for the Austrian Gallery.
She inherited her jewelry to her sisters Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt had graduated from the "Austrian Mona Lisa," 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to get to Vienna's Academy of Fine Arts, but failed a drawing.
Although Hitler's later anti-Semitism is sometimes considered to be because he was not accepted by Jewish professors at the academy, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the Austrian Gallery, referred to in Maria's testament, had changed considerably in 1939 - it was important to find work appealing to the Nazi party from Vienna's rich Jewish art collections.
Some of the work at home in Adele's home, but not Klimt's, was also suited to Hitler's personal art treasure.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery, a 10-year legal dispute between the Austrian government and the heirs of Bloch-Bauers began.
All that is to say, if "Suicide" is seen at Belvedere Castle in Vienna, "Day in Gold" will have to go to New York's Neue Gallery to see Adele Bloch-Bauer.
And before the trip to Vienna, read the above book.
Even if you don't plan to go see Klimt's work, because at least my emotions revolved around more Nazi and Jewish after the book was closed than the painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer sold for 135 million dollars.
So not so much a portrait, rather than a story of the fate of the family - and a very moving story.
Notably, the Bauer family tree, listed at the beginning of the book, facilitated the orientation of events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the record in Canada
In the premiership, Gold was very close to his personal record of 200m backstroke swimming in 2.16.62.
The peak marks date back to the 17-year-old from a week ago when the Canadian junior championships hit 2.16.58, the Priit Aviva Swimming blog reports.
Gold finished last in the 10th A-League final.
He went the distance in the final with a time of 2.15.76 and finished well in seventh place with a powerful new top-four finish.
A little more than half a second of Gold's record (2.15.13), which is owned by Alina Kendziori, was separated by just over half a second.
Gold climbed to third in the all-time rankings and its latest personal best is the fifth highest ever score in Estonia.
The young hopeful is still in the 100m, 200m and 400m at the Canadian Adult Championships, and in the 200m and 400m.
Last week, the Canadian junior championships took place in Toronto, and Gold made successful starts there.
She won a silver medal in the 200m freestyle in 2.03.22.
So quickly, this distance was last swamped by the defending champion in 2008.
Only Estonian record-holder Elina Partõka has swapped this distance in Estonia.
The Canadian-born champion still won bronze in the 100m freestyle with a superb personal record and a new season with a top-five finish of 56.66.
Kert Ly Alnek, a year older than him, for example, has swapped this distance just one century faster.
He reached a personal top mark of 1.03.69 in the 100m backstroke in the opening swagger of the relay.
At half-time, he only reached seventh when he swam in 2.17.31 in the final.
Gold is currently leading the rankings for the season at four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics grit their teeth
The holiday season is now - it also means relaxation for US President Donald Trump.
But since Trump has been one of the most vacation days so far, critics are already grinding their teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president is scheduled to spend a 17-day vacation at a golf club named Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the president's holiday began yesterday, Trump's opponents have been speaking out for a week on the holiday.
They're throwing too many flimsy rest for Trump.
Indeed, it is customary for the president to spend weekends in his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey villas.
By the way, Trump isn't the most rested president in his 196 days in office.
For example, George W. Bush has already been on leave for 67 days in that time, while Barack Obama was half as many as Trump, only 21 days.
But things tend to be quickly forgotten by Trump.
Days after becoming president, Trump said on "60 Minutes" that there would be no time for the long vacations during his time in office because there was a lot of work to be done.
He also expressed outrage three years ago about Barack Obama's holiday.
The current president wrote on Twitter at the time: "While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, attending parties and jungle concerts, ISIS is cutting heads for journalists."
According to White House officials, the 17-day visit to the golf club is no relaxation.
Instead, it's officially called a working holiday, during which Trump doesn't have time to read or other mindfulness.
There was also another reason for the working holiday.
Specifically, the White House's western wing conditioning system is being replaced, so all staff had to leave.
There is also the Oval Office and other presidential workspaces in the West wing.
"I don't think any of you want to be in the West Side in August if it's 38 degrees and no air conditioning," said Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman who emphasized that the president would continue to work while on vacation.
Where President Trump spends the next 17 days, you get a glimpse of the video.
Blocking critics on Facebook - don't stand up for public office unless you tolerate voter criticism
Our father knew a lot about unfavourable media coverage.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start pitching him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he didn't make his critics silence.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "freedom of expression can be taken away from us and, in silence, we may be driven to carnage like sheep."
That brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work harder to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who posted their views on his official Facebook page.
And earlier this week, the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) sued him for so.
The governor's administration tweeted the lawsuit null and void, and online comments echoed the "Who cares?"
"It's just Facebook," many said.
But that matters.
And that matters a lot when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
It's an astonishingly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
His approval rate ranks second among the state's 50 governors.
Hogan is not an unthinkingly responsive mood.
He has steered the state firmly and has maintained his principles rigorously.
In addition, he has used Facebook rather profusely as a key tool for communicating with his constituents, for example, for example, posing with his fist of a sneaky head for the first time after chemotherapy.
So the governor's page - which is a public forum with official label, managed by the blocking of people who receive taxpayer dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's behavior in an interview with The Washington Post, saying the blocking of the comments was nothing more than a molestation.
But it's all too easy to paint a picture of online trolls, spamstars or people full of hate.
The Post spoke to several real people that Hogan blocked.
And that's what they're real people who interact with their elected leaders. Teacher, business owner and pastor, not internet trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not at all rough.
Pastor quoted the Bible in his post, insisting on Hogan's Catholicism.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Rama Raman, from Bowie, Maryland, didn't incite anger, but about hate crimes.
"I politely stated that I was disappointed that he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in a commentary on The Post's news story.
'I don't like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same subject, some immediately call it an indifferent collective effort, rather than admitting that they are a big deal of worried citizens.'
What the governor's administration called a "directed spam attack" would probably be called "public support" by others.
The Facebook era allows messages to be easily matched by simply blocking a critic or deleting negative comments.
It's much cleaner than it used to be, when workers had to be expelled to do the same, to collect newspapers with critical headlines and burn them or arrest the protesters and force them to remain silent.
But that's exactly what's happening now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first state official to be criticized for biting Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has sued Twitter users who have blocked his Twitter feed.
One of the first landmark judgments on the subject was in Virginia last week.
U.S. District Judge James C. In Cacher, Alexandria ruled that the chairwoman of the Loudoun County Supervisory Board violated the first amendment of the Constitution when he blocked a voter from his Facebook page.
In Kentucky, the ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
During the Washington era, affordable postal costs had a similar effect than the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1,800, the number of newspapers quadrated the number of newspapers and anonymous pundits scoffed at his way of governing.
And even then, Washington had to face anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington's decisions.
According to historical documents collected as part of a project of online George Washington's collection of letters, he hid a cabinet under petitions criticising his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he didn't force them to remain silent.
Freedom of expression, dissent and debate are the foundations of our country.
And proper leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home territory at Renaissance Club
Former European frontman Ronan Rafferty is hoping for the comfort of his home territory over the next three days when the 25th anniversary of the East Lothian Renaissance Club golf course. Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who was in the main event last year on the nearby Archerfield Links track before signing Paul Eales, has been fond of the new venue and will play the role of tournament ambassador in place of the club's founder and chief executive Jerry Sarvad.
"I saw the Renaissance Club built and now we see the club shining in full glory with this event," Rafferty said.
'The players see the track in their best shape, it's in a brilliant position.
Jerry has done an excellent job building this place.
He is an avid supporter of the game of golf and is proud of what he has achieved here.
It makes it possible to present the track perfectly."
The Englishman is looking forward to being able to defend the championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a very special feeling," said the Southport-based player.
'I couldn't defend my Extremadura Open title because it was taken off the competition year after my win.
It's magical to come back to that.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember memories of the last year; for me and my wife, Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always be in our hearts.'
Gary Orr, who joined the European Tour of the Tour earlier this year, will also return to the competition on home soil when he turned 50.
It will be his first event in Scotland since taking part in the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"It's always a bit more meaningful to play," said Orr, a Helensburgh man.
'You want to perform well, but at the same time you'll feel the extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again and shown a pretty decent golf game.
I'm happy with the way things have gone so far.'
The trio will be joined in the squad by former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and serial tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the competition, the other being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entry is free, and parking for a car costs 5 pounds for a car with one passenger and 10 pounds for a car with two or more passengers.
All proceeds will go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's gold-plated land
When Bardina Degei prepares dinner, she doesn't use lead.
He rarely even uses pot.
In a wooden house in Enarotal, the capital of the Indonesian targ Papua province of Paniai, the capital, the homegrown family place a batt directly called nota in the local language.
After half an hour, the charred mug is taken from the light and eagerly stashed with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the muddy floor - she doesn't have furniture, and she does her daily household chops, such as washing with blurry water from nearby swamp.
The role of toilet is filled by a bumper in a room without a roof.
As she is the youngest of her husband's four women, she is not destined to look after any of the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
But late work can be dangerous - most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink heavily, plus there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to go around the village after 5 p.m." he says.
It's a rare glimpse of life in the mountainous country of Papua. It is a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a controversy over the referendum that forced just 1026 elderly people to vote to raise their hands in front of the Occupy troops.
The movement, which has vented the Dutch overdose, quickly turned its rage against the Jakarta government, which continues to keep the region under strong control, deterring foreign journalists and human rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and the West Passover, so independent Papua New Guinea remained in the east of the island.
Enaroali is a similarly distant and deserted place. To get here, you have to fly 90 minutes from the provincial capital, Jayapura, to Nabire and then make the five-hour journey to the nausea of the rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city of about 19,000 has a population of about 19,000 consists of treehouses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered by wavy iron roofs whose rusts have turned different shades of yellow.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, nor have there been almost any foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Mee Pago's papacy worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," Degei says, referring to his colourful hand-painted turban, dark blouse and bright skirt.
'Before that's what we only wore on the body.'
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy are among the worst in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's gold-plated land.
Just 100 km from Pania, a mountainous province of 153,000 in New Jersey, is home to Grasberg, the world's largest and most lucrative gold mine owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can boast consumer timber, which is estimated to be worth USD 78 billion.
But these riches are a source of penguins' suffering, as they lead to the stifling presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study in The New York Times found that Freeport paid about USD 20 million to local military personnel and military units between 1998 and 2004, including up to USD 150,000 for a single officer.
The Papuans' efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden and are ruthlessly revolving around.
Human rights activists say more than 500,000 bats have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings in the 1970s in the mountainous lands belonging to Papuan tribes were a measure of genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the area.
The Brisbane archbishop's 2016 report "We Lovers All" includes testimonials of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (one other report says rape and electric shocking are particularly common) and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because these incidents happen weekly," says Andrew Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Cruises are even more entrenched as Papuans have caused an influx of newborns from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the province's 3.5 million population is Christian, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the crowded islands of Java, Kalimtan, Sumatra and Sulawesi in Indonesia.
Javachi family meals sell crisp chicken and mixed vegetables gado with gado-gado, which is served with peanuts.
The locals cannot compete with them.
"Migphers started selling chicken and vegetables cheaper than local bacon in the traditional market," explains 24-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Pania and moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
"Indigenous tanks - the papaya mama-mama's . . . . they lose their market share as a result," he said.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known to the Jokowi in the crowd as the Jokowi, vowed to address their inequalities and human rights abuses in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former hippie won 27 of the 29 constituencies in Papua, including Pania, on his way to Jakarta's presidential palace.
But very little has changed in Papua and locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes of restoring justice," says You.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi took office, Paniai languished in a slump.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children sang Christmas songs at Enarotal when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle in the darkness.
The children who were instigated told them they should turn on the front lights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers sneaked on their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
Victims and eyewitnesses said the drunken soldiers chased the children and beat them with their gun handles.
One of the soldiers then shot the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so brutally beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby Electoral Commission building was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered at a football field in front of a local police station and military command centre to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial yachts and performed a waiting dance dance in the Papua honey pago trio, during which a bird song was draped and matted.
Some protesters began throwing rocks at police and militants.
As the anger escalated, soldiers were sent commands through internal radio. "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them," the official document said, as seen by TIME magazine but has not been issued to local media outlets.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, a senior in the district of Kego Koto, in the Enarobal town, felt threatened and called for calm to keep the crowds home.
Nobody had the will to listen.
"I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," he told TIME magazine on the veranda of his bright colours on the veranda of a treehouse.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers they had gathered.
"There was a lot of shots, there was a lot of shots," he adds.
A local man, Alfius Youw, was hit three times, according to a cousin who witnessed his shooting.
"I would go to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who uses only one name like many Indonesians, told TIME.
'I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.'
Papuan police inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates only ensured the safety of his station because it was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves if we are threatened with murder," said Detective Superintendent Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for the Papua police in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death," he said.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and there were many injured.
News of the killings only arrived in Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapurra in which he offered his condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the abuse in Papua.
"I want to resolve this case immediately so it doesn't happen again again," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would establish an out-of-court mechanism to tackle crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately, apologies followed.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago," he said.
Some of these took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
"It's that we're committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes," he said.
But speaking to TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, Wiranto has withdrawn his word, saying he has no intention of setting up a mechanism to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "everything will be resolved by law."
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the bloody independence referendum in 1999, said 11 crimes against human rights had already been solved in Papua, including what happened in Pania.
The families of the victims of Paniai accepted such claims with grim distrust.
"I've been interrogated four times in the last three years, but there's been no progress," Yohanes said.
'I'm tired.'
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
'I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot.'
His brother, Yacobus, said the people of Pania were afraid to dispel the incident.
He said he was beaten by the army after helping to bury the four victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army came looking for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the Paniai neighborhood of Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when they went out for a row between villagers and the head of a construction company who refused to transport the unconscious man to the hospital.
This man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's office in a construction site.
Police said villagers threw stones at police officers, after which they responded with warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesia's military police) started shooting at the crowd, killing one person.
"We were in a big panic, we're afraid of revenge," Dominggu Badii, a 29-year-old who lives near a hospital and was seen carrying the injured, told TIME magazine.
'I've been hiding in my house for two days.'
The Deiyai parliament has called for the police officers involved to be held accountable and the police mobile brigade from the area to be retrieved.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of thoughtful development feeds the discontent of the honey, moni, dangling and damadli tribes living in the central mountain in Papua.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL) army of rebels, which they say defends the rights of Baghdadians by carrying out random attacks and kidnapping raids among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the VPL's leaders are from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of people in Perth in recent years under the pretext of "defending the sovereignty of the country."
Some of them will never show up again.
Among Papuans, Pania is known as a "tragic forgotten place."
Poverty feeds discontent.
The little rice that is being sold in Enarotal is too expensive for locals to buy.
The bread is just as elusive.
People grow all their food themselves - mainly bacon, plus a little fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the job of women, each of whom can care for four or five bats.
They usually keep most of the catch to their families; the rest are sold in the local market.
Ten bats cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequalities between indigenous padlocks and new migrants have been growing have been growing since the opening of new routes at Nabire airport has been growing.
The few jobs that exist will go better for well-educated and wealthier migrants.
The Papuans themselves often lack the capital or the necessary skills to do a competitive business.
"Young people aren't interested in staying because there's no job or money here," says John Gobai, president of the Paniai tribal council.
The separation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, strict restrictions remain on foreign media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua because "they did not follow appropriate practices" despite being granted a rare filming licence.
Phelim Kine, deputy head of Asia at Human Rights Watch, said Jokowi's election promises had not been made to lift restrictions on reporters to promote transparency and development.
"Indonesia, journalists trying to report from Papua's most eastern, unruly provinces and Western Palais are facing new threats - the rejection of the visa and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of a media drillinger eyebrow means international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states in Scotland urged Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands to investigate "a number of large-scale crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Pania.
These same countries have historically supported the VPL.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's allegations, telling reporters in Jakarta: "Indonesia still has democratic order and freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to bury evidence of human rights cases."
Locals want more foreign governments to take notice.
When the official Dutch delegation, led by the country's human rights envoy, Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people interrupted their silence, according to a source who was present at the meeting but wished to remain anonymous, urging: "We want freedom."
Indonesia will hold new presidential elections in 2019, but the Baggies do not believe they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Pania," says Hobai, president of the tribal council.
He wants to tell Jokowi that, in addition to the constant threat of a predatory army, they are struggling with nimble education and health services.
Gobai said the people of Pania, like other bakers, see his vote for Jokowi as a debt he has to pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite the excitement and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Pania were able to cope with the latest symbolic revolt - they buried the body of one of the victims on a land opposite the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be put on its feet, at least they will not let those in charge forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus with a broken head.
"What else can we do?" he said.
Fire swallowed Dubai Torchi skyscraper for second time
The fire swept through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee that 337-metre-high and 79-storey building.
It is the second fire to have ravatheised a high-rise building in just two years, called the Torch, or True Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct cause of the fire was reported.
"We slept and woke up to the fire scene and people screaming," he said.
"We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," one resident, who called himself George, told Reuters.
Civil defense officials in Dubai said firefighters extinguished the flames at about 4 a.m. local time (0000 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident could once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outdoor area of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation into the 2015 fire by the Turch board found the facade cover - decorative panels and insulation - suffered the most damage.
British police have said they believe the insulation and facade panels at Grenfell Tower in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire there in June, which killed around 80 people.
Watch: These phones are likely to become sales giants in autumn
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, as phone manufacturers then reveal their new top models.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium went on sale in the spring, with new hit-and-run phones also on storefronts in the autumn.
Kristjan Seema, Tele2's director of marketing and sales, said this year's flagships featured an innovative design, an eye-watering scanner, a 4.K resolution screen and a super-fast processor.
There was a lot of excitement in the tech world of the Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the top of the smartphone sales chart.
Autumn promises smart enthusiasts even lighter fast charging, a more durable battery, a higher-quality camera and a higher water and dust resistance.
He added that the rumours could already make assumptions and predict the top four models, which are expected to hit this year's sales charts.
The top four smartphone models will arrive at stores later this fall.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to hit stores as early as mid-September.
But there are a lot of rumours about what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it.
While the iPhone 7 didn't bring significant differences next to the iPhone 6s, Apple's 10th birthday is expected to be completely different from previous ones.
There are four colours: black, white, pink and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is apparently the screen, which covers the entire front panel of the phone, the home button has been lost and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
JonyIve, Apple's head of design, is calling for the new iPhone model to look like a smooth glass.
There has also been talk of a ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to an eye-watering sponge, wireless charging and even higher quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
It's certainly one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
Pre-orders for the new model, the Galaxy Note 8, starts on August 23.
There have been a lot of rumours about what the new Galaxy Note 8 is going to look like.
More business users are reportedly expected to be targeted, and S Pen will allow even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one with a wide angle and the other a narrower-looking TV object.
No one knows yet what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case this is Samsung's first test, which is certainly comparable to the iPhone 8 in terms of quality.
But we look forward to 23 August.
Although Nokia has put three smartphones on sale this year, the Nokia 6 is still missing its flagship - Nokia 8, which will be on display on August 16.
We're looking forward to a screen from Nokia 5.3-inch edge and a super-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of an aluminium corpus and significant level of water and dust resistance IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia's new model has two rear cameras, the optics of which are manufactured by Zeiss.
While Sony's solid flagship has been XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones will be added in the near future, with even more innovative features.
We expect a smartphone that's a little more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least as good or better with a camera.
There has been speculation about Sony's new model that its screen is at least six-inch.
What the reality will bring, we will be able to see very soon, as traditionally Sony has unveiled its autumn flagship at the IFA, the international technology fair that will take place this year from 1 to 6 September.
Trump pressed Mexico to pay for border wall, according to leaked phone calls
The Washington Post has released transcribing of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders.
On January 27, Trump pressed Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in a phone call to stop publicizing that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The American president lashed out at him for publicly denouncing the wall, saying, "You can't tell the press."
Trump has set up his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore Mexico to pay for the project.
There were also transcribings from his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull revealing the intense debate.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal for the United States to take on refugees heading to Australia was "naive" and "shocked." He argued that the deal, which was made under the Obama administration, would leave him with the impression of "driving" as he has proposed a ban on re-iming refugees into the United States.
Trump ended the speech by telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant speech of the day."
The Supreme Court did not hear the appeal of the MRP City Lines in a case in which the city of Tartu rejected their bid for bus transport from July 2019 to 2029.
It is an order rejecting the tender for the company MRP City Lions in Tartu for the tender, as the tender did not meet the requirements, said Anneli Apuhtin, head of legal services at the city of Tartu.
This is the procurement of a public bus transport in the inner city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
The MRP City Lines appealed to the Supreme Court's ruling.
The Supreme Court did not take a hearing.
While on social media many complain that the noise from the Weekend Festival is disrupting their night out and the whole city is full of intoxicated partygoers, there are many who don't have a bad word to say about the festival on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the partygoers were so polite in the store!
I didn't see any blurredness or rudeness.
Even I saw the kindness," says Ms. Laine.
"It's great to come, have and it's a pleasure to have a peacock that's like winter sleeping in winter," he adds cheerfully.
Wondering the beach doesn't bother Wine's sleep.
While living in the city centre, he still heard music being played on the beach, the music has not yet reached his home.
"But I hope I hear," he says cheerfully.
Speaking to The Associated Press, Agnes says the big festival is more of a good thing for Perth - it contributes greatly to the turnover of local traders.
He also rejoices that so many expats have come to visit the summer capital.
The man doesn't bother the woman.
Although I don't sunbathe on the beach anymore, it's nice that the beach has been living.
And it's great that people are moving and that's been the case three times already," he says.
The first time I think it was a little worse.
"There may have been complaints", he reflects.
But the beach-based melee, he said, is common for summer superstars.
"This Weekend is a very good promo for our little town," says Harry, who is hiding in the park.
Melbourne and mobster haven't hit his life's rhythm either.
But what?!
We should all stick together.
Think about how this interethnic communication would be better.
The music doesn't molest the man.
It doesn't bother, even though I live nearby.
"Good people can save and there's no mischief," he says.
The guests who come to the scene are polite, he said.
'They've exaggerated a little bit, of course, but young people are young and lord god - give it a go, but be human and we can do it!' He says.
By then, the coastal residents would have traveled somewhere, either to relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this kind of merchandise," says Tina, who has been walking with children in Perth.
Her family's sleep isn't bothered by festival music, either, though last year it went even further than this year.
Last summer the stage was the other way, then we heard more.
"We live out of town that it actually gets pretty good along the Highway," he says.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
Pearson, a British education company, said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent, launching another restructuring programme to tackle the business's looming predicament.
The lost jobs, which will be made redundant, will most likely be made in late 2018 and early 2019, will be added to the 4,000 positions lost in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced plans in May to cut costs by another 300 million pounds (394 million U.S. dollars) as part of a third cost reduction program to try to revive a business that has been hit by a rapid shift to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell a stake in the company to its partner company, Bertelsmann, last month of the company's Penguin Random House, said its expectations for the year had not changed since it reported a 1 per cent rise in sales revenue to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Severe weather continues with rain on Sunday
In Estonia, with a thunderstorm of rain on Sunday, warm weather will be warm in the summer, with wind gusts at times.
There will be cloudy weather in Estonia at night.
Several inches of rain fall, there could be thunderstorms.
Winds from the southwest and west will be 5 to 11 mph, with gusts up to 14 mph on the islands and coasts up to 18 mph.
The temperature is 13-17 degrees.
The day will be intermittent cloudy weather.
Slowling rain in many areas, with possible thunderstorms.
Southwest winds of 6-12 mph, gusts up to 15 mph, up to 20 mph on the islands and coasts.

Convoate attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, according to officials.
The NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
Unconfirmed local reports said three civilians were also killed in the incident in the city's Qarabagakh district.
The bombing is the latest in a series of acts of violence that has hit Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 people killed in a Mosque attack in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said Thursday night's explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with "a self-made explosive device" carried by a joint patrol.
The statement said all were injured in stable condition and were being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents say the growing force of the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS), are a serious source of concern for NATO forces in Qarabah.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which around 20% in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul's predominantly Shiite district.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On May 31, a major bomb attack killed more than 150 people in the city center - the most deadly military attack in the country since U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of U.S. troops helping the country's military and police.
Correspondents say the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public crisis of confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA cancels decision to delay smog order after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) overturned a decision to delay the Obama-era regulation requiring states to limit smog-induced emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced the decision to continue with "2015 ozone-defining operations" late Wednesday, saying it showed the agency's commitment to working with the states.
"We believe we need to engage in dialogue with our state partners and listen to," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to push ozone-depletations to measure smog pollution in various parts of the country to determine where its levels should be reduced by one year to October 2018 in response to a stricter air quality standard.
Fifteen mostly Democratic states filed a lawsuit Tuesday with the District of Columbia, saying the decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has tried to pull back a series of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama. Trump said it's part of a broader plan to boost growth.
But those efforts have sparked retaliatory reactions among Democrats and conservation groups concerned about the increased impact on human health.
The EPA's website says inhaling ozone-containing air "may reduce the lungs' ability to function and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases" such as asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
German pigs and cattle could have a feast as heavy rains threaten the catch of the European Union's second-largest wheat producer, Bloomberg writes.
This year, weeks of rainfall before harvesting could mean that the fruit, intended as a bread industry, tends to feed only the animals.
"The quality is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat could go into animal feed, double the normal rate, Agravis predicted.
German farmers, like their European counterparts, have been exposed to all weather this year.
First, winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which was replaced by a heatwave in June.
In July, Germany was hit by rainfall, which has continued in August.
Many eyes have been turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only 5 per cent of wheat has been harvested.
The harvest has not yet started in most of the area, said Ceravis, a local harvest buyer.
"It's quite a tough day," said Frank Deckert of Rendsburg, a senior trader at Ceravis.
In all of the compilation, the clever wedges of Finn's interior design
Beautiful nature plays a part in the interiors of the fair's homes, as the magnificent views of the Saimaa shores reach many (living) rooms through large windows.
Each step stands out the quest for our northern neighbours to create both rough and perfect (energy-efficient) homes.
The ability of Finns to use wood as a construction and finishing material, furniture and beauty is worthy of respect, as well as respect for the woodwork.
Visible techniques and smart solutions can be found in fairhouses as both the builder and the (home) designer.
It turns out that black, white and grey shaded combinations, if they are complemented by wooden tones and toaster plants, can be very moody.
Good ideas can be picked up for another week, as the fair runs until August 13.
Tree and herb pots suggest that this kitchen is often cooked.
The line was drawn for this year's Weekend Festival, with Martin Garrix doing his best to remember the latest performer.
The crowd was truly in turn during Garrix's performance - singing, hugging, dancing selfishly.
When the Garrix finished, they were scattered across the beach from Pärnu to the city as a joint mass.
We'll bring you to the gallery, which has all the images our photographer captured during three days at Weekend.
You are certainly some of them too, look up!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for first time, discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are expected to be on the collision course to face up to 66.7kg in the short-lived boxing match, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN's office in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked to the other end of the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization bronze medallist.
After Garcia's unanimous decision in a unanimous decision over former four-time world champion Adrien Brander in Showtime on Saturday, both fighters will be in the top five.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How are you going, champion?
I wish you luck.'
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriagal at ESPN on Saturday night.
As the pair posed for the photos, Lomachenko's mum, Egis Klimas, said a possible confrontation between the fighters would be a "perfect measure."
"I'm a former brasher," Garcia recalled.
'I went up to 63.5kg for Brar, but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 63.5kg.
I want to move down the lightweight.
And he has to move up the lightweight .61.2kg and then we can fight.
The fans have wanted it.
So let's give them that.'
Lomachenko agreed.
"The Boxing World needs this fight."
The clip raised the question of whether it should be worthwhile to watch it. That's part of his strategy for wanting to let Lomachenko debut in the 61.2k class later this year to make a possible meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30-under) who also has an interest in fighting the winner of the Jorge Linases and Luke Campbell match after their lightweight title race on September 23.
"To watch this fight could be worthwhile because the fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said, later saying he was open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
'We're key players.
No other name can attract as much attention.
Whenever they are ready ... 
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko a "powerful fighter" and could go to see his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko was humbled to praise Garcia, saying he thought the three division champions from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey ... you wanted that knife."
Garcia said the goal was to show hitter strength and then box.
Both said they felt the tension was growing between them.
'It's a fight that's waiting to happen.
No other confrontation generates as much attention and grind.
"I'm more than willing to work for it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been on the bets and Mikey is just that.
It's going to be a good fight.'
Which corners of the world will move to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Protection Agency (PPA) extended and issued a record 13,000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have mostly traveled to Estonia to work, study or family.
For example, when it decided last year to issue a fixed-term residence permit to 6,702 foreigners, the figure was 4,928 last year.
Officials cannot say how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia, but such an analysis will be drawn up by the Home Office.
While nearly 500 Ukrainians a year moved to Estonia 10 years ago, in recent years the figure is starting to reach 2,000.
The number of applicants for residence increased dramatically during the crisis in Ukraine, with 1087 people receiving fixed-term residence permits in 2014, up from 675 a year earlier.
According to the Office for National Statistics, the number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia is the largest increase, with 850 more Ukrainian citizens arriving in Estonia last year than leaving.
"The Ukrainian community has always been great in Estonia, and due to difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought in a country where the community and many families are already ahead of them," said Kristin Rammus, a spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry.
Last year and last year, the number of Ukrainians receiving fixed-term residence permits was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although the most fixed-term residence permits in a decade have been issued for the most recent ones.
While Ukrainians come here for work, Russian citizens come to work for the sake of family migration.
"Given the historic Russian community here, they are more likely to have the greatest family ties to people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, a migration researcher at the National Defense Academy.
"If you look at where Russian citizens who have granted Estonian residence permits have moved to live, then there is East Virginia right after Harjumaa," he added, pointing out that about 40 percent of them have married to a European Union citizen.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens received fixed-term residence permits, also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to renew his residence permit decreased.
"There is a reason that a new residence permit has been requested for permanent residence to settle in Estonia instead of renewing the residence permit," explained Rammus, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, who said that Russian citizens' interest in Estonian residence permits had remained stable for years.
Foreigners who have lived here for at least three years will be able to apply for a new residence permit to settle permanently in Estonia from last year.
It aims to encourage the people who have adapted to stay.
However, a long-term resident's residence permit requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has also probably been reduced because of the new residence permit.
Last year, for example, 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years were granted such a residence permit.
Ukrainians can now change jobs, and the Estonian state will no longer be fingered on whether the pay criteria have been met.
That residence permit became popular - last year, the holders of a grey passport (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36) were still applicants.
In total, 1968 people, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese, received residence permits to settle in Estonia.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In a decade, a surprise year, Nigeria has become a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
While three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, 200 last year.
Nigeria comes to university here to study.
In addition, Estonian higher education institutions are popular with Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen largely thanks to student migration.
"There is also a rule that where the community has come forward, there will be more of a simpler addition," Rammus added.
In 10 years, two people have moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, the same number from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
While around 6,000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit each year, it is about 0.46 percent of the total population.
Even if the citizens of the European Union are included, migration will remain about a percentage," Maasing commented, "in fact, the figures are small.
In total, 14,822 people migrated to Estonia last year, compared with 13,792, according to the Office for National Statistics.
This means that immigration has overtaken a second year of exodus.
Most of the ex-offenders are Estonian citizens, but more are among those who leave.
As a result, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was minus last year with 2,000 people.
Estonians migrate primarily between Finland and Estonia.

I have a girlfriend who has a whole sauna full of the haute couture dresses I created.
Because it's not her fault that she doesn't live in Hollywood and doesn't go on the red carpet every day, she wants to wear these most beautiful dresses and wears it!
You can live your life special!
The fashion designer doesn't acknowledge the gulf between shiny events and the grey day.
It was this reasoning that has led to a rolling plan to move high fashion to rural areas in Estonia, between forests and fields, to people who often cannot reach fashion.
Mammu's collection was presented at the fashion show in Canberra, Riverside and Pearl, where the royal defense, with 45 models, filled the entire street.
It's often pooged, nodded with dignity, but elsewhere there's more emotions - crying bravado, standing up, wanting to thank you for your hands.
A lot of the audience came to see it, but now they're fans of Mammu Couture.
If you exceed people's expectations, they're excited.
And I like the feeling that I'm like on a summer tour with my fashion.
We had a 50-metre red carpet, a whole street full of beautiful dresses, it looked like they weren't coming to an end!
Maria also doesn't recognise the fashionable idea that the creations must be presented by a supermodel; she is happy to bring ordinary women to the stage.
Often I invite my own clients to the stage - they've always come with joy.
It's such a betting experience, you can shine on stage in a wonderful dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my own show, I'm always behind the stage to give things the last slice of things as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerve wouldn't allow me to look down peacefully.
Maria is this kind of fashion designer who doesn't just want to play a representative role, but to be in everything.
I have my own seamstress machine in the studio, I do most of the collection.
I like the whole process where you play with detail, you discover.
I'm never far away from my work and I'm not afraid of work.
It's not about design, it's about stylistics, logistics, organising, organizing - everything has to fit into one temperamental woman's day.
There are still huge numbers of working hours for fanatics.
I can't tell you when my working day will end, for me it's just a day full of joy!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an unstoppable chain of happiness: I'm doing something beautiful, I'm going to do something beautiful and, in turn, compliments.
It's been said many times that my dresses have magic - they make you feel like a princess.
The acclaimed gruesome satin racy that made Maria's talents famous overnight has remained a sign for Mammu Couture to this day.
Martin Wall of U18 boys: The gun of the Premier League tournament now turned against us
It's a shame, the fairytale ran out.
The first thing to see was that we didn't get our desk.
And when there's such a big difference in the table, there's nothing you can do," said Martin Sellers, our only basketball player in the NBA, BC Calev/Cramo's assistant coach, said of the U.S. basketball team's 61-75 fall to the National Basketball Association.
They took 28 balls from the offensive rebound and got so many more attacks because of it.
We weren't prepared for their aggressive defensive or attack either, it created .
Many of the English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn't build a defence.
But defensively, they were able to keep their hands everywhere, we couldn't combine.
It kicked the team off its feet.
Their homework was better done.
According to the Wallabies, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes to take down their opponents' momentum in the bud.
In the last quarter, we had zero errors, but our opponents have already got several quick baskets.
Athleticism and close pressing, which was our weapon in the tournament, turned all against us.
Today, we didn't have the strength against their aggression.
The Wallabies were satisfied with their caretaker captain, Matthias Tass.
In the tournament in general, good words can be said about the whole team, to this day there was a consistent hitter.
It's a shame you've met such an aggressive opponent before.
He has always been confident and played out his way today, but he looked tired - he has borne a pretty heavy burden.
But he made some really nice moves I've seen in the past," the supervisor added.
Horrible numbers: The Yankees scored less than 10 points in three quarters in the NFL. ...
It's not just the junior EM B-division basketball tournament in Tallinn, the umpires started the day before in Dublin.
And Estonia's game against Poland straddled the field of anti-records, however.
Estonia lost 25-65, but still had a 9:49 lead after the third quarter, only to take their feet from the gas pedal in the last 10 minutes and that period went on to tie at 16:16.
In both the first and second quarters, Estonia scored 4, 1-point in the third. ...
The Dodgers hit two pieces in two of the first four innings in two minutes, but went 25 overs of the game, then one triple in and then another 21 shots past. ...
Perhaps in almost half an hour, one of the 47 shots was caught.
In addition, there were 2 points from four free throws.
There was a reasonable number of samples in that time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland had 33 per cent and Estonia 13 per cent (68/9).
Estonia have started with two defeats, with Portugal 83-56 on the opening day.
NATO ships come to Tallinn to replenish supplies
Today, NATO's 1st Standing Mine Combat Team arrived in Tallinn for a planned port visit for the weekend to replenish the ship's supplies and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships are preparing to return to the sea and give crew members a chance for a few days' leave.
After the visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a series of exercises and to be ready for future historic explosives operations.
"The involvement of the Estonians in the NATO unit and the cooperation they carry out in local waters illustrates our integration with allied forces," said Major General Arto Reinmaa, commander of the Operations and Planning Section, commander of the Navy Fleet.
As of 29 June, NATO's 1st permanent mine control group will be led by Latvian Navy Lieutenant Gvido Laudups, who took over the role of group commander from Captain Johan-Elias Seljamaa, an Estonian naval commander, in a ceremony in Riga.
The group's flagship has been designated as the Latvian Navy's support vessel, LVNS Virsaitis, which also operates the group's flagship arm.
This year, the Estonian Navy mine hunter Sakala is also part of the international unit.
As one of the four groups of ships under NATO's naval command, NATO's 1st permanent anti-mine group is a readiness unit among the first emergency responders to be sent by the alliance to various locations around the world within five days.
4. Until August 13, the ancient ruins of the Pirita monastery will once again become a site where the Birgitta Festival, which was run 13 years ago by maestro Eri Klass, will be held.
This year's Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to Risto Joost, the artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonic.
Risto Joost: Listeners include "Traviata" and "Tosca," ballet performances from the fascinating "Bolero" to the fun "Karlsson" and there's no shortage of programming for his production, this time Joseph Haydn's marvellous oratorial "The Times," a performance by the same international creative team, is available.
The Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre performances.
It's bigger than any musical theatre in its usual form.
It's a festival whose fascination takes hold and never quite lets it go again.
Because the experience that the listener gets in this subtle and mysterious environment makes the human souls ring and touches human senses in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival in its first year.
Didn't the shoes of maestro Eric look a bit big?
Of course, but because I had a very personal relationship with Eric, it has helped a lot.
He directed me through my entire student career and also supported me at the beginning of my acting career.
Maybe that's why it's easier for me to continue his work.
Eric has injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team and, of course, it's all spilled over to me.
It was great to join a team that knows exactly how things are going.
It was the great heart of Eric Klass that also gave me the strength to make good progress with the Birgitta Festival in the Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am now and I can do it!
What could excite the audience at this year's festival, what's special about what you're offering?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania, and, surprisingly, the first ballet, written for Astrid Lindgren's narrative, will be presented.
It's "Karlsson flies".
And one of the notoriety nuances of this is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Yuris Karlsons, who himself expressed a desire to write this work.
Apparently, he has lived in Karlsson's crotch since he was a child.
Risto, how do you mess with all of this?
Thankfully, my supportive partner for sure.
This work needs a support system and a lot of love, and thankfully I have a cushion.
And I've noticed that my personal emotions don't depend so much on other people, but I'm going to be on every new day.
And that conscious tone, maintaining positivity and actually smiling at myself in the mirror in the morning greatly increased my happiness percentage.
Especially this week, when the most important Tests are, I've been practising it particularly enthusiastically and it works.
Smiling at yourself activates the brain and lifts the tone.
It's not just a punchline.
I don't think people yet know half the things about their bodies that the universe offers them, but everyone is slowly discovering it.
Immediately, there is an important moment.
Do you have any ritual before you step into the editor's pulpit?
It still is, clothes need to be swapped for more comfortable ones.
It's this little moment for yourself.
But generally yes, I don't have a chance to rest or do a little skateboarding before performing a big one.
In fact, I even like to engage actively with people, even before I step down.
But come all to the Birgitta Festival, here's what's open to a not-too-brilliant friend of opera and ballet!
Watch the moody video with Risto Joost.
New results of Swedish asylum seekers assessment tests published
In Sweden, asylum seekers were tested, assessing their age with a novel approach. The latest results from the test show that more than 80 per cent of the characters were rated older than 18, but not all believe in the accuracy of the results.
Sweden's National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started the tests later this year.
Tests were created to better assess their age during asylum application after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of a number of allegedly underage refugees.
So far, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to the testing, and the Institute of Forensic Medicine has issued a total of 2481 tests between mid-March and July 31.
Eighty percent (2002) were rated 18 or older, and in 25 other cases, the forensic institute estimated that the test "may be 18 years old or older."
In 432 cases, it was concluded that a person was "presumably younger than 18".
Tests are only used if the person's age is in question.
Johan Goransson, who works at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, said the results were consistent compared to those in previous months.
"We don't see much difference from the statistics in previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.
Just because a large proportion of cases were rated older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The institute issued 581 tests in May and said that 442 cases "have indications that the person under investigation is 18 years old or older."
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the results of these 581 tests, it was found that in 243 cases people had directly claimed they would get 18 this year.
This medical age assessment method, which makes X-rays of wisdom teeth and knee joints of MRT, after which they are allowed to be analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticised in some circles.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose tasks include assessing human biological maturity to find out whether they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
'I've had reason to think about it and I don't think the method of measurement we are using at the moment should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can," he told Metro.
But Johan Göransson, of the Institute of Forensic Medicine, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, the risk of a child being inaccurately mated is low.
The biggest risk, or about 10%, is if the person is just under 18."

Anna Maria Orel, a 20-year-old winger, made a fine debut at the London Melbourne Cup, finishing a good 18th in 67.37.
Oregon was the youngest female scout in the MSM and a cheerful woman said she hoped to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and I had a good experience.
"I immediately made my average score in the first Test (64.80), in the second (62.80) I risked too much and in the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear," Orel said after the contest.
I was looking for my throw and I'm very happy to find it.
Anna Maria Orel's MS debut finished in a fine 18th.
The rain didn't bother Orelli because he's training through the winter at TCU Stadium.
"I'm hardened," he said with a small tweet.
There was almost a full house of people at the London Olympic Stadium, did Oregon perceive people around him or how to turn himself off?
I felt, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it adds up - that's it!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel said he would be happy with his NRL debut and was still looking forward to a lot of good competitions: "I came here with the 32nd or last result this season, I finished 18th.
It's a very decent result.
I'm 20 and in MS - that's the only thing that matters.
I'll have a good experience and some days I want to compete for medals.
West Virginia governor announces party change
Democratic Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia announced at a rally with President Trump on Thursday night that he would change the party.
"It wasn't or not, but Democrats walked away from me," Governor Justice said.
'Today I say to you, having prayed and thought a lot...Thank you, the West Virginians, that I can no longer help you as a Democratic governor.'
There were cheers at the gathering.
"That's why I'll be a Republican tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you that it's time to play another game," he said.
Trump had promised a major announcement earlier at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the state's only billionaire, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and the coal business inherited from his father.
It is valued at around USD 1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued an announcement Thursday night that "the Governor's Party transition is another blow to the Democratic Party that would rather prevent the country from getting better again than working for it."
"The top 15 governorships and control over the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent cancellation for a party that is out of the top and cannot find a positive and unifying message," RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
It's perhaps no surprise that where there are a lot of people, there are a lot of injured people.
Urmet, who works in the medical tent at Weekend, told The Associated Press yesterday that they have had to distribute the patches quite a lot.
Virginia and marijuana are basic, out-of-pockets and light falls.
Of course, head, back and leg pain.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with false shoes and so the problems come.
Medics have also had to help visitors with a few major injuries - there have been some panic attacks and one leg fracture.
We have also done seams when a person has broken a hand or finger.
We'll do the smaller bleedings here, we're going to be sent to the hospital.
Watch the video to see if partygoers ask medics for painkillers to treat the bombshell.
Coe praises Russians' 'fair apology' for doping scandal
Athletics international jockey Sebastian Coe praised what he said was a "Russian Thursday's honest apology" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that this is not the time to allow the country back to the sport.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, nicknamed the Russian athletics team, told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the athletics world championship that his country was the right ban and had a strong aim to fight doping.
He apologised to "all athletes who have had gold and silver medals nailed in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to keep the ban on the competition, which was imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think it was a very honest response today, a very honest presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian federation itself acknowledged that they had had quite difficult times and were doing everything possible to restructure the federation," he said.
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia had accepted its reinstatement criteria.
"I think today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the group's proposal that this is not the time for Russia to withdraw," Coe said.
'We'll have to do everything we can over the next few months to normalize the situation.
"We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from a broken system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the IAAF's strict criteria will compete as neutral athletes at the athletics world championships starting in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF task force, said on Monday that Russia would not meet several other criteria for reinstatement.
Following a presentation to the IAAF Council, he told reporters in London that doping control was still inadequate and that the coaches who had banned were still operating freely.
The electric car revolution will significantly change the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only will the electric car revolution fundamentally change everything from fuel to infrastructure, it will also create new winners and losers in the metals market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say that they win from one place and lose in the next, smaller mining companies will not help.
Glencore currently serves coal and oil, but in the modern era of electric cars, cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel will increase.
This year, decisions by the UK, French and Norwegian governments, which will allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades, have raised the stakes in terms of the spread of electric cars.
So Volvo has already announced that they plan to scrap the internal combustion engine, and Tesla is putting a cheaper Model 3 electric car on the market.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that electric cars will be sold for more than cars using oil-produced fuels over two decades.
"In terms of some metals, it changes everything," Simona Gambranini, commodities analyst at Capital Economics, told Bloomberg.
We have already seen a huge impact on metals such as cobalt and lithomatics, which have been growing in demand for years.
Electric cars have about three times as much copper as a conventional car, Glencore said.
More copper is needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates that this will increase copper demand by about 5 per cent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese demand.
Glencore is benefiting from the growing electric car trend from copper prices and being the world's largest cobalt maker, Jefferies Group has predicted.
Other winners of the electric car race include Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals, according to the brokerage firm.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
This year, cobalt has risen 70 per cent on the London Metal Exchange.
Last year's increase was 37 per cent.
Copper has also risen 14 per cent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Shares in Glencore rose 20 per cent in London after surpassing rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
On the losing side are lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine, which need to adapt to a new era.
The main end use of the league is the batteries supplying the flow of petrol and diesel-powered cars.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
"It's a serious risk to lead unless another purpose is found that could overcome a decline in demand," said Michael Widmer, head of metals market analysis at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The impact of the trend is not yet noticeable in the form of a downward trend.
The slide has risen 17 per cent this year, the best metal among the major industrial metals in London.
Investors see problems for the metal only in the distant future.
"I'm not sure it's so bad for lead because cheap oil keeps conventional cars competitive," said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager at metals brokerage company Triland Metals.
If lead demand falls, it will happen slowly.
It could happen in about 10 years.
In the meantime, stricter emissions standards mean that demand for hybrid cars, which depends on advanced lead-based batteries, is expected to be increased by the International Lead and Tincks Research Organisation.
Light metals like aluminium replace steel as a lighter car can travel further with less electricity.
This explains the additional 1.6 million tonnes of minimum minimum demand for 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7 per cent of global production of aluminium.
This trend is likely to intensify, Widmer said.
Aluminium has risen 13 per cent this year as growing demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steel manufacturers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce tiny car hulls.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy of steel to counter the lower minimum.
"High steel should be the answer to this development," said Sylvain Brunet, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.
There is some progress in Europe.
The end of the oil era can also bring suffering to platinum.
Last year, about half of that precious metal was used as a catalyst for diesel cars, metal tracker Johnson Matthey said.
"A lot of raw materials like oil and platinum at the moment may not have much demand in the future," said Bernard Dahdah, a commodities analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change within 15 years.
Platini makers believe there is continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Explore CEO Marc Grynberg said more hybrid cars would continue to be sold in 2025.
The high hope of platinum producers in 10 years is the hydrogen-etone-based cars developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos, which depend on platinum to generate electricity from hydrogen.
So far, however, this technology has not yet justified itself commercially.
"Dise appears to have a clear loser on the road to electric cars," said Exane of BNP Paribas Brunet.
German carmakers suffered a major setback in July after a Stuttgart court banned diesel use in Mercedes-Benz and Porsche's hometown.
How football's financial rules will affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules, which aim to prevent the unbridled spending of European football clubs, do not prevent Neymar's world record transition from Spanish football club to Barcelona's French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences for UEFA, the governing body that dominates the European game and has the power to ban teams from participating in a prestigious Champions League tournament, Paris Saint-Germain still awaits.
UEFA's fair play financial rules (FFP), introduced in 2011, mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that Neymar's move was funded without huge losses.
Barcelona were paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) alone for the Brazilian to buy out of his contract, and Neymar's salary will run into tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to the French club.
PSG will no doubt be able to come up with such money to recruit Neymar and add to their star-studded squad, given that the team is funded by the dominant family of Qatar's energy squad.
Clubs are allowed to spend ample time to recruit players, but they need to balance it with the legal sources of income that will allow them to come out with those in the football business.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA president in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fall into huge debt in search of success would actually be engaged in deceiving and risk ruining if banks or owners had to give up support.
Since 2011, the FFP has focused on monitoring their losses instead of club debts.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used at Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then making big spending to improve the team and create a global brand - will be harder to implement.
During the FFP's current three-year assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can carry out losses of up to 30 million euros.
And despite Platini being shamelessly excluded from the presidential administration in 2015, his successor, Alex Ceferin, his successor, remains committed to preventing excessive spending.
"The AFP is certainly not dead and we will certainly continue to strengthen those rules in the future," Andrea Traverso, who is a FFP supervisor at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid for Neymar's over-buying clause as a single outlay payment, they will be able to split that amount into parts for the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, allowing a transfer fee to be listed for the next five years as a total of 44.4million euros.
In the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG suffered the most heinous penalties along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.
PSG were fined 60 million euros (currently 82 million dollars), which were later reduced to 20 million euros, and the club were ordered to restrict the Champions League team to 21 players instead of the usual 25 in the 2014-15 season.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to overwhelm the financial institutions by blowing up their earnings through companies linked to the club's owners.
The Qatar company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of sponsorship is deemed to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official earnings.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of Qatar Tourism Authority's PSG support was inflated.
It has been said that some of Neymar's PSG service could come from Qatar through payments from the 2022 World Cup organising committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become a World Cup ambassador and argue that UEFA's governing bodies could easily expose such maneuver.
The penalties handed out to PSG in the past mean UEFA will be even more vigilant in any attempt to flout the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not had a proactive discussion with PSG about Neymar's move.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition that they are guaranteed anonymity because they are not allowed to discuss the PSG's situation.
The most recent reports show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in turnover of about 542.4 million euros during the 2015-2016 season.
Data for the past financial year has not yet been released.
PSG are hoping Neymar's arrival will have a positive impact on sponsorship deals, trade deals and shirt sales.
The club expects at least a 30 per cent increase in turnover when the contract is awarded.
The Spanish league, clearly upset of the departure of one of the biggest football stars, sought to prevent Neymar's move by claiming PSG were spoiling FFP.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' with club and country," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, pointing out that PSG is mainly owned by Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club owns the American sports magnate, shares La Liga's view that the club is funded by the state.
"It's a consequence of property rights and it has completely changed the whole football landscape over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
'If a club is owned by the state, anything is possible.
It's very difficult to respect fair game financial rules because the country can have other ways or other interests to represent such a great player.'
Norwegian's low-cost airline has a nice tradition of putting images of those who have pushed the boundaries in their field and been an inspiration to others, writes trip.ee
Along with the expansion of Norwegian's operational geography, the circle of people who deserved a spot on the plane has also expanded.

50 years ago today: a hurricane-sized storm that tore roofs and windows from houses.
The hurricane, dubbed the storm of the century, which ripped through the quake on August 6 and 7 caused major damage, particularly in the West Country, Harris County and Rapporteur.
In the north-west, wind speeds were above 30 mph during those days.
My old man ran from one caravan to another in the garden and covered up with his hands to support them.
Everything was dark and rattled, like the end of the world.
Coverage from houses was already flying on the dashboard, Linda Kurova of the granddaughter Linda Kurova of Haapsalu in an interview with Estonian Nature magazine.
Linda's husband saw the garden he planted collapse.
But what do you support trees with your hands, where do you get this storm?
The sea came down the window, the water was sprayed out of the windows," Ms Linda, who lived on the street in London, said at the time.
It wasn't until the next morning that Linda saw most of the sharks seeing the likes of the trees full of trees and the roof of the railway station and the next morning.
Locals said the trees behind Paralepa were on the ground, some completely tall, some in half.
Everything looked very frustrating, the storm went through beautiful old trees with rug and crackers like war.
West Virginia wasn't particularly hard hit in the August 1967 storm compared to western Estonia, but the damage there was also severe, the Virginia Journal reported in 2007.
Loss Park and Padise Park were swept away from the ground, but our parks were also badly damaged.
In Tallinn, wind speeds were measured at speeds of up to 35 meters per second, or about 130 kilometres per hour.
One tiny pencil tweeted: "Mother, Mother!
The chickens are in the air and will no longer be able to sign up!"" the Virginia Journal wrote.
The sprawling estate building in Queensland was destroyed during the storm so much that it was later demolished.
August tortoises was not met by the structures of the ski jump mountain in Turkey, which was later restored.
The Red Star newspaper wrote on August 12, 1967, that clearing cities and towns and towns were slowly progressing from fallen trees and their branches, and residents could be involved in the clean-up.
The crop fields were also badly affected by the storm, and the newspaper reported that "party organisations must be inspiration and guides for both clean-up and crop harvesting."
Hurricanes can be seen when average wind speeds exceed 32.7 mph.
The record for winds in Estonia remains in Scotland from 2 November 1969, when wind speeds were measured at 48 mph.
The measuring tool was shattered on the island of Vaindloo, so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be a precise record.
The secret of clean beaches: night clean-up and poor beach weather
Cold summer weather also means a smaller harvest on the beaches of Tallinn.
"If there's the weather, people are on the beach, and if they don't, there's no people"," says the beach cleaner.
There are scuffles at Stroom beach in the north London area.
They face melodic competition from a tractor-trailer bred in low turns that plough off the stripes.
In fact, the last one runs through the sand seven centimetres deep, picking out sea litter and grass left behind by people: bottle caps, cigarette butts and more.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
"When it's beautiful weather, people are on the beach, and if they don't, there are no people," says Alexander Usov, head of cleaning at the Haabersti Administration.
It's 6.30pm and there's a bitter clean-up on the beach because the site has to be okay for people at 8am.
Usov is in the post as of 4 p.m.
In addition to Stroom, he is keeping an eye on the beach of Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe and Palm Island Longkar.
The amount of litter has decreased.
Years ago, it was much more.
People can already appreciate what is being done for them," says Usov, who has been clearing the beaches for 15 years.
Before, when something new was put up, it was broken the next day.
Now what's on the beach is being kept.
Pure beach price
One of the biggest works on Estonian beaches is the clearing of sea debris, or adru, dumped on the shore.
For example, it will have to be hauled away 400,000 tonnes during the beach season.
"It's an incredible amount," Usov notes.
Another big category is municipal litter, or all that people leave behind.
The one-and-a-half-mile Stroom beach bar has eight large garbage containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
There's so much rubbish.
However, colder summer weather has meant that there is a fifth less rubbish than otherwise.
The third species is abandoned.
In most cases, they are children's life.
This year, Usov has ploughed into dozens of model cars from inside the sand.
They will be left waiting for the owners on the wooden road leading to the beach.
"Obviously more of them come out, but it's a normal catch" Usov already knows that soon he will find them back in the sand.
The children come to the beach and take the toys to drown them in the sand again.
Debris is scattered
Erika Scholler, a spokeswoman for the Hawaii Department of Management, concedes that tractor screening is disrupting locals.
The noise, which runs from the hours of the night to early morning, disrupts the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
But on the day, that work is impossible.
In one month, the beach has to be sifted twice.
"If we don't, the district will fine us," Scholler says.
But the aim, like Pirita, Long and Pärnu, is to get Stroom beach under the international blue-chip quality label.
"Compared to Europe, there is a lot more work in Estonia to have beaches maintained," Scholler says.
We have more adru and stones and harder to sift through the sand.
But there is less rubbish on our beaches than in the rest of Europe.
After hearing that rubbish is being talked about on the beach, Martin, who lives near Stroom beach, is coerced into a conversation between journalists and pickup workers, highlighting the beach's current bottlenecks.
In the mornings, there's a snobbery picture everywhere.
The problem is with birds and bottle pickers who have pulled their bin bags around," Martin says.
While it's hard to expect people to be able to change their current behaviours, Martin hopes the city government will take action with dumpsters and, for example, put bouquets on them to prevent birds from going there.
Overall, however, Martin is pleased with the development of Strom Beach.
You can see that the city is taking care of it.
With children's squares, illuminated and freshly asphalted roads, it has become more pleasant.
"It used to be that only one road on the rollercoaster could" - Martin notes.
Treasurer's findings in Strom: coins, coins
A 40-year-old Dimitri has come to take advantage of the morning commute with a metal detector.
He doesn't think there's anything precious about today or in the future.
The seaside goddess are not generous enough to do so.
"I've been working on it for a year and I haven't found anything valuable so far," says Dmitry.
As a hobohydrate hunter, Dmitry's treasure bag contains some euro coins, bottled caps as well as dangerous pounds that later throw in the bin.
Usually there are coins.
"There's usually no cuddle, no rings and no other thing like that," says the treasure hunter.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at their current levels as unseasonary growth and a surge in inflation have dampened speculation about a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish as household flat incomes have put interest rates on hold.
Policymakers of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6:2 to keep rates at 0.25%, and fewer members are calling for a rise this month as sluggish economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its 1.6% year in 2018 and warned that pressure on household incomes remained as inflation is still expected to rise near 3% in the autumn.
However, the Bank also signalled that rate hikes will be necessary over the next few years to curb inflation caused by Brexit, and that higher than expected in financial markets may require a higher rate of borrowing costs.
Members also voted in favour of a partial withdrawal of the mammoth package that boosted the economy triggered by Brexit a year ago.
The bank will end its fixed-term funding scheme in February, which will offer banks cheap funding, although it said it was now expected to receive a 15 billion pounds higher bid of 115 billion pounds under the scheme.
In the minutes of the decision on the matter, the bank says: "In the mid-term MPC forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain robust in the near future as the plight of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption."
The fix was repeated that "making a bit of a tightening of monetary policy" was necessary to mitigate inflation, and "somely higher" than expects.
The stock market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any jumps were gradual and limited.
The bank's reduced growth forecasts for this year and next are comparable to forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7% in May.
The forecast for growth of 1.8 per cent in 2018 remained.
After that news, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 U.S. dollars and 0.4% to 1.11.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures dashed growing hopes of rising growth - GDP rose from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
The bank says growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up some momentum at the end of the year.
The Bank's latest inflation report gave little reason for households suffering from rising inflation and miserable pay rises, saying the situation was getting a little worse before the improvement.
It added that monetary policy could not prevent a hitting hitting earnings in the next few years, but a significant return to wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The weak pound is also being boosted by growing demand for British produce, partly compensating consumers for lower spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were down 0.25% last August following a shocking EU referendum that caused the pound to weaken sharply.
The bank estimates it will likely take four years to breathe full life into prices and the economy.
Before the bank's latest decision, there was growing demand for a rate hike as inflation had increased pressure on stratified households; in July, three policymakers called for the rate to be raised to 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, down from 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was expected to rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the over-inflation growth compared to the 2 per cent target was due to a fully weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, head of mortgage broker at Coreco, said: "In the light of the recent fall in rates, the mortgage market looks set to become increasingly competitive again as lenders crave work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock market looks particularly favourable to those whose existing deals are coming to an end as refinancing, often free of charge and at low rates, has become increasingly popular."
NHS to sign up for 10,000 people off controversial HIV drug
Patients have had access to "transformative" HIV-preventive treatment since September after a battle in the High Court over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England said the NHS would now make available to an estimated 10,000 people during the initial three-year clinical trial of pre-existing prophylaxis (PrEP), which is administered before intercourse and has shown a reduction in the risk of infection in high-risk people by around 86%.
The NHS agreed to fund a clinical trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year that the NHS could pay for PrEP, despite claims by the body that the drug should be funded by local authorities instead.
Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, hailed the move, unveiled on Thursday, as a "new major intervention" while the National Aids Foundation (NAT) described it as a "reverse moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Greater Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people. More clinics will be added in October before the programme will be rolled out across England by April 2018.
Pre-existing prophylactic (PrEP) is a hotbed of HIV drugs that are taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there are enough certain drugs in a person's body that prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken daily or no later than two hours before intercourse.
Candidates eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and cannot receive treatment.
Clinicians identify suitable people who are willing to take part in a clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-induated partner does not receive antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a GP there can also register their wish at the local sexual health clinic involved in the programme.
The programme will pay 10 million pounds and NHS England has signed a deal to get the drugs in its hands this week after an international legal process.
The aim of the clinical trial is to assess the true potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who the drug is for and how it is consumed and applied in the big picture.
Mr Stevens said: "This new large-scale intervention should complement and amplify the widespread and increasingly successful fight against HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of struggle with one of humanity's greatest health challenges.'
Deborah Gold, NAT's executive director, said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is correctly targeted at those who need it and are part of the at-risk group, offers the chance of changing the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at high risk of HIV in England have access to a powerful new tool that is individually manageable and does not depend on negotiating with a partner, through this NHS-funded clinical trial.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "Now it is vital to ensure that clinical trials are rolled out quickly across the country and that no person at risk of HIV is excluded.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial drug has been procured, we are on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of contracting HIV.
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The start of the pilot clinical trial for the PrEP is very welcome and well overdue after months of delays and dragging the government's feet.
Evidence shows how much change this drug can bring to HIV prevention and the prevalence of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial brings us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial is introduced across the country as soon as possible to protect people who have exposure to HIV and to bring us one step closer to stopping HIV spreading in society."
Electricity prices rose by 12% in Estonia, while in Latvia and Lithuania fell.
In July, the difference in the next day's stock price between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to EUR 1.94, compared to EUR 7.71 this year, Elering said.
The main reason for the price difference is the failures of the Lithuanian-Swedish Community.
In Estonia, the average stock price of electricity was EUR 34.33 per megawatt-hour last month and the price rose 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by 5 per cent to 36.27 euros per megawatt hour.
In Finland, the price was 34.17 euros, while the price of the electricity exchange Nord Pool was 26.37 euros per megawatt hour.
Prices rose by 12 per cent and seven per cent respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity moved in 75 per cent of last month's hours towards Estonia and 16 per cent of lessons from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine per cent of the following days did not take place between the two countries.
Electricity between Estonia and Latvia was 99 per cent of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 per cent of the hours had total transmission capacity.
On the last trading day of July, the Nasdaq OMX market could see the electricity stock price in August at about 34 euros per megawatt hour and 37 euros per megawatt hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide, which affects electricity production prices, rose last month and the deals came at a price of 5.04 euros to 5.47 euros per tonne.
Living high - a semi-detached house and smart design nipples have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spaceous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate entrepreneur, swapped her large Knightsbridge home for her Earls Court flat in 2014.
It is on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold her apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with my ex-partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger ground," Joanne said.
'I've bought something that would be the equivalent of the price I'd put in.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and had similar high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day.'
Since the first visit, this 93-square-foot apartment has undergone a full renewal.
It was originally a single bedroom and a complex layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half-dozen floors to take advantage of the high ceilings.
'I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
Those were my demands," he said.
He hired Erfan Azad from Notting Hill-based architectural and design studio Duck & Shed to take advantage of 3.8m-high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development site, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two rooms to each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a semi-detached floor where you could stand.
Erfan had to approach it creatively.
"The metal structure is quite complex," he explains.
'We had to reorganise the spaces so they'd be on top of each other without having to bow.
It wasn't just about building a platform, we used steel design to make sure both the upper and lower space heights were right.'
This position allowed Erfan to create two full-alt-h rooms in the room, along with plenty of dramatic elements.
The semi-detached floor opens from the old-fashioned copper-light Retrovius window with views of the glamorous living space beneath.
The mirrored golden furniture, silver detailing and the retro-clearing Serge Mouille lighting accentuate the style of the space.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the inclusion of theatricality, spatiality and abstinence.
At both ends of the short corridor, mirrors have been added to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the back wall with a mirror gives the impression of a window opening up in another room.
At the entrance, the mirror canopy offers a storage space for all Joanne's meals and glassware.
The living room is accompanied by the chance to close the kitchen if it is not used, creating an image of a more glamorous space.
The clad-closed kitchens are nothing new.
But the unique fact in this kitchen is the fact that it's a garage-type pick-up door.
"It was a bit of a design whale," Erfan explains of the door of the MDF sprawled with steelworks.
'It's a counterweight, so it glides very easily if you push it up.'
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra rooms, an extra bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"At the end of the day, the floor area is what you're selling - or what gives the property value," Erfan says.
"The property agent steps into an out-of-date room and makes calculations based on the surface area of the floor," he said.
Here they have been able to increase the floor space, using high-quality materials that add luxuriousness to the space.
"Materjals are what you touch and that help to have an emotional connection with the home," Erfan says.
'You don't fall in love with the electric cable on the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make your heart ring out.'
It shows that a good design and enhanced area help make a fairly ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they may even create a desire not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
The main character, Dane Jensen, is a Chicago skyscraper-based headhunch hunter who competes with a colleague for his professional excellence.
It doesn't matter other than the amount of money you earn, with all ethics being forgotten.
The man sees his wife and three children only in the early morning and late at night.
In the first half of the film, I find myself thinking that this is the business world version of "House of Cards" - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speaking mantle are similar.
But the less the film will continue to have, the less calibre-clearing the role, and the morale-boosting intention of the filmmakers is starting to look more and more.
A life-changing experience will be the protagonist's son's death from cancer.
Now we have to choose between work and family life.
The son, who dreams of an archdiocevade, makes his father think about really important things like faith, kindness, love, not even the twin towers disaster, on their feet in Chicago.
After the third scene in which a son opens his father's eyes, there is a sense that the filmmakers have been guided by the goal of getting the audience to cry, because even the most iconic-hearted viewer can't hold back tears when seeing the suffering of a beloved cancerous boy.
When her son falls into a coma and his situation looks almost hopeless, the father finally understands the immorality of his work and does a good deal for an old man looking for a job.
Now I bet on myself - if the film has a happy ending, I'll reward my perceptiveness with coffee after the film, but I'm wrong, the scene can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there is a suspicion that I will lose coffee - when his wife calls Dane from the hospital and the man rushes toward the corridor in a slow-past glow.
But the son is wonderfully healed, and although his father has just lost his job, it will prove positive, because now it is time to deal with the family.
I can also feel good - I can predict the end of American drama quite well!
In truth, the film is well-designed, all the elements needed for it exist.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and the moral is beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
It probably brings the film in well.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly actually handles it.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the White House's new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news, in the hope it will keep the booth in the water.
Here's a transcript from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the White House's new chief of staff, John F. On his first day at a high-profile official, Kelly came up with a key issue at President Donald Trump's White House, which he planned to solve - getting bad information into the president's hands.
Kelly told officials that the information "should go through him, whether on paper or in meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he was given good information."
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried to do so, too, and they have failed to tattoo Trump's tattoo on his media presence.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he's in the White House, his TV viewing habits haven't gone away.
"While candidate Trump was upset about unfair media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also featured in the editorials that are being influenced," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "a six former campaign staffer say it's key to managing Trump's Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media presence is also a stable boastfulness."
Well, well.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habits have once been "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign staffers know something the rest of us don't know - that Trump's tweets would have been even more sparkling without their interventions.
We'll probably never know about the tweets that Trump didn't post.
When his assistants managed to save him from miscarriage even a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from consistently stirring up controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which is competing with each other, people are trying to promote their own interests without delay, conveying material to Trump that supports their worldviews but may not always be credible.
Politico, which reflects the entire story, wrote in May about advisers' propensity to feed the president with strategically questionable information.
One example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"Today and former Trump subordinates say Trump can respond to negative press, particularly damaging leaks, explode, obsessively identifying their source of origin.
That was the case at the end of February, when someone gave a copy printed to the president to online provocateur Charles C. An article by Johnson-owned website GotNews.com accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the White House's "source of multiple leaks."
It doesn't matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of the molestation, or that he didn't offer any specific evidence or that he has made and withdrawn false accusations in the past.
Trump read the article and began to ask subordinates about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then-Secretary of State Reince Priebus and White House Officer Rob Porter "have tried to establish a system for managing and documenting documents that are reaching Trump."
How did it work?
Kelly is trying to do exactly the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump remains impulsive and his aides are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad to capital are not bitterly obliged to obtain permission to perform.
There are a lot of foreigners kissing in the centre of Tallinn.
Those with whom Fairfax Media spoke admitted to playing in the Old Town without permission from the city government.
We first found three street musicians near the gates of Viru who had taken the same number of dogs with them.
It was clear that the musicians in raspberry and blossom clothing were backpackers who would take one shower away for the marquee.
Despite the outburst, the only woman in the group played a story with an amusing rhythm, while one of the men beside him with three balls scleard and called passers-by.
A third man had been sitting on one of his backpacks next to them and smoked himself in a heartbeat.
Their three dogs didn't allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing crowd.
Bob, who played the chord with Noem and balls, said he was musing in the streets for both fun and money.
The aim of the society was to collect the ticket for a ship travelling to Finland on the evening of the same day.
Asked if they had asked the city for permission to kiss the city in the Old Town, Noemi and Bob shook their heads.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we will never stay in one city for more than a day or two and, for the most part, promises are given for a month or something like that.
"There's no point paying for it," Bob explained.
When we got back to the Virginia gates about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were with the musicians and chasing them away.
The community moved to the intersection of the Viru Centre with backpacks and dogs to try their luck.
Three Polish young men also appeared on the street, one playing violin, the other playing the clan and the third even carrying an electronic piano.
"We're here to provide people with entertainment to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living," explained the trio's pianist Mivosh.
Mivosh said they are aware that there must be permission from the town hall to appear.
"Of course we don't have it," he said jokingly.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there is no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we go elsewhere, but we have to try," he added.
The Bank of Estonia bought bonds for 149 million euros in July as part of the euro area's public asset-buying programme, while the central bank's bond portfolio grew to 4.36 billion euros.
The central bank will not release more details about the purchases.
In response to a question from members of the National Assembly in the past, Hardo Hansson, the governor of the Bank of Estonia, has explained that the asset-purchasing plan for the euro system includes three different purchasing programmes: financial sector bonds (covered bonds), asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank is buying bonds from the market to encourage investors who sell bonds to invest money elsewhere.
As a result of the buy-to-let, lower-risk asset returns are falling, which is driving investors to take greater risks.
As a general rule, as part of a public sector bond-buying programme, each central bank buys its government bonds; no other countries' bonds are bought.
As the Estonian state has not issued the bonds, the Bank of Estonia is making so-called replacement purchases within the volume allocated to them.
Central banks in countries where the offer of bonds that comply with the purchase plan is limited.
The Bank of Estonia generally buys bonds of European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank, according to Hansson.
The Bank of Estonia has been buying bonds as part of the asset purchase programme from March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering's bonds were also acquired, but as of June 2016, the Bank of Estonia will no longer buy the Elering bonds.
On behalf of the central banks of the euro area, the Finnish Central Bank will buy both Elering and Estonian Energy bonds from June.
Migrants ignore ditch and return to 'millionaire district'
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners have once again faced fierce opposition from determined travellers who have ignored a council-covered ditch to win back their field away from their villas.
Migrants have parked their 20 trailers on the field near Solihull Street, dubbed the wealthy "millionaires" district.
They have returned with an army of horses, children and trucks after they were only kicked out in May, without being distracted from a ditch dumped by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a weak spot in the protective area, squeezing their vehicles through an unblocked part of what had been left on footpaths.
Disgruntled residents have been aggrieved by Solihull council, saying the council is "useless" to tackle the problem.
One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after they were ejected from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passersby.
The council must be shamed for acting because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The migrants were there in May, they were driven away and now they are back.
They came last night, probably more today."
He added: "Birmingham council knows how to deal with these things by getting long sniffs to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy that I have to continue paying council tax if the council can't even stop this kind of thing.'
One local resident, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: "It's ridiculous. We have just seen the last of these nomads left, and there is already a new onstage.
This time the number has increased and even a horse has been seen in grassland.'
A spokesman for Solihull Council said: "We are aware that there is an unacceptable campsite in the area near Streetsbrook Road and we are working with Solihull Police. We will take the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
Evidence is being very helpful when as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling on 101.
It helps to create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them.'
The Weekend Festival will be visited by Culture Minister Indrek Saar, among others, who is delighted to have been able to bring real world names to Estonia.
Asked why the Weekend Festival is so important to Estonians, Saar says it should be asked of all those who fully enjoy the three days of the festival.
But he says there have been genuine players in their field.
"Looking at the level of artists that have been brought to Estonia, the absolute top names of this genre of music are brought home - that often doesn't happen in our wore," the culture minister says.
But which artists perform at the festival will Saart speak most of himself?
I consider myself a relatively old man, and for old people like me, it's definitely one of the most experienced artists, Armin van Buuren, who resurfaced last night.
"At some point, all of us have been tweaking our feet," he says.
But he points out a number of other names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian players too: starting with NO-P, and you can read a whole series of them.
In reality, the concentration of well-known names is very high," he says.

Audi upgrades up to 850,000 diesel vehicles amid criticism of carmakers
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it would provide software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes there are "smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities including the BMW's hometown of Munich, which has been considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines.
No company described these actions as a recall.
European carmakers have been eager to promote the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with regulations on carbon emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
It will also increase the cost of equipment for car industry to neutralise emissions from diesel vehicles, making it difficult to keep the price competitive.
While German carmakers are under intense scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of groping powerful carmakers and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's mistakes, which tainted the use of so-called "fraud devices" that allowed the emissions display to comply with regulations while testing the car was tested, but withdrew in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics unit of Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and therefore is not protected from extradition and may go on trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany after authorities accused the audit of installing a system to evade European emissions requirements, extending an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
Audi's involvement in the investigation could be a major blow for Volkswagen - the luxury car maker generates a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
European Union flags will be for Estonian schools for 20,000 euros.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy European Union flags for Estonian schools by 1 September.
In total, the size of 105x158 centimetres will receive 570 educational institutions of the European Union flag.
The flags are designed for display indoors and must be carried out indoor printing techniques with tunnel fixtures indoor, the ERR news website reports.
The flagpole is the text: "The gift to Estonian schools to mention the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union of Estonia.
The estimated cost of the 570 flag is the Department for Education's estimate of 20,000 euros, or one flag will cost 35 euros.
Journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico
Workers at the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, fueled by organized crime, corrupt officials and unstoppable drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own safety.
They are told it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss which look safer: bring children with them to an office that was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a billboard at the top of the room: "enemy", "neutral", "allies".
They ask reporters to provide names in every column - there is no need for evidence, enough impressions and inner feelings.
Drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of being employed by the government or cartels - a whole list of maders who make it dangerous to cover the chaos in Mexico.
There is no respite from violence, and the more bodies accumulated across the country, the more journalists make up - according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, they have been at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto was sworn in in December 2012. 589 journalists are under national protection after attacks and threats have so far killed at least seven journalists in seven states so far this year.
Recent deaths include their editor and inspiration, Riodoce's co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence makes for depth, although his presence can be felt everywhere - there are a large picture of Valdez showing a middle finger hanging along with the letter "Justice" and two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts depicting his smiling glasses or his distinctive panama skating.
The meeting comes less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss common trauma, their nightmares, their insomnia, their paranoia.
Although a separate state attorney's office was set up to deal with journalists' cases in 2010, only two cases have been prosecuted, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most annual drug trafficking and organised crime homicides, which number in the thousands, the killers of journalists rarely go to trial.
Riodoce's editorial continues to report violence in Sinaloa, even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the data and fairness of the assassins, the security meeting will not be of much use, Ibarra said.
"It's very stupid to waste your time at this meeting," he says.
'As long as the cause isn't known, you'll miss everyone.'
Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital, Culiacan, on the morning of May 15.
He managed only a few quarters before two men stopped him in a red Toyota Corolla. He was forced out of the car and shot 12 times. Presumably because of the name of the newspaper, which translates as the "twelfth river."
The armed man drove away in Valdez's car and was involved in a crash nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left behind by a woman and two adult children.
The rumours are spreading freely in Culiacan.
But there is essentially silence on Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival crooks battle to fill a power vacuum.
It doesn't matter that some people, or even several, are shot every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the graveyard is abounded, detached from mausoleums of abounded double drug-killing mausoleums larger than many living homes.
For a moment, let's take note that the peacetime refers to the way only one cartel runs the seaside state of valuable ports and the drug route leading to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce's co-founder and manager, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, feels the enormous guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes the killing was facilitated by two errors.
The first was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a cartel that competes with the rival and war-torn cartel, in February.
This piece may have angered the sons - the suspected gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they arrived at the newspaper kiosks.
Another mistake was that Valdezi was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after a raid took place in another newspaper editorial that covered the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been alive for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would be there forever.
He worked as a veteran reporter for the Noroeste newspaper in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said Sinaloa "was impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem."
The newspaper gained prominence over time with its bold and honest coverage, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish powerful studies without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by the print they could read stories that no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its Latin American coverage.
In the same year, the Valdez Committee for the Protection of Journalists (AKK) won the International Press Freedom Award for its courage in following Mexican drug tussle wherever it leads.
He openly admitted he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said as he accepted the AKK Award.
Last October, he said in an interview with the TV channel Thyviento TV that drug trafficking was a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to embrace the task that comes with the press of journalists - the other way is to play a fool," he said.
I don't want to be asked what I did when faced with so many deaths or why I didn't talk about what was going on.'
Riodoce's collective misses Valdez, a jockey who roared like a madman, a friend who kindly shared embraces and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office to the El Guayabo bar on the way and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if his love of routines was fatal to him.
His death has also made them question themselves how best to do their job and stay alive.
'They don't like to have them, their children, their legal business, their secret landing sites that are used to transport drugs.'
"These things should not have been touched," Bojorquez said.
The result, even at the best of times, is strong self-censorship and self-indulgent.
Confidence in your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
Andres Villarreal, editor of Riodoce, said the problem was that "the smell can be cheating... and that's what happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they do not apply to the toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt public officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed in the room where Riodoce staff met for security training; a few days before it was revealed that sprinklers sold to governments alone had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers searched for relief from the 40-degree heat in the shadow of the tree.
The government appointed them to guard the Riodoce office, a four-story building in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters pondered whether these police officers were among the 50 percent of police officers who the governor himself has branded unreliable.
Several months have passed since reporters have traveled to mountainous rural areas where control is in the hands of de facto drug gangs.
Riodoce's edition this week addressed the main story.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing guru Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were robbed of one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a quarter away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was careful to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows - the restaurant is a place of love for both drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician who is a member of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics for almost the last century.
Several IRP governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases recently.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at the same location, including how Guzman's son, who is nicknamed El Chapo, escaped from a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have been looking for a Fields column to get information about the kidnapping from the best sources.
"We would have already known what happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose sticky bodybuilding has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all channels of communication have been broken down with our sources," he said.
Valdez's office has become a storage space for labels and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and editorial staff have become something they never expected - activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few tags and headed to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body has been found and officials say it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists have become more vocal across the country, screaming the phrase "SOS press" on pavements and buildings as organised protests.
On this day, Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's death, meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
He has since asked that he be diverted from the government's coverage of the action, worried that anger has influenced his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said Mexican journalists were "limited" by organized crime, complicit public officials and indifferent society.
In his latest book, "Shame Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also at the behest of politicians and security forces who are in a medic with organised crime.
Media captionAriculo, 19, awarded more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and government officials last year
"In Mexico, you die because you want to be silenced," Ramirez said.
The murders are clearly bloody.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found along with a letter believed to have been signed by the cartel of Los Zetas: "I am here for my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to his cut-out head.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the El Norte newspaper in Chihuahua, a northern border state, following the killing of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others let go as the El Manana de Nuevo Laredo newspaper did after their leader's murder in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez newspaper publicly spoke to the drug cartel with the headline "What do you want us to do?" on the front page.
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It's a nerve-racking decision.
It's hard to find work in exile and they still have to wade through the streets to avoid the dangers.
And sometimes they are chased, as it is believed to have happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered along with four women in a cottage in a cottage three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay put and continue to work have to dance every day around risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits she was intimidated by the coverage of the drug trade.
"Mexico is on my way to hell and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, when the latest number had already been locked in, Riodoce editors sat on the pavement in front of the office and roasting beer when suddenly everyone's phones started to vibrate.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people had died in a firefight between rival gangs and security forces, according to confirmed reports.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of messages left by cartels found in the area.
From the same edge of the pavement, reporters put the news on a Riodoce website using a mobile phone.
The next day's front office needed a change.
The sirens huddled past - another exchange of fire in the area.
Bojorquez scuffed at police officers on duty to see if they were vigilant.
If they were scared, at least they didn't show it.
Under the massive portrait of the founder of the newspaper, which shows his middle finger across Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff followed his footsteps.
"How could I ever think about closure," Bojorquez said, "when on the day Javier was killed, the intern asked for me to send him to the streets to report?"
Dinosarus used defensive paint to prevent enemies
At first glance, it feels like a shape, albeit rather scary.
Scientists have now unveiled the first findings of an incredible rhino size creature discovered by a Canadian miner, which is so well preserved that experts have described it as a "dinosaur Mona Lisa."
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to establish that the skin covered in its armour was a red-brick brown colour and its past had been somewhat "difficult."
The report, published in the journal Current Biology, described the creature as "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found" and as "one of the best dinosaurs in the world."
The fossil is a new species of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the chalk era, 110 to 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation has struck scientists who describe it as "truly remarkable."
This vegetarian, co-founded by jellyfish, is the best preserved fossil of the type ever found, according to National Geographic magazine.
It was found on March 21, 2011, by Shawn Funk as he mined at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray, North Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that did not resemble the surrounding rock and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, the animal was being exhumed to dig the animal out of a 2,500-pound (1100-kilogram) plot.
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to be made public.
"If you look a little bit, you can almost believe that he's asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is exhibited.
'It's going to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs in scientific history - the dinosaur Mona Lisa.'
While studying his skin, the researchers found that this plant eater, while covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, was likely to pose a significant threat to meat-eating dinosaurs.
This dinosaur with abundant saliva used red and white defensive colours to hide from predators and applied a shade technique called "resistance" and also used by many modern animals.
This, experts said, allowed the dinosaurs to better integrate and avoid enemies, as larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt for him.
This 110-million-year-old nodosaurs family-owned creature first appeared in the news in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Palace Museum.
Scientists have now studied the creature and named it, according to Mark Mitchell, a laboratory lab at the Borealopelta Markmitchelli Museum, who was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours trying to uncover the animal.
Thanks to the amazingly good preservation of the creature, Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the animal's body.
They discovered the counter-extremism - a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, meaning that the onion side of the creature was darker than the bottom.
Although the reunion is common, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealopelta is much larger than the animals with the retinas that live today.
It hints that other dinosaurs, which were actively hunted down the dinosaurs, that the evolution preferred to be a survivor instead of confrontation.
But most modern animals using reunion - such as scarves, sebums or armadills - are much smaller and more vulnerable as crops, suggesting that the nodosaurus really had to struggle to survive.
"The vigorous hunt for a dinosaur covered in large and abundant armour shows how dangerous predatory animals of the chalk age dinosaurs may have been," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the Soviets also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was red brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal to get clues about its life, including the preserved contents of its intestines to find out what the animal ate its last meal.
They believe the dinosaur fell into the river when it died, thus reaching the sea with a flow in front of it, in front of it.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans are likely to extend farther inland than they do now.
"This nodosaurus is truly significant because it is fully covered in preserved saliva skin, yet it has remained three-dimensional, preserving the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
'As a result, the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the chalk era.
You don't have to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it - just to have your eyes shaking, and it feels like she's sleeping.'
Critics" age was a time when huge muscular dinosaurs - the terods - sneaked in on Earth.
Although their all-round Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than the Boreala, some of his formidable predecessors may have hunted down this armored dinosaur.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 metre) long and weighing six tonnes.
The researchers, whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe the Borealopelta was swept into the sea after her death and mutilated in the mud.
The creature was discovered on March 21, 2011, by Shawn Funk as he mined a mine near Fort McMurray, North Alaberta, Canada.
The museum said it is best preserved in the world of armored dinosaur, including leather and swamps, and it is integrated from cousins to hips.
These creatures were, on average, 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two 20-inch-long orangutan penetrated its shoulders.
Scientists believe this salt-covered vegetarian squatted through the current western Canada until a flooded river swept into the ocean.
But the dinosaur's undersea burial site helped preserve its saliva in excellent detail.
The fossilised remains of this particular creature are so well preserved that the mysterious armoured patches along the dinosaur's tops still cover the remains of skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic magazine: "This degree of survival is as rare as a lotto win.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it feels.
Stone-enhanced skin remains still cover the mortuary armoured patches of the animal's colon.
The right front leg leans next to him and five of the sleeves are tied upwards.
I've been able to count the swamps on his fences.'
How did one activist find an answer to the question "Whose streets?"
Brittany Ferrell was in complete shock on August 9, 2014.
Just the day after travelling to New York, it sat down on St. Louis. A St. Louis resident on a bed in a room rented through Airbnb, browsing Facebook on his phone.
He was caught on top of his former schoolmate's post.
It read: "Police have just killed an 18-year-old and he is still wandering the streets."
He was confused as to why no one else had posted this information in his stream, so he shut down Facebook and launched Twitter.
Posts with the tweet @TheePePharoah user had been repeatedly shared on his timeline.
That is. A rapper from the St. Louis area relayed footage of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body, which was lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell said to himself.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He put his phone away, but later saw a tweet again later that reported people gathering on Canfield Drive.
Photographs of police tape and screaming people and a man claiming to be Brown's father and holding a sign reading "Ferguston police just killed my unarmed son!" was shared.
He watched live streaming in which a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a grieving dog.
In another video, another police officer grinned and shouted, "I'll kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he hit himself with the thought: "It's unusual."
""This is not the kind of murder we are used to and what we might call typical."
I felt scared at that point.
I was angry and crying.'
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
After landing at 23, her father went after her six-year-old daughter and decided they would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the central theme in the new documentary "Whose Streets?" ("Whose streets?"), which premieres in cinemas on August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and toughness from the point of view of those who live in this community and who filled the streets demanding answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter - who was wearing a floral dress and a matching crown on her head - drove to Ferguson again, they chatted back at what they had repeatedly talked about earlier this morning - about the experiences and living conditions of black people.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for your rights?" he recalls asking.
'We're travelling to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right.'
"I couldn't take him," Ferrell said later.
'What's happening now is... the culmination of what has happened in the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow in the middle of it.
He needs to learn about activism and organizing, but also know the different layers of the experiences and living conditions of black people and what we need to do to get free and free ourselves.
Even if I manage to raise him so that he doesn't experience blatant racism in person, he's no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I'd do him a disservice if I'd protect him from this world.'
The first stop they made when they arrived in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, a site across the road from a police station that had become a kind of campsite where activists were waiting for news about police officer Darren Wilson, who was never charged.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who made lunches.
They put up bags of groceries and helped distribute them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new type of activism began to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," he said, noting that when he was in Missouri. As a student at the University of Louis, he was president of the Alliance for Minortization of Medicine and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
'I didn't have any organisational experience.
It was all going on.'
Days later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the co-creator of one of the films, during an evening protest.
Folayan said he and filmmaker Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was going on.
The question asked Ferrell: "Are you trying to document what's going on or finding a story that can be exploited?"
This scepticism stemmed from countless cases in which people - often white - come into the community trying to profit from their pain and resilience.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are not being listened to and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already shaken hands with fellow rapper Damon Davis, an artist known for his activism in relation to death row inmates.
His involvement made the project appealing to Ferrell and six other locals who were watched by the film's "Whose Streets?" team for years after Brown's firing.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, we speak for ourselves," Davis said.
"It was important to me how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'm portrayed," he said.
While the aim wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - it was intended to show that the movement wasn't "a redeemer, but a community gathering" - as Folayan put it - he became the film's most open participant.
As a result, "Whose Streets" is documenting? Famously personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying their wives.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he saw the finished line.
"But I realized that doing this job and humanising black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability," he said.
What's more, Ferrell's story refocuses and refocuses the role of a black gay woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who tweeted on social media after the 2012 killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin, have a hashtag #BlackLivesMatter are gay.
"In a consistent role, black gay women have maintained the movement in general," Ferrell said, "this is because we have to constantly fight on multiple fronts.
Black gay women must bear all this burden.'
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women, and many of them are black gay women."
But he argues that "it's not a kind of equal opportunity creation thing" - Ferrell wasn't chosen as the focus of the film because of his identity.
"He was someone who blew the right energy," he said.
'But it's no coincidence that she was right on the front line because there's a lot at stake when she's living in such hubs as a black gay woman.
His energy can be perceived through the screen.'
Meanwhile, news cameras have long since disappeared from Ferguson, but racial links between the community and police remain fragile.
The suspended sentence handed down to Ferrell during a protest for blocking a highway will last another 2.5 years.
He describes the socio-political atmosphere in an area he calls home simply a "threatening threat."
Nevertheless, he still sees the mantra he has eaten into the memory since he took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
7 tips to get over the hangover after a Weekend party
Some of the stubborn male boyfriends find help after a nasty party.
Or they follow the saying "avoid bombshell, stay drunk."
But it's just an inevitable delay and a decent health condition.
What can you do to feel better in the morning after today and tomorrow's Weekend trash - or any other party?
Drink water.
Alcohol down and after, after a big party in the morning ... or possibly even alcohol instead.
As the body loses a lot of fluid when it consumes alcohol, it needs to be recovered somehow.
Minerals are also squeezed out of the body, so it's good to drink mineral water.
As the stomach is often irritated after being naughty, it's particularly good if it's bubble-free or just lightly gassed.
Go for a walk.
It certainly wouldn't be worth going to my grandmother to break down trees - it could be a fatal misjudgment.
But a light walk helps your body to remind you again what it's like to be alive.
Being lying in a tent and sleeping out a bogey is a more time-consuming way of getting healthy.
Give the body the energy back slowly and carefully.
If you're already vomiting from yesterday's overdrive, it's certainly not worth trying to load a large fat pie into your stomach.
Start, for example, with fresh juice, where fruit sugars are quietly boosted by your body.
If you're already suffering from your health around lunchtime, you might try pulp, for example.
And a little later, the back.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic releases your body from the last water.
As has already been said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't contribute to painkillers.
If you take painkillers to prevent a hangover in the evening, your liver will have to deal not only with alcohol, but also paracetamol or ibuprofen and thus loses performance.
That way you ruin your liver even more and in the future you'll be worse.
In addition, the painkiller doesn't last very long in the body anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it with a completely empty stomach - it irritates your already ravaged stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, you get along well with yourself.
It feels like walking, but you don't get an orgasm when you walk.
But avoid too active pace and exuberant postures - during a bombshell, physical exertion should be moderate.
Make a joke.
Slowly chat to friends and co-stars, make simple grudges and smile amicably about yourself and others (beautiful).
The joke and laughter may not drive away the booze, but surely the afterlife will be more fun to endure.
Once in, the bombshell goes over anyway!
Northwestern professor and Oxford University staff are wanted on suspicion of murder
Police say a University of Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee are being searched nationwide after finding the body of a man with fatal stabbing at a luxury apartment in Chicago.
According to court documents in Cook County, arrest warrants were issued Monday without bail for arresting 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren on charges of first-degree murder for their alleged involvement in Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau with death.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeatedly stabbing.
The body was discovered on July 27, according to a warning issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community.
Police officers received a phone call and found the victim, who had multiple gunshot wounds, when he arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment building.
Officials said Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and investigators are treating the stabbing as murder while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as a co-founder of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K, the university's vice president of public affairs. Cubbage said in an emailed statement that Lathem has now been temporarily removed from his job and has been banned from entering the campuses of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal case being investigated by the competent authorities and the University of Northwestern is cooperating with investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior fellow in the Department of Finance at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to assist the US investigative authorities in any way possible."
The statement also said Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to hand himself in.
Anthony Guglielmi, director of the Chicago Police Department's communications department, urges suspects to give themselves to authorities.
"Police have any idea where they are, but we are working more and more intensively to define the exact location," Guglielmi said.
Gugliemi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to look for the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a phone call from the Grand Plaza apartment block administrator, who had just received an "cryptic tip" that something had happened in apartment No 1008.
According to police descriptions, it was a vivid spectacle.
Gugliemi said it was unclear whether the event itself took place on July 27.
He said security cameras confirm Latham and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi added.
The Grand Plaza management sent a letter to residents saying: "Police are currently working to determine the chronology of events and are investigating the background of the incident and are investigating various motives, including the possibility that it was a family dispute."
Self-driving companies to help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce start-up, but the polls were futile.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse still, misleading.
And even when he vowed to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
"This system just wasn't consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs Madison Reed, an e-commerce company that sells hair care products in San Francisco with 75 employees.
So he called for foreign individuals to help.
New types of humane start-ups are emerging to help companies find out what their employees are feeling.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure employee engagement, they allow companies to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and a hot line of complaint, and in some cases allow language carriers to bypass C-level managers and to contact the board directly.
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said he's got a much better picture of what his employees think and feel in the three years he has used Glint.
In addition to flash studies and surveys aimed at specific teams, it provides a heat map for the company, which provides an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing them to identify the reasons.
Companies are beginning to understand that they need to stay up to date with their workplace culture so as not to become the next Uber, which has been embroiled in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing a harassing environment punishing those who dared to speak out.
For start-ups like Glint, the desire to have a review is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global field of governance, regulation and compliance could be worth more than USD 118.7 billion by 2020 according to data from the financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
Convercent, a Denver-based start-up based in Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, noted an increase in interest and activity this year against the backdrop of Uber's suspicious reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized impulse surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and look at heat maps from problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous line of message that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when the CEO is involved, the complaints go directly to the board.
"Public opinion has been anchored by regulatory authorities," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercenti.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, the company could face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, employee departures and lawsuits, even if regulators do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the rules and operations and provide an easy way to communicate with the corporation's headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find a phone number or email address at the corporate headquarters, make a formal complaint and hope it would be taken seriously.
It was often a daunting and inconvenient process, said James Vitrano, general counsel for Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no good way to monitor employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercenti, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices that previously failed to identify and deal with managers who operate offices in other cities or states are more quickly identified and dealt with.
"I can get closer to the Holistic 360-degree experience of the workers," said Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
'And we're protecting our shareholders from litigation with employees.'
Quinlan said the companies began to take ethical behavior, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, after auditing firm Arthur Andersen collapsed amid ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
But it wasn't until "social media got ripe" that the companies realized they couldn't stop their black lingerie being publicly washed up online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies for using their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors who have been supportive of both start-ups.
Convercenti was funded by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February for 10 million dollars, raising the value of the capital it has raised to 47 million dollars.
Glint invested 10 million dollars in November at Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the company's total funding to 60 million dollars.
Such investments come as no surprise, given the link between companies, culture and venture capital.
More research shows that modern workers expect more jobs than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just on the table.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued and that they are devoting their time to a company that has a positive mission.
"When people are happy in a company, they feel they're being listened to and that the work they're doing is satisfying, they're more committed to the company's success," said Nina McQueen, who is vice president of general benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn income when companies in their portfolios do well; companies do well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytics are promising to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they can find support.
Having data on employee involvement is important, according to workplace culture experts.
But these data will be useless if the company's followers don't do anything about them.
In fact, when a company asks its employees for feedback, it can raise expectations that change is ahead.
And if the changes do not happen quickly enough or not, it can cause disappointment and reduce the involvement of employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of Kotter International, a consulting and business management company that has seen companies make a mistake of relying too heavily on data collection.
"Because if things don't end, the staff think, "Do you actually listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?' 
Errett said Madison Reed, who now conducts surveys once a month among staff, has been able to take action on the same day the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from employees frustrated by the speed of decision making and getting feedback from employees who were frustrated by the quality of their communication, he was able to reorganise several teams at the company and provide communication training to address the problems.
But Ruby Tuesdays will collect new data on workers and it is hoped that in the long term it will lead to a long-term commitment of workers in an industry known for its high breadth of labour.
"If you're not committed to transparency, you lose people," Vitrano said.
'And if you lose people, you'll lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses.'
Eurosceptic star is Baltic: incomes are growing fast
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic states are fast approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes, citing the European Central Bank report.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, total annual production per capita has exceeded expectations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
Success is due to low debt, fast-moving institutions and business and free-market friendly policies.
"The Belgian countries, along with Slovakia, are among the few euro area countries where the real GDP per capita has significantly closer to the EU average," the central bank said.
Although the aim is for total global output per capita to the richest Western Europe, in 2015 the total output of the Baltic economies per capita amounted to just two-thirds of the average of 15 countries belonging to the European Union prior to the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led Britons to seek better pay abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic States in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, local residents are not at all enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, just under half of those surveyed thought so of their economies.
NCAA decision to cancel double-header stalls makes Bruins days long
It's nearly 23 when a troupe of UCLA football players stop for a chat on the edge of a new practice field on the team's university campus.
Some of them have dressed their backs to wearing shirts, revealing their backs from their first day of training camp.
For much of the team, these minutes of force offer a midday break.
Players taking part in the summer courses will head back to public housing for final exams after a three-hour session before returning to Wasserman Football Centre for meetings at 6.30am the next morning.
"The next three days will be a real challenge for them," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday's win on Tuesday.
The NCAA's decision to cancel the coaching exercise twice a day to reduce the burden on players has actually made their days longer - at least until the final exams are held on Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three workouts were timed to start at 7:15 p.m. to fit into the players' already busy schedule.
The transition from two training sessions a day means more days with one-on-one training sessions - the start of the Bruins' training camp was lifted almost a week away from last season, and for the first time in Mora's six Westwood seasons, training during the summer courses.
They are scheduled to play 18 games until August 20 before starting their formal preparations for September's opening game against Texas A&M.
Mora said he's in favor of the NCAA rule change, though it adds another item to the players' busy schedules.
"They have a huge load on three or four days and that's a real challenge," Mora said.
'And they're breaking through this ordeal; they're struggling, they're great young.
I think when Saturday comes and we have more time, it's really fun.'
Once the camp has ended, UCLA's workouts will be closed, which is no easy task given the clear view of their squares from a nearby parking lot and an outside Luskin Center, a high-class hotel that has already been hit by footballs that have already bypassed the goal post's surrounding defensive grid.
Since this weekend, the Bruins will occupy the hotel, but Mora admitted there could be problems with free rooms during the season.
"We are taking security measures," Mora said.
'It's a real concern and it's not exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and film a workout from there.
If you have a recording of a workout, you can do a pretty good deal with it.
But we use a security team there and in the 8th parking lot.
We will do our best.
I try not to worry too much about that.
We have a plan in place.'
In retaliation for the Savisaar-Ivanova electoral alliance of the Centre Party, the electoral alliance of Kristiina Ojuland, the expelled from the Reform Party, and Maria Kaljuste, forced out of the ECRE, will be the creation of a seat for the Savisaar-Ivanova electoral alliance, which was created to show seats for the party, and the parties appear to take place in local elections this year.
But the Tigers will be considered in the fall, and the key will be whether there will be enough frustrated voters for all of them.
Who will stay with Savile?
How small has dwindled support for Edgar Savile's support, one can expect events in honour of his electoral alliance.
One member of the National Assembly, some former and current centre-left parties and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union?
And can there be any reason why some of Savile's loyal followers and friends are being sidelined by the fact that the "Suicide List" at the head, led by corruption and suspected corruption offences, is becoming a reality?
A music video for a Russian-language pop song, filmed on the roof of the municipality, involving a senior in the Las Vegas district; and a rudimentary computer game in which the protagonist, Prime Minister Jeremy Ratas, must avoid the sneakers and squirrels in the way - is how the party is trying the votes of 16 and 17-year-old voters allowed at the ballot box for the first time?
We look forward to what other parties have to think about a youthful election campaign.
If Channel 2 or TV3 viewers have a black square instead of an entertainment show from the beginning of August, there are two choices left: accepting that in future, only ETV, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English-language France24 channels will be seen in freelance, or to give up ten in ten to a few TV operators every month.
There are probably those who openly rejoice in the ad-free TV experience at first, but end up paying - albeit reluctantly - for TV shows and ads.
Outstanding music, noisy crowds and rubbish left on the streets are the unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
But if you don't want to be part of the melee, it's worth going home instead of hurting your head at home - and leave the bedroom to festival-goers for a hefty sum.
Washington changes green card rules
Media outlets quote President Donald Trump as saying a new US immigration plan is being planned, changing the rules for the green card.
The plan foresees a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 people per year, stricter rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans, and the president supports them.
The draft law will go to the congressional chambers for debate.
"This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money as it changes the way the U.S. issues green cards to citizens of other countries," he said.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current program.
The new application process will give an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the financial resources to support themselves and skills that will benefit our economy," Trump said, according to US media outlets.
Siberian sediment youngsters are moving to the city, pensioners back to the countryside.
Yevseyev's Anatoli continues the tradition of famous sedimentary gold miners along the former Maana River.
He works as a driver in a gold arc near Kuvai, a tributary of the Maana tributary 140 kilometres from his home.
It's a tough job: two months in a row without rest days for 12 hours of work and then only ten days at home and back again.
In the three years he worked at Artelli, Anatoly has only seen gold once.
"There's a hard time: when you go in, you'll be thoroughly checked to make sure you don't bring vodka, and when you go out that you don't take gold," Anatoly says.
Mare Piho chats to a local Setoo in the village of Haida, who has told him much about his family's memories in Siberia.
The archaic culture that has survived Siberian sediment will also affect home-seeds, because it's just so fabulous, says Piho Mare, who has studied remote sediments in the most detail.
His first research trip to Siberia will mark 30 years this year.
During this time he has been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How many sediments did they migrate to Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to obtain land here?
This is an outstanding issue.
I would argue that 8,000.
I reckoned it with the stories of the Siberian Seto men, who have thought about it themselves.
Exactly to say, as up to 30 people could come in one group at the time, but the passport was given only to the man.
Passion was given only to one, but he had children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look at how great the territory was here!
It was many times bigger than the historic Setomaa.
After all, it needed to be educated, managed in some way.
Settlements came here as peasants, but their lives changed because here they ended up in areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to river (paying barbecues), gold mines, industry.
In New Pietser, for example, many of the sects later went to work in the classified city of Krasnojarsk-45 (then built by the Soviet authorities for a uranium enrichment plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Were sediments making up the majority of the population in the region at the time?
Yes, they lived compactly.
In addition, the tradition of getting married to each other and having a lot of grandchildhood was preserved for a long time.
Seven or eight or eight children in the family were common.
How much different the culture of Siberian sediments differed and differed from that of the Motherland Seto?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought a lot of folklore.
They did their own (people's clothes), but they always made a distinction between what had been brought along and what had been done here.
Climate change had a strong impact on the traditional dress of the sediments, because it's colder here.
Food changed.
For example, the meat was salted in Setomaa, but it was simply frozen here.
Where are the Siberian sediment villages and what life is there? / graphics: Alari Paluots
The communication with the motherland was mentally strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now Setumaa is going to give back there, it's going to affect them.
These girls who have lived in families here have listened to amazing stories.
Piho is referring to the people of the Estonian sediment delegation who arrived in the village of Seto in early July in Haida and lived in their homes for four days - J. P.
What's left here is fabulous.
"It's super easy to come and go away because the city has a great location: at a railway hub and at the crossroads of the road," says Reigo Tam, an opera singer from Tapa.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sporting and cultural places, and pizza can be found on every corner.
Tapa is a top-notch city!
There is a small island along the White River running through the city, where the killers tend to hold a jargon party.
"It doesn't look like this beautiful place from the train window," Reigo says.
Those who aren't afraid of cold water can swim in this river because the river is full of sources.
I've been swimming there, I can do it!
You can have a picnic and just make romance - you can see the flow of the river and think ahead and behind life.
I've been there for walking with my brides.
Operamist Tam has been practising its arias between the three bridges, apart from anything else, "Because this place is on the outskirts of the city, no one may object if I round up their stories."
"There's a wonderful view of Tapa from the mountain, but there's also health trails where you can run, ski in winter and, for example, to play discgolf - the golf course is done, the discs can be borrowed from the sports centre," Reigo says.
The old props go there with their boobs, of course, but I haven't got to play there yet.
You'll probably have to invite my colleague Rasmus Kull to visit Tapa because he's an experienced discgolf player and he has the discs.
Just he's going to lend me!
Reigo and Player Mountain were inseparable from the time of their childhoods as an operatic soloist.
At least during ski lessons.
There's a lot of tears, disappointments left on this mountain and you can get in my sporting life.
Not to mention broken cheeks and skis.
"The whole city is full of construction work at the moment, all of which will become unrecognisable," says Reigo.
But Tapa's old and tired squad building is a very attractive place to play summer shows.
I'm glad that in 2012, the head of the R.A.A.M., Mount Meos, adopted my idea and came to do a summer theater with his theatre.
While this year's theatrical season of "Alexei Karen" has just come to an end, on August 11, there's "Living Survival" at the railway station, when the old whale-wracking house moves around in the 1980s.
"The days of the city of Tapa from 11 to 13 are the days of the city, where there have been open home cafes and a series of cultural events, including a rally," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old city just after a day.
In a tiny yellow house on May 1, the museum has been in the museum since 1994.
"The house is small, but there are a lot of exposnants and there is a huge amount of information" praises Reigo, a site full of the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on the railway and the military.
Reigo muses that when Tapa goes through all the recommended places, his stomach will be empty, but fortunately the small town is full of cafes.
"We have such good meals and when we sit in cafes sometimes gets the feeling that you're abroad," he says.
Educated and young soldiers who come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so when you sit there, you feel like you're in Estonia and in your home town, but there's such an international community together.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
There are a lot of soldiers, yes, we've got a lot of it!
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The broadcaster BTV quoted the Foreign Office as saying that two Bulgarians had been taken into custody in Greece for illegal camping.
Police arrested people who camped illegally in the Sithonia Peninsula on the morning of August 1, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but an investigation is underway.
The Foreign Office told broadcaster BTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing stiff fines for anyone who is caught resting in a place that is not intended to do so.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
The wolves who teach the cubs go to the sheep.
Hiribs farmers will have to give the wolves "learning material" from their herd once again after a year's break - the wolves apparently who have taught the puppies have already broken up a lot of sheep.
So far this year, wolves have broken sheep in Hiiu County three times, with a total of 23 sheep and eight injured, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year, the number was just three, 124 a year earlier.
Also in sync are the Environmental Agency's figures that wolf nests were not born in the Himalayas last year and the Hiiumaa hunting council has found that two wolf nests have been fixed on the island this year.
On Monday night, wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in the municipality of Emma and injured half of 18 surviving sheep.
Early on Wednesday morning, wolves broke a sheep in a pasture in the village of Reheselja and seriously injured another who had to be made an emergency snake.
Rules for the handling of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs has sent a draft amendment to the Medicinesd on modified organisms (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act.
The amendment to the law will eliminate the creation of a separate data for both GM (GM) crop locations and handlers, using a future plant health register.
In addition, the GM crop handler will be subject to the obligation to have a prior agreement with a person working in a prescribed radius of beekeeping.
Although there is currently no cultivation of genetically modified crops in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and non-GM crops.
That's at least until it's decided that Estonia is GMO-free," said Sigmar Suu, head of plant health at the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"It is important to take into account that the measures developed must be purposeful and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burdens that both the private and public sectors will be taken into account," Suu added.
The bill repeals provisions related to GM's database and handling of GM crops and handling data and handling GM crops and regulations in GM farm and start-up requirements for its handling of crops and starting economic activity.
Specific beekeeping will replace the current obligation of the GM farmer to inform beekeepers of the start of GM's farm cultivation with an obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before starting cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to ministries for coordination.
All parties of interest will have the opportunity to see this in the draft information system and, if they wish, to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The proposed changes will primarily affect those involved in the field of plant farming, beekeepers and the Agriculture Authority.
Only one GM crop - maize MON 810 - is allowed to grow in the European Union, including Estonia.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops.
This is due to the fact that there is no maize pest in Estonia, a European stem, to which corn line MON 810 is resistant.
Its varieties of maize have also been bred for southern regions and this corn is not suitable for our climate conditions.
To obtain the above, the Ministry of Rural has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible GM organisms in the seeds of various summer rape, corn and soy varieties grown in Estonia.
Analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and the study concluded that seeds of rape, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that there is no consciously farmed of genetically modified crops in Estonia, and it has also been confirmed that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho says Manchester United recruited as 'genuine' in Nemanja Matic form
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have recruited a "genuine" in the form of Nemanja Matic after making his debut against midfielder Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The player, who has been bought for 40 million pounds from Chelsea, started in Dublin in United's last pre-season game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid in the 2-1 win on Tuesday, impressed in a defensive role while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on the offensive jersey.
But having missed the Blues' pre-season Asian tour, Matilic was badly missed in the match and held on for only 45 minutes. That, according to Mourinho, needs to be improved from the stage before the Premier League season starts.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant mentality - he has a football mindset," Mourinho said.
'We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible.'
Like Matic, other new recruits Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started at the Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho began to quietly put his 11 starting men in place for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed that the club had already done a "great job" by signing three of his four priority selections.
"I'm grateful to the club for being able to execute three of the four," he added.
'I'll be even happier if they can make four out of four, but they've worked hard for me.'
Another sock-infected boyfriend got his foot on August 1 and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird watcher who lives in the Ring, the first deer has been treated to the squad, and this nest is already flying around, has left the nest site and joined a large collection of stays in Mullutu-British Bay.
That's because the Ring doesn't have grain fields, writes The Voice of the Islands.
This Tuesday, relatively late to ring the deer, another deer and it was on the Isle of Man.
Martinson said the installation of transmitters is actually an international project run by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a deaf boy named Mati was supplied with a GSM transmitter in Ring Tyju.
"His doing things are all watchable online: how he went to winter in Spain, toured the German-Potland border for a while, and then came to Saaremaa," Martinson said.
British inventor has to put a microchip in his body to get into a hand-held house and car
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so he could open his front door with just a handgun, get into an office and even run a car.
Steven Northam, 33, has put a tiny chip in between his thumb and name-brand and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anaestheticologist at the Royal Hospital in Hampshire, Winchester, to ensure the installation procedure meets medical standards.
The technology resembles that of a microchip fitted to cats and dogs, and it takes just 30 seconds for the procedure.
Northam's company also replaces the locks of houses and cars to match them with a chip, charging 300 pounds for one lock.
The father of this married one child has now installed technology in his home and in his car, the BMW Z4, which will be activated when his hand is on the steering wheel.
White House exodus cost taxpayers thousands
According to military documents released to TIME, the White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter last month cost taxpayers as much as 24,000 dollars for the Southerner's courtyard for an event that celebrated American production.
The green and white colored Sikorsky VH-3D, dubbed Marine One while the president was on board, was a central attraction of the event showcasing American construction programs at the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials briefed on industry products from all 50 states on their tour.
The helicopter, built in Connecticut, was exhibited along with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a Mississippi-made fork lift.
According to documents from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the drone responsible for the helicopter's operation, the White House warplane's presence with part of the commander, known as FARGO, was just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the southern courtyard for the "uninterestable" event.
"I wanted to be aware of this because it's an unusually high-profile event," the HMX-1 commander said in an email the day before the event to his superior, the Navy's deputy chief of staff in the aviation field.
The message indicated that the helicopter would arrive in the southern courtyard for the event, which starts at 7pm on the morning of July 17, and will remain there until the courtyard is cleared between 6 p.m. and 21 p.m.
Added to the fact that if leaving the White House were to be delayed, a second equestrian would be required to fly back due to the time limits.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event and the squad's security team was near the plane throughout its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to read in the documents, published in TIME magazine, whether or not the second equestrian was needed in the end.
Hatch's law prohibits federal employees from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether the event could violate this provision.
"We questioned whether this was in violation of Hatch's law and we were told they would not be violated," the commander wrote.
"It feels like you have no choice," the senior officer said.
The White House declared the event an "American-made" official event, and Hatch's law would not have covered it.
But even at official events, there are political undertones.
The president supported the efforts of health care reform that was debated in the Senate at the time and praised the efforts to keep the government's regulations in place.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for political lucrative purposes is no new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them for travel.
But the requirement to use them purely for a photo session is unusual.
Trump came under fire in February when the presidential plane rolled in the background at his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is littered with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the president's plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the 'American-made' display, which featured products from all 50 states made by American workers from American materials," said Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman.
HMX-1 crews often perform test flights around and south-west Washington to practice putting down the US president's White House with a centimetre of precision.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 hosted 58 test landings in the White House.
The official said the flight to the event was included in the "American-made" flight crew's training flight that month.
The Saudi helicopters flew another 11 hours that day for "non-president-related support missions."
The White House said no other exhibit at the event was loaded onto taxpayers' wallets.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in organising the display in the southern courtyard of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not keep budget documents for presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact costs of the event.
But according to the hourly rates of the Defense Department's 2017 financial year, the VH-3D compensation rate is USD 24 380 per hour.
The footage listed the length of the flight from its main base from the Naval Quantico Airport in Virginia 30 minutes in both directions.
The White House argues that the actual cost of using the helicopter is well below that amount.
"Crowding the costs of tax payers on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading," Walters said.
"These estimated compensation rates include staffing, care and many other irreversible costs that will be taken into account in annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the Department of Defense's compensation rates do not include staffing costs, but they cover the costs of fuel, maintenance and contracts.
White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter at the event at the time.
"The point is to show things made in America this week," Spicer said.
'And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they're contributing to our national security and that there are supposedly hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to do.
So, of course, it's right to highlight it.'
It's unclear whether or not Trump touched a helicopter while on a tour of the southern courtyard, but he sat behind the wheel of a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky's representatives, joking to media outlets about the company's products in his private fleet of aircraft.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of their products."
Grit Shadeiko - through tears of peace and joy
In Daegu, in Daegu in 2011, the Shadeiko was hit in the last area, an 800m run leg cramp and a squad was taken away from the stadium with a shotgun.
Shortly before that, he had received zero in the long jump in China.
The 2012 Helsinki EM was spoiled by a low-scoring injury, but he was 23rd in his debut in his debut in London.
The misfortune continued, however.
The 2013 Moscow World Championship suffered a hamstring injury in the long jump after the opening day.
Two years later, he finished 15th in the Beijing World Championships and met the Olympic standard, but that was more to cheer for the athlete.
Shadeiko only went through the toughest caucus last year when she failed to score in Amsterdam's long jump at the start.
I'd just like to put together a proper multi-player one time.
One time", tweeted.
Worse still on: a month later his Olympic match in Rio was interrupted by a hamstring injury in the first hurdle.
Time had to be taken down - can we continue with the sevens race at all?
Is the two days' effort still worth all this?
He thought for a long time, but found peace.
I got my head cleaned
It's pretty hard to describe that experience, but I've thought last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Luckily, there was time to heal myself and to clean your head.
"I knew I wasn't putting pills in my bag yet," says Shadeiko of his self-cleaning.
I was able to turn a clean sheet and go forward with a new momentum.
Trainer Anne Mountain said it was very difficult to look at the carer's suffering, but she understood that the athlete had to be clear first and foremost.
He was so mashed by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit said he wouldn't give up and he wants to prove to himself what he's worth," Hill says.
Now there's some peace in him.
He does it for his pleasure.
The competition came back in May, when Shadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6,280 points in the Gotzis multi-player competition.
He improved his personal best in the bullpen (13.89) and ran in the record-breaking hurdles.
Then the multiplayer felt it wasn't a ceiling of ability at all, but that only the initial hunger for the competition had been erased.
Mountain, who has coached him for years, says Zadeiko is a must-lear.
He's a ready-made athlete, it's good to train him.
If something does trouble or is wrong, he says it immediately.
He knows his body and trusts his sense.
That is what we need to do.
I cannot say exactly what we need to do and we will follow it.
Zadeiko has also found a new approach.
"I'm not the one who does the maximum in training," he says, and says the most important thing is getting the right feeling because it also ensures a good result.
Close baby luck makes you happy
Good emotions have also been given to the happiness of their loved ones.
Both his former workaholic partner Maris Mountain and sister Grete recently became parents, and the multi-athlete has received support from new weathermen.

One alcohol whose drinking is tantamount to "training" the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is such a big fan of wine that he believes that wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
It's not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, he said, but rather a "very active" process of tasting wine.
Switching the glass, twisting wine in its mouth, enjoying it and sensing after taste, we put our brains to work to create a taste for wine.
According to Sheppeard, wine molecules don't actually contain flavor, but tastes come from the way the wine stimulates the brain.
He compares how the brain "sees" colours.
"The taste is not wine, the taste creates a wine tastemade," says Sheperd.
Things that still affect the taste of wine are, for example, our age, our sex and even the amount of gut that man produces.
Sheperd, of course, is admonished that wine isn't there to drink full of herself.
"There needs to be more in character," he says.
If you take too big a sledgehammer, the system is overblown.
Excessive wine drinking can do harm to the brain instead of beneficial - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine risk losing their balance and reduced mental capacity.
10% of Estonian ICT sector workers receive less than their peers
Data from human resources search firm Fontes reveals that 10% of employees in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less than their colleagues.
The 10 per cent pay gap is between men and women, writes the website Geenius.
The Fontes ICT sector pay survey involved 59 IT and telecommunications companies.
A total of 8,577 posts were examined.
63% of posts were men.
"Although only three companies said the pay gap was in favour of men and the rest of the company's view of the pay gap, in reality, in reality, men's monthly base wages are 10% higher than that of women and an average of 8% higher than that of women," said Fontes analyst Ilmar North.

UN says Afghan democracy depends on women's role in politics
The head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN aid mission, said hundreds of women are standing for local council elections, three women are running for vice-president and more than 30 percent of recent registered voters are women.
"It is not possible to exaggerate the importance of women's role," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent the people and be plausible only if women participate fully and are involved in the electoral process at all stages.
The elections and presidential elections for the local elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
For its part, the Taliban have threatened a electoral process that coincides with a transitional period in which the role of international military operations will be advising.
This year's elections mark the first time power has been handed over peacefully from a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said the strong role of women in democracy is contributing to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
Of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million women are, according to the Afghan Independent Election Commission.
The joy of sharing makes everything fiercer on the big and small.
There's always too little time, but the treadmill is a good opportunity to combine co-existence, game, closeness and load.
And what a convenient solution - wherever you cruise in the summer, you'll always have live goggles with you and, with your fine voice, remember, "Let's do it now!"
Start with the warm-up - it's a good thing to play a normal cuddle or glide along the beach strip.
The cricket is the bedrock of staying in shape for legs and ashram - who would want to take the shape of a sand duck swept through the waves over the summer?
It's amazing to use children instead of heels!
Firstly, it is safe and comfortable, the weight is slowly growing at the same rate as the strength of the trainer.
The advanced ones can also make hills with quite large children.
The child trains balance, reads replays and feels fun about the ability to walk high and be important.
Larger children, meanwhile, can make their own scoops.
The scope of the movement is determined by touching the ground and putting up your hands.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the mini assistant to hold on to.
The child can read replays and feel like a coach.
The plank is super-live, but a hopelessly boring exercise for a child.
But it's easy to make it fun!
Game-plank: Take a long plana colony to sneak through.
In fact, it's harder than usual, but a lot more fun to do than you can give a friend a hand in the meantime.
You can stay in plan, a tiny turkey, and walk around in that position.
It can make the little child sit on your hips, but this exercise offers fun for all children.

The child descends on his legs so that his body fat is distributed equally front and back.
You can hold hands for security.
Squeeze your feet and straight up.
You can fly, have fun, train balance and be a weight.
The life of a little coach is extra fun when he gets a little kiss every time he gets up.
The extra load is the scoring of your feet in advance.
Check that the back stays in a neutral position.
The children themselves have a lot more fun making abdominal muscles in a pair and a plaid.
Hands and pulses.
Keep your child's safety, knee position, and keep your back in a neutral position.
All children's favourite and great fun!

From Philippines to the wider world, a tour of the heart of fashion fans
The strapless bags are a summer classic that has become a hit product in its own right in recent years, having to hang on to its right-wing talent, and which shoppers have been able to bounce back to the hit, despite its modest origins.
A bag of strapless is probably one of those things that has existed every time in my life and whose ownership hasn't caused much emotion.
It just exists and if it doesn't, there's nothing broken.
But now the shoulder bags are making for a real triumph, and fashion fans have swapped their fine designer bags for the summer months instead for simple strapless bags.
It's not just a beach bag, it's just as popular as a street bag, and bolder women even walk into the office.
At this point, however, it's worth making it clear beforehand whether this summer look for a boss is still sitting, or whether it's worth pushing the wet and laptop to a slightly more formal sumada.
But the diversity has made shoulder bags a true love of summer for women.
For example, when you read foreign fashion blogs, the first thing that stands out is that fashionistas first go on holiday to the local market and buy themselves a few shoulders, which they are loyal to throughout the holiday season, and which comes with the beach, the market and also the bumping of girlfriends into the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy a bigger bunch of bags on the market and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.
It's worth noting, however, that there is so much demand for bags among readers that in the real world women (and men!) would probably go out and their hands to become the lucky owners of a few bags.
In some ways, this madness is understandable, because it's rare for those times when you can buy something that has come into hit status for just a few dozen euros.
True, clever shoppers have also discovered a simple way to make money here, and so thinner luxury brands are also selling strawberries for a few hundred and thousands of euros.
Apparently, for richer customers not to feel like simple mortals, who are prodding around with some cheap bags.
For example, you can buy a shoulder bag costing Dolce & Gabbana for more than a thousand euros.
But for an interpretation of Chanel's shoulder bag, it can be worth around 6,000 euros.
Unlike most fashion giants, however, shoulder bags don't come from some big fashion box, but their story began much further afield.
Indeed, the shoulder bags are said to come from far away to the Philippines, where they have been widely weathered.
The bunch of strapless bags is primarily an ex-boy business there, and you don't see the locals around them very often.
The strawberry technique is said to date back to the 14th century and is quite sarane with normal basketball.
However, because the shoulder bag doesn't have to be bleeding as strongly as the basket, they can be sprinkled with patterns and other materials that make the bag more personal and, by extension, more accommodating.
Recently, for example, there have been particularly trendy bags with coloured pillows or leather strips.
But the thank-you-blind shoulder bags can be sent to actress Jane Birkin, the biggest red-haired shoulder fan, had never been seen before.
She matched her shoulder bag to all sorts of clothing and didn't even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
However, the popularity of crickets these days does not play a smaller role, however, that they are a head of fellas and, unlike all sorts of mushrooms, do not have to be cared for by special means, but also by water and a wet towel.
As with trendy gigs, brands have come up with all sorts of interpretations apart from the classic look.
For example, you can buy a strapless striped from your shoulders or a tiny shoulder bag.
It's worth remembering, however, that a classic shoulder bag never goes out of fashion, but it does.
But what is the classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, a bag of strawberry redness that resembles a basket in its style has been considered classic, and is short, as well as straws, has been considered classic.

GMB concerned about investment in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union is awaiting assurances from cookie maker McVitie executives about long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company had remained silent about the future of the Tollcross site.
More than 500 people work in the factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products.
Pladis, owner of McVitie, said they had invested more than 5 million pounds in the past few years.
More workers were hired and union chairmen "are the first to hear" if something changes in the factory.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland called on the company's McVitie to "disintegrate concerns that the funding will not be used to modernise production lines."
Drew Duffy, senior GMB editor, said: "The fact that we are not getting clarity from the site's chief executive on Tollcross's business needs and future investment plan is deeply worrying our members.
Several generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is largely made up of people from the local community and around Glasgow, a vital pillar of decent employment in an area with high levels of unemployment and social deprivation.
So in the light of the East of Glasgow, a company with a strong rise in productivity, McVitie's, is in dire need of a strong rise in productivity in the face of jobs, payroll and a chronic decline in Brexit, living costs."
A Place spokesman said: "The site manager only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly to it as we value active communication with workers and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, there was a regular meeting between staff and GMB representatives in Tollcross, where a number of issues were openly discussed.
We then discussed with employees that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on a rolling basis - and this applies to all our companies and sites - to ensure their competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds at the Tollcross site, most of which have gone to production lines and improvements to operations.
We fully understand Tollcross's legacy as a manufacturing site and if there were any changes to the site's operations, the workers and the trade union representatives will be the first to hear from it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona against approaching Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up in their quest to lure Neymar into their ranks, making an 189million pound bid to buy him. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record-breaking of possession?
This abhorrent approach has opened the summer transfer window and the Ligue 1 club are poised to break the current world record of more than double the current world record set with Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.
Once the transition is complete, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and also the most highly paid professional athlete in the world, after taxes from PSG, will receive more than 500,000 pounds a week after taxes.
Barcelona are known to be angry both for the way they approached and Neymar's break free, although a source close to the Catalans' board insists the club have always looked after the best for the footballer since arriving from Santos in 2013.
But did the president of PSG warn the football world of such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing a contract with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned harshly of any club thinking about recruiting some of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they're going to touch down any of our players, we'll come up against them and contact those players," Al-Khelaifi said.
'We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign a contract with some of our players, they will have to face the consequences.'
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear they will not let the Italian leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could backfire as a result of that interest, losing one of their most expensive assets in Neymar's form.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders, after Brexit.
"Brexit is in serious danger of weddling a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland since taking office in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made it possible the current free movement of people and goods, Varadkar said.
"This is our vision for the future: building bridges, not borders," he stressed.
Varadkar said he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and, if it fails, would remain part of Europe's single market.
It would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain's departure smoother would be the creation of a customs union for the European Union and the United Kingdom, the Irish Prime Minister has explained.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "Certainly we could have this with Britain."
The alternative to this would be to return to customs points that would herald historical division and political failure.
"Thank you for trade, prosperity and peace," the Irish prime minister said.
He called Brexit a "problem for our generation" and warned that the result could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's daily life.
The Irish First Minister met leaders of Northern Ireland's main parties during a visit to Belfast.
In his first half-pimping triathlon, Mount Avandi: The Ironman can pass by anyone.
Today, the largest triathlon festival in the winter capital, Otepää, was held in the winter capital, when around a thousand triathletes from more than thirty countries took part in the semi-fit Ironman competition.
The 70.3 mile distance consisted of 1.9km of swimming, 90km of cycling and 21.1km of cycling.
Others triumphantly ended the first triathlon of his life, Mount Avandi.
"I thought it would be difficult and it was difficult in the end," said Avandi at the finish line.
Despite the complexity, Avandi said the triathlon is actually affordable for almost all.
"Not a distance kills, but the pace kills," he said, alluding that almost everyone will reach the finish line at a robust pace.
With the exception of Ott Sepp: "It's all right with the physique, but unfortunately he can't swim"
The actress had been busy since February.
First 4-5 hours a week, but later 10 hours a week.
At 05:34:12, he ranked 270th in the overall standings.
Although Avandi lost both Raio Lowry (time 04:59:53) and Jeremy Lang (time 05:06:37), he won over other contestants in the so-called "prominent class."
Tanel Padar, who was a "fit" for last year's "fast example," lost to Avandi in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tam in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18 respectively).
German Johannes Moldan was crowned the overall winner of the men's event in the Ironman series in 3:58:27, with the Estonians bested Ivo Big in 04:14:09.
Dane Helle Frederiksen triumphed in 04:24:01, while Maria Lane, who lost to Frederiksen in almost half an hour and won at 04:58:58:58.
Opener passed the 1.9km swimming session in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water at 410th.
