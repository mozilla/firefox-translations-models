Four members of the Kemerovo group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to Postimehe, the police in Spain arrested Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the Estonian underworld, who is known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovski.
Gulevič, detained in Spain, was arrested with the permission of the court.
Yesterday, the court also took three suspects arrested in Estonia into custody.
According to the suspicion, they are members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal association aged 27-57, who mainly commit drug crimes.
The alleged leader of a criminal organization was arrested in Mijas, Malaga province, Spain.
In Estonia, three men were arrested as suspects, one of them is, according to the collected data, the leading figure of a criminal organization, and two are members of a criminal organization.
The collected data suggest that tasks and roles were clearly divided in the criminal association.
The purpose of the activities of the criminal association was to commit drug crimes and thereby earn criminal income&quot;, commented the head of the pre-trial proceedings of the criminal case, state prosecutor Vahur Verte.
&quot;We do not rule out that the circle of suspects in this criminal case will increase&quot;, the prosecutor added.
These are people who have previously come into the interest of law enforcement agencies, and some of them have served sentences for drug crimes.
Verte emphasized that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation.
&quot;International cooperation has become normal for us, and this week&#39;s operation shows the success of cooperation&quot;, commented Prosecutor Verte.
The head of the Central Criminal Police Service, Ago Leis, said that the arrests were preceded by a preliminary investigation lasting nearly one and a half years.
&quot;In the first half of the week, the long-term work came to fruition and we arrested suspects in crimes in Estonia and Spain at the same time&quot;, he said.
Leis added that officers from the Central Criminal Police assisted in the arrest in Spain.
We have had good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and civil guard for years.
These arrests are another message to criminals that we will catch them from the other side of Europe as well&quot;, said Leis.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that the suspected men may continue to commit new crimes while at large, which is why the prosecutor&#39;s office requested and the court approved their arrest.
A man arrested in Spain awaits his extradition to Estonia.
Real estate, vehicles and cash have been seized as part of this criminal case to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings of a criminal case are conducted by the Organized Crime Bureau of the Central Criminal Police and managed by the State Prosecutor&#39;s Office.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of extortion and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after the then underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevič, a native of Kemerovo, rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s, when he started dealing in extortion in Tallinn.
It is said that he taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at various hotels and demanded a monthly roof tax from businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscations of criminal proceeds and effective judgments confirm that the fight against organized crime is effective.
For example, the latest judgments, the eight defendants separated from the criminal case of the so-called Dikaev criminal association, from whom 80,000 euros of criminal proceeds were confiscated, or the judgment against nine persons that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal association in 2006, which was aimed at the illegal trade of cigarettes and the commission of crimes related to human trafficking in the Eastern Virumaa and South Estonia.
The amount of confiscated criminal proceeds there is nearly 71,500 euros.
Success in these criminal cases has been ensured by the fact that police officers exchange information with foreign colleagues every day, and prosecutors exchange evidence, and if necessary, actions are taken together in any country of the European Union.
Civil rights group warns against travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people traveling to Missouri about the state&#39;s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group&#39;s statement read: &quot;The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, in effect until August 28, 2017, urges all African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to exercise extra caution and extreme caution when traveling throughout the state, given the spate of suspicious racially motivated incidents that has recently taken place across the state and is also highlighted here.&quot;
The NAACP said the group&#39;s travel warning was prompted by a recent Missouri law that makes it harder to win discrimination lawsuits and the fact that minorities are disproportionately targeted by law enforcement in the state.
&quot;People&#39;s civil rights are being violated.
They&#39;re pulled over to the side of the road because of the color of their skin, they&#39;re beaten or killed,&quot; Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri branch of the NAACP, told The Kansas City Star.
&quot;We&#39;ve never had so many complaints before.&quot;
This is the first such warning the organization has issued for a US state.
The group cited events such as racist insults directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while driving through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note cites a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General showing that black drivers are 75% more likely to have their cars pulled over than white drivers in the state.
&quot;The notice is for people to be aware and to warn their families, friends and co-workers about what could happen in Missouri,&quot; Chapel said.
&quot;People need to be prepared, whether that means bringing bail money or letting relatives know they&#39;re going through the state.&quot;
According to the most recent data from the FBI&#39;s Hate Crimes Reporting Program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, which ranks the state 16th nationally for similar offenses.
The travel warning also comes in response to a new law in Missouri that makes it harder to sue a company for discrimination in the search for housing or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws requiring local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations that the ACLU said increased racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently interest groups have begun to use the measure as a backlash against certain laws and trends within the United States.
Hepatitis: What should everyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, can be caused by five different hepatitis viruses - A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of liver tissue.
Chronic hepatitis B and C, however, have a malignant course, which can further develop into liver cirrhosis, i.e. liver wrinkling and liver cancer.
Kuulo Kutsar, epidemiology advisor of the Health Board, says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, grayish stool, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The popular name of liver inflammation, jaundice, also comes from the last symptom.
Hepatitis can be asymptomatic in children.
It is possible to determine different types of liver inflammation only on the basis of laboratory test data.
Acute hepatitis can turn into chronic hepatitis and go on for decades without symptoms, which means that a person may not know anything about their dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Kuulo Kutsar points out different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in more detail.
Hepatitis A viruses are spread from a sick person and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, through sex, from the feces of an infected person to and from hands to food, surfaces, objects, mouth, and drug use.
The danger or risk group of hepatitis A infection includes family members and caregivers of the sick person, people with chronic liver diseases, people who have sex with an infected person, men who have sex with men, drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented by vaccination, vaccination is especially recommended for people who travel a lot and are in the hepatitis A risk group.
In addition, daily compliance with hygiene requirements is important: wash or disinfect hands, wash all fruits and vegetables before eating them.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread by contact with the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, piercing, using blood-contaminated household items (toothbrushes, shaving tools), donor blood, sex with a person suspected of hepatitis, and from a mother with hepatitis to a fetus/newborn.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injecting drug users, sex partners of an infected person, men who have sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, healthcare workers, rescue workers and police officers who come into contact with blood and other body fluids, and travelers visiting countries with a high incidence of hepatitis B.
It is possible to vaccinate people to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people belonging to the risk group, as well as people suffering from chronic liver diseases, people with HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and people with diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B are: avoiding the use of unfamiliar hygiene and manicure tools, other sharp tools and syringes and needles, tattooing and piercing, and the use of a condom during sex with a risk of infection or avoiding risky sexual behavior.
Hepatitis B vaccination is part of the national immunization program in Estonia and is free for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread by contact with the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, piercing, using household items contaminated with blood, donor blood, sex with a person suspected of hepatitis, and from a mother with hepatitis to a fetus/newborn.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug users, sex partners of an infected person, men who have sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, healthcare workers, rescue workers and police officers who come into contact with blood and other body fluids, people with HIV infection, and visitors to countries with a high incidence of hepatitis C. passengers.
Hepatitis C prevention measures include: refraining from the use of unfamiliar hygiene and manicure products, other sharp tools and syringes, needles, tattooing and piercing, and the use of a condom during sex with a risk of infection.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which multiplies in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection occurs together with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread through contact with blood and other body fluids, contaminated syringes and needles, sexual contact, and rarely from an infected mother to the fetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects a person from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses are spread through the fecal-oral route through drinking water and food, including eating undercooked meat, fish, and shellfish, donor blood, shared syringes, and from an infected mother to a fetus.
Travelers can become infected with hepatitis E in countries with a high incidence of hepatitis E.
Hepatitis E prevention measures include compliance with hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Wash fruits and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating undercooked meat, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and refrain from using drugs.
Although the competitors tried to push the four-time Olympic champion off the track in the last lap, the 34-year-old Farah found strength at the end and won with a time of 26:49.51.
Farah did not think long, dragging his wife Tania and children with him to the track after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
Being on the track with them was wonderful,&quot; Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for a golden double in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters at the fifth title race in a row in London.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O&#39;Connor&#39;s &quot;The Lady in Gold. The Extraordinary Story of Gustav Klimt&#39;s Masterpiece, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer&quot; delves much deeper into the cultural life of late 19th and early 20th century Vienna than the story of the birth of a work of art.
But even more thoroughly into history.
The awe-inspiring amount of information would have been wasted, perhaps a harder pruning axe, a narrower topic would have allowed the extraordinary story of the portrait promised in the title to gain more influence.
Currently, it is as if there are two books between the same covers: the story of Gustav Klimt and Adele Bloch-Bauer depicted in his painting &quot;Lady in Gold&quot; and a much larger and more comprehensive history book about respectable Jewish families and the German occupation with its consequences in Austria.
The first third of the book takes you in the middle of the bubbling cultural life of Vienna, and anyone who has been to the Austrian capital can easily imagine how life was around the Ringstrasse more than a hundred years ago, or how everyone in the Central cafe turned their heads when Klimt walked in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe&#39;s richest cities, and seeing a familiar name in a book makes you feel a little more cultured.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud worked in a city where incurable syphilis was rampant and had the highest suicide rate in Europe seems to add nothing to the development of the story.
Or maybe still - every brushstroke in a couple of sentences adds color to the cultural life in Vienna at the beginning of the 20th century.
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost every tenth resident of Vienna was Jewish.
Adele&#39;s parents were also newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married the Czech sugar tycoon Ferdinand Bloch twice before her and posed for Klimt for his famous paintings, her father&#39;s bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adele was not attracted by all the glamorous life she belonged to.
If you look at &quot;The Lady in Gold&quot;, it is hard to believe that towards the end of her life this magnificent lady was infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to commission a portrait of his wife from Klimt, the latter was the hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimt&#39;s order cost 4,000 kroons at that time, a quarter of the price of a well-located country house.
The sugar tycoon was not deterred by the suspicion of the master&#39;s affair with the model in some of the portraits.
As for Adele, the only certain fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist, formed during the work, continued until the end of her life.
Anne-Marie O&#39;Connor - &quot;The Lady in Gold.&quot;
The Extraordinary Story of Gustav Klimt&#39;s Masterpiece, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer&quot;, Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Just before starting work with Adele, Klimt had visited the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, and researchers believe that it was the brilliant mosaics of Empress Theodora that he saw there that gave the artist the idea to make a golden portrait of Adele as a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his &quot;Lady in Gold&quot; in Vienna in 1908 and around the same time (1907-1908) another golden painting &quot;The Kiss&quot; was born.
Art historians did not miss the similarity between the two women.
How is Hitler involved in the story?
&quot;I think that in memory of my friend Klimt, I owe him to make his handiwork available to the public,&quot; Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote to the director of the Belvedere Museum a few years after the artist&#39;s death (Klimt died in February 1918) and wanted their family&#39;s Klimt collection to go to the museum .
Six years before his death, Klimt had completed another portrait of Adele.
Also in her will (Adele died in February 1925), she asked that her husband leave her two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscape paintings to the Austrian Gallery.
He bequeathed his jewelry to his nieces Maria and Luise.
A year after Klimt finished the &quot;Austrian Mona Lisa&quot;, 17-year-old Adolf Hitler tried to enter the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, but failed the drawing exam.
Although Hitler&#39;s later anti-Semitism is sometimes attributed to his rejection of Jewish professors at the academy, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery referred to in Maria&#39;s will had changed considerably by 1939 - it had become important to find works of interest to the Nazi Party from Vienna&#39;s rich Jewish art collections.
Some works in Adele&#39;s home also fit into Hitler&#39;s personal art collection, but not Klimt&#39;s.
Sixty years after the Nazi art heist, a ten-year legal battle between the Austrian government and the heirs of the Bloch-Bauers began.
At this point, it should only be noted that while &quot;The Kiss&quot; can be seen at the Belvedere Palace in Vienna, &quot;The Lady in Gold&quot; depicting Adele Bloch-Bauer must be seen at the Neue Galerie in New York.
And read the aforementioned book before going to Vienna.
Even if you don&#39;t plan on going to see Klimt&#39;s work, because at least my emotions after closing the book revolved more around Nazis and Jews than the $135 million painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So not so much a portrait, but rather a story of the family&#39;s fate - and a very touching story.
The family tree of the Bauers mentioned at the beginning of the book noticeably facilitated orientation in the events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In the preliminaries, Gold was very close to his own 200m backstroke personal record with a time of 2.16.62.
The top mark comes from a week ago, when the 17-year-old girl clocked 2:16.58 at the Canadian Junior Championships, reports Priit Aaviku&#39;s Swimming Blog.
Gold made it to the A-final last, i.e. tenth.
In the final, he completed the distance in 2:15.76 and achieved a good seventh place with a powerful new top mark.
Alina Kendzior&#39;s Estonian record (2.15.13) was just over half a second away from Gold.
Gold rose to third place in Estonia&#39;s all-time ranking, and his new personal best is Estonia&#39;s fifth all-time result.
The young hope for the future is still competing in the 100m, 200m and 400m freestyle and 200m and 400m medley at the Canadian adult championships.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championships were held in Toronto, and Gold made successful starts there as well.
He won the silver medal in the 200 m freestyle with a time of 2.03.22.
The last time an Estonian swam this distance so fast was in 2008.
Only the Estonian record holder Elina Partõka has swum this distance in Estonia faster than Gold.
The Estonian woman living in Canada also won a bronze medal in the 100 m freestyle with an excellent personal record and a new Estonian season&#39;s top mark of 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, who is a year older than him, has swum this distance only one hundredth of a second faster.
He also reached his personal best in the 100 m backstroke with a time of 1.03.69 in the opening heat of the relay.
In the half-longer distance, he only took seventh place when he swam 2.17.31 in the final.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season ranking at four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpen their teeth
It&#39;s holiday time - and that means relaxation for US President Donald Trump as well.
However, since Trump has been one of the most vacation-taking presidents to date, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president plans to spend a 17-day vacation at the eponymous golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the president&#39;s vacation began yesterday, Trump&#39;s opponents have been speaking out about the vacation for a week.
They accuse Trump of resting too often.
Namely, it is customary for the president to spend weekends at his villas in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president during his 196 days in office.
For example, George W. Bush managed to be on vacation for 67 days during this time, while Barack Obama took half as much as Trump, only 21 days.
However, Trump tends to forget things quickly.
Days after becoming president, Trump said on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; that there will be no time for long vacations during his tenure because there is so much that needs to be done.
He also expressed displeasure with Barack Obama&#39;s vacation three years ago.
The current president wrote on Twitter at the time: &quot;While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, going to parties and jazz concerts, ISIS is beheading journalists.&quot;
According to White House officials, a 17-day visit to the golf club is not exactly relaxation.
It&#39;s officially called a working vacation instead, during which Trump has no time for reading or other leisure activities.
In addition, there had to be another reason for the vacation.
Namely, the air conditioning system in the West Wing of the White House is being replaced, and therefore all the staff had to leave there.
The Oval Office and other offices of the president are also located in the west wing.
&quot;I don&#39;t think any of you want to be in the West Wing in August when it&#39;s 38 degrees and there&#39;s no air conditioning,&quot; said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters, who emphasized that the president would continue to work during the vacation.
You can get an idea of where President Trump will spend the next 17 days in the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook - Don&#39;t run for public office if you can&#39;t stand criticism from voters
The father of our country knew a lot about adverse media coverage.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn&#39;t take long for newspapers to vilify him for everything from his domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism naturally irritated him.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said that &quot;freedom of speech may be taken from us, and dumb and silent we may be led like sheep to the slaughter.&quot;
Which brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who is struggling to be more like Washington.
Hogan&#39;s subordinates have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And towards the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued him because of it.
The governor&#39;s staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and online comments swarmed with &quot;Who cares?&quot;-style backlash.
&quot;It&#39;s just Facebook,&quot; many said.
But it does count.
And that counts especially when it&#39;s a guy like Hogan.
This is an incredibly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
His approval rating ranks second best among the nation&#39;s 50 governors.
Hogan is not a hothead who reacts without thinking.
He has ruled the state with a firm hand and has remained firm on his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook quite adeptly as the main tool to communicate with his constituents, for example, cheerfully presenting his bald head for the first time after chemotherapy.
So blocking people visiting the governor&#39;s page — which is an officially labeled public forum run by staff paid by taxpayer dollars — is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan&#39;s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor&#39;s behavior, saying the blocking of comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it&#39;s too easy to paint a picture of internet trolls, spammers or angry people on the web.
The Post spoke with several real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And that&#39;s exactly what they are - real people communicating with their elected leaders. A teacher, business owner and pastor, not internet trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not at all rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasizing Hogan&#39;s Catholicism.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Maryland, did not incite hate, but actual hate crimes.
&quot;I politely commented that I was disappointed that he had not responded to the hate crimes or other recent news,&quot; he wrote in the comments section of The Post&#39;s news story.
&quot;I also don&#39;t like the idea that when a lot of people are commenting on the same issue, some of them call it a collective effort instead of recognizing that it&#39;s a large number of concerned citizens.&quot;
What the governor&#39;s staff called a &quot;targeted spam attack&quot; others would probably call &quot;public support.&quot;
The age of Facebook makes it easy to match messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It&#39;s a lot cleaner than in the old days, when you had to send out workers to collect critical editorials and burn them, or arrest protesters and silence them.
But that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for making Facebook and other social media outlets toothless.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first landmark rulings on this issue was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that the chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment when she blocked a voter from her Facebook page.
In Kentucky, the ACLU also went after Gov. Matt Bevin (R) over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn&#39;t be that hard.
In Washington&#39;s time, affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous letter writers ridiculed his leadership style.
And even then, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, trashing Washington&#39;s decisions.
His cabinet was buried under petitions criticizing his views on friendship, trade and shipping treaties with Britain, according to historical documents compiled by the online Project to Collect George Washington&#39;s Letters.
But he did not force them to be silent.
Freedom of speech, dissent and debate are the cornerstones of our country.
And good leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty will rely on the comfort of home turf at the Renaissance Club
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for the comfort of home turf over the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place on the golf courses at the Renaissance Club in East Lothian.
The Northern Irishman, who last year led the way to the final round at neighboring Archerfield Links before being sworn in by Paul Eales, has grown fond of the new venue and will act as tournament ambassador in place of club founder and chief executive Jerry Sarvad.
&quot;I saw the Renaissance Club being built and now we&#39;re seeing the club shine in all its glory with this event,&quot; said Rafferty.
&quot;The players will see the course at its best, it&#39;s in brilliant condition.
Jerry has done a great job building this place.
He is an avid supporter of the game of golf and is proud of what he has achieved here.
It allows for a perfect presentation of the track.&quot;
Englishman Eales is looking forward to his first defense of the championship, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
&quot;It&#39;s a very special feeling,&quot; said the Southport-based player.
&quot;I couldn&#39;t defend my Extremadura Open title because it was taken off the competition calendar a year after I won it.
It&#39;s magical to come back to this place.
This is a great place to play golf.
I have memories from last year, for me and my wife Sharon last year&#39;s win was special.
It was a very special time that we will always carry in our hearts.&quot;
Gary Orr, who joined the senior European tour towards the beginning of this year when he turned 50, is also returning to competition on home soil.
This is his first event in Scotland since participating in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
&quot;Playing at home is always a bit more meaningful,&quot; Helensburgh man Orr said.
&quot;You want to perform well, but at the same time you feel extra pressure.
I have enjoyed playing again immensely and have shown some pretty decent golf.
I&#39;m happy with how things are going so far.&quot;
The trio will be joined in the field by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in contention, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entry is free and car parking costs £5 for a car with one passenger and £10 for a car with two or more passengers.
All proceeds go to the charity Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in Indonesia&#39;s gold-rich land
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn&#39;t use the stove.
He rarely even uses the potty.
In a wooden hut in Enarotal, the capital of Paniai regency in Indonesia&#39;s recalcitrant Papua province, a housewife places a sweet potato, called nota in the local language, directly on the stove.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed from the heat and eagerly poked into the skin with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor - he has no furniture - and it&#39;s also where he does his daily chores, such as washing clothes with murky water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room plays the role of a toilet.
Being the youngest of her husband&#39;s four wives, she is not assigned to tend any of the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
However, working late can be dangerous - most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink heavily, and there are also soldiers here.
&quot;No one dares to walk around the village after five o&#39;clock in the evening,&quot; he says.
This is a rare glimpse into life in the highlands of Papua. It is a former Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which just 1,026 elderly people were forced to vote by raising their hands in front of occupying forces.
The movement, which had been calling for liberation from Dutch rule, quickly turned its fury against the Jakarta government, which still maintains its tight grip on the region, shutting out foreign journalists and human rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, leaving independent Papua New Guinea with the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is both a remote and desolate place. Getting here requires a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, followed by a nauseating five-hour journey by rental car.
There is no public transport.
With a population of about 19,000, the town consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered by corrugated iron roofs that rust has turned to various shades of yellow-brown.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and almost no foreigners have visited.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuans of Mee Pago worshiped a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
&quot;We weren&#39;t used to wearing clothes like this,&quot; says Degei, referring to her colorful handwoven turban, dark blouse and bright skirt.
&quot;Before that, we only wore plant leaves on our bodies.&quot;
Papua is Indonesia&#39;s poorest province, with 28% of people living below the poverty line and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics among the worst in Asia.
But it is also a land rich in gold in Indonesia.
Just 100 km from Pania, a mountainous province about the size of New Jersey with a population of 153,000, is the world&#39;s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about US$3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua boasts timber reserves estimated to be worth US$78 billion.
But these riches are a source of suffering for Papuans because they provide the suffocating presence of the powerful Indonesian military.
A 2005 investigation by The New York Times found that Freeport paid local military personnel and military units approximately US$20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to US$150,000 per officer.
Papuan aspirations for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are dealt with mercilessly.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killings in the 1970s in Papua&#39;s tribal highlands amounted to genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
The Archdiocese of Birsbane&#39;s 2016 report &#39;We&#39;re Losing Everything&#39; includes evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (rape and electric shocks are particularly common, according to another report) and the brutal suppression of peaceful protests.
&quot;It&#39;s hard to count the number of victims because these kinds of incidents happen every week,&quot; says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have been tightened even more because Papua&#39;s natural resources have caused an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the province&#39;s 3.5 million residents are Christian, but the demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia&#39;s populous islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese family restaurants sell gado-gado with crispy chicken and mixed vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Locals can&#39;t compete with them.
&quot;Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables at the traditional market cheaper than local Papuans,&quot; explains 24-year-old Abeth You, born in Pania, who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital, for work.
&quot;Indigenous Papuans – the Papuan mama-mama [women] – are losing their market share as a result.&quot;
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address these inequalities and human rights abuses in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter won 27 of Papua&#39;s 29 constituencies, including Paniai, on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But very little has changed in Papua and the locals feel cheated.
&quot;Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 expecting him to fulfill our hopes for restoring justice,&quot; You says.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniai was struggling in a slump.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children were singing Christmas carols around a fire in Enarotal when two Indonesian soldiers appeared out of the darkness on a motorcycle.
The terrified children told them they should turn on their headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and witnesses, drunken soldiers chased the children and beat them with the handles of their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so brutally that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby election commission building was set on fire, and things escalated further the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on the soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua, which involved running around and imitating birdsong.
Some protesters started throwing stones at the police and military.
As resentment grew, an order was sent to the soldiers via internal radio. &quot;If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them,&quot; the official document, seen by TIME magazine but not released to local media, said.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, an elder in Kego Koto district of Enarotali town, sensed the impending danger and appealed for calm, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
&quot;As I turned around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist,&quot; he told TIME magazine on the porch of his brightly colored treehouse.
Kayame still doesn&#39;t know who the shooter was, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
&quot;There were a lot of people, there were a lot of shots,&quot; he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shooting.
&quot;I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,&quot; Yohanes, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, told TIME somberly.
&quot;I saw he was dead... I kissed him.&quot;
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates were only ensuring the security of their station because it had been attacked.
&quot;We have to defend ourselves when we are threatened with death,&quot; Papuan police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
&quot;It&#39;s a matter of life and death.&quot;
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
News of the killings did not reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, offering condolences to the families of the victims and vowing to address the abuses in Papua.
&quot;I want to solve this case now so that it never happens again in the future,&quot; he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would establish an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve the crimes against human rights that had occurred.
But apologies followed almost immediately.
“Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes,&quot; he said.
However, speaking to TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, Wiranto took back his words, saying he had no intention of creating a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, &quot;everything will be resolved according to the law.&quot;
Wiranto, who has been accused by the United Nations of human rights crimes in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during a bloody 1999 independence referendum, said 11 human rights crimes had already been resolved in Papua, including the one in Pania.
The families of Paniai&#39;s victims met such claims with grim disbelief.
&quot;I have been interrogated four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress,&quot; said Yohanes.
&quot;I&#39;m tired.&quot;
She says she still lives in fear years later.
&quot;I&#39;m afraid,&quot; he says.
&quot;I&#39;m afraid the military will arrest me, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll be shot.&quot;
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people of Paniai are afraid to dissect the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
&quot;After the bodies were buried, the army came looking for me,&quot; he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Deiyai, neighboring Paniai regency.
One person was killed and 17 injured, including children, when there was an argument between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to transport the unconscious man to the hospital.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned in a nearby river while fishing, died on the way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company&#39;s office at the construction site.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the policemen, to which the latter responded with warning shots.
But according to locals, the mobile brigade (Indonesian military police) started shooting at the crowd, killing one person.
&quot;We were in a big panic, we are afraid of retaliation,&quot; 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the injured being brought in, told TIME magazine.
&quot;I&#39;ve been hiding in my house for two days.&quot;
The Deiyai parliament has demanded the prosecution of the policemen involved and the withdrawal of the police mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development fuels the discontent of the Mee, Moni, Dan and Damal tribes living in Papua&#39;s verdant central highlands.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of Papuans by carrying out random attacks and kidnapping raids among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the VPL are from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of people in Pania over the past few years under the pretext of &quot;protecting the country&#39;s sovereignty&quot;.
Some of them never appear again.
Among the Papuan people, Pania is known as &quot;the tragic forgotten place&quot;.
Poverty breeds discontent.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotal is too expensive for the locals to buy.
Bread is just as unavailable.
People grow all their own food - mostly sweet potatoes, with some fruit and leafy greens.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can tend four or five sweet potato fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, and sell the rest at the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequality between native Papuans and new migrants, who have arrived in large numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire Airport, has deepened.
The few jobs that do exist go to better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuans themselves often lack the capital or skills to run a competitive business.
&quot;Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there are no jobs or money here,&quot; says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, severe restrictions remain on foreign media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua for &quot;not following appropriate practices&quot;, despite being granted a rare filming permit.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy head of Human Rights Watch&#39;s Asia division, Jokowi&#39;s election promises to remove restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
&quot;In Indonesia, journalists trying to report from the easternmost restive provinces of Papua and West Papua face new threats of visa denial and blacklisting,&quot; he said in a statement.
The absence of a penetrating gaze from the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to Papua&#39;s immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate &quot;various large-scale crimes&quot; in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the VPL.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group&#39;s accusations, telling reporters in Jakarta: &quot;Indonesia still has a democratic system and freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to bury evidence of human rights violations.&quot;
Local people want more foreign governments to take notice.
When an official Dutch delegation, led by the country&#39;s human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence by imploring, &quot;We want freedom,&quot; according to a source present at the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Indonesia will hold new presidential elections in 2019, but Papuans do not think they will vote for Jokowi again.
&quot;Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Paniai shooting,&quot; says tribal council chairman Hobai.
He wants to convey to Jokowi that, in addition to living under the constant threat of a predatory military, the people of Paniai are also languishing in poverty due to poor education and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, see their vote for Jokowi as a debt he has to pay.
&quot;They don&#39;t need money, they want justice,&quot; he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai shooting victims managed one last symbolic protest - they buried the body of one of the victims on land opposite the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they don&#39;t let those responsible forget their crimes.
&quot;One of our family members was killed,&quot; Yacobus says with his head down.
&quot;What else could we do?&quot;
Fire engulfed the Dubai Torch skyscraper for the second time
Fire tore through one of the world&#39;s tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-tall, 79-story structure.
This is the second fire to ravage the high-rise, which happens to be called the Torch, in just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no immediate cause of the fire was given.
&quot;We were sleeping and woke up to a fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor,&quot; one resident, who identified himself as George, told Reuters.
Dubai Civil Defense officials said firefighters extinguished the blaze at around 4 a.m. local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they are working to provide shelter to the victims.
This incident could once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the Torch Board after the 2015 fire found that the cladding - exterior decorative panels and insulation - suffered the most damage.
Police in Britain have said they believe insulation and facade panels at London&#39;s Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June that killed around 80 people.
Look: these phones will probably be bestsellers in the fall
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, because that&#39;s when phone manufacturers unveil their new top models.
Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium went on sale in the spring, new hit phones are expected to hit the store shelves in the fall as well.
According to Tele2 marketing and sales director Kristjan Seema, this year&#39;s flagships are characterized by an innovative design, an iris scanner, an edge-to-edge 4K resolution screen and a super-fast processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8 caused great excitement in the technology world, which has also reached the top of the Estonian smartphone sales chart.
Autumn promises even faster fast charging, a more durable battery, a higher quality camera and greater water and dust resistance for smart enthusiasts.
He added that based on rumors, one can already make assumptions and predict the four top models that will probably conquer this year&#39;s sales charts.
These four top smartphone models will hit store shelves in the fall of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should hit the shelves in mid-September.
There are many rumors about what the new Apple model will look like and what can be done with it.
If the iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences next to the iPhone 6s, on the occasion of Apple&#39;s tenth birthday, it is expected that the new model will be completely different from the previous ones.
Four colors have been mentioned: black, white, rose gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is apparently a screen that covers the entire front panel of the phone, the home button is gone and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
JonyIve, Apple&#39;s head of design, insists that the new iPhone model will look like smooth glass.
There has also been talk of a ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to an iris scanner, wireless charging and an even better camera, you can expect a faster A11 processor.
It is definitely one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
Pre-orders for the brand new Galaxy Note 8 will begin on August 23.
Many rumors have been leaked about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
Rumor has it that it is intended even more for the business user, and the S Pen allows for even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one wide-angle and the other telephoto with a narrower field of view.
At the moment, no one knows what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung&#39;s first attempt, which is definitely comparable to the iPhone 8 in terms of quality.
However, we are eagerly waiting for August 23.
Although Nokia has launched three smartphones this year, led by Nokia 6, their flagship - Nokia 8, which will be presented on August 16, is still missing.
We expect a 5.3-inch edge-to-edge display from Nokia and a super-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of an aluminum body and a significant degree of water and dust resistance IP68.
Similar to Samsung, Nokia&#39;s new model has two rear cameras, the optics of which are produced by Zeiss.
While Sony&#39;s firm flagship has been the XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two more smartphones with even more innovative features will be added in the near future.
We are waiting for a smartphone that is a little more modest than the XZ Premium, but with at least as good or a better camera.
Sony&#39;s new model has been speculated to have a screen of at least six inches.
We will be able to see what reality will bring soon, because traditionally Sony has announced its autumn flagship at the international technology fair IFA, which this year will be held from 1 to 6. until September.
According to leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post released the transcripts of the phone calls between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and the heads of state of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly announcing that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The American president scolded him for publicly condemning the wall, saying, &quot;You can&#39;t say that to the press.&quot;
Trump built his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal to see the United States take in refugees heading to Australia was &quot;ridiculous&quot;, &quot;disgusting&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot;. He argued that the deal, which was made during the Obama administration, would make him look like a &quot;leader&quot; because he has proposed a ban on refugee resettlement in the United States.
Trump ended the speech by telling Turnbull it was &quot;the most unpleasant speech of the day&quot;.
The Supreme Court did not consider OÜ MRP Linna Liinid&#39;s appeal in the case where the city of Tartu rejected their offer for the procurement of bus services from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a directive that rejected OÜ MRP Linna Liinid&#39;s bid for the Tartu bus procurement, as the bid did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, head of the Tartu City Government Legal Service.
This is a procurement of public bus service within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP Linna Liinid appealed the decision of the Tartu District Court to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court did not take it up.
Although many complain on social media that the noise from the Weekend festival disturbs their sleep and the whole city is full of drunken revelers, there are also many who have nothing bad to say about the beach festival.
I am even positively surprised that the celebrants in the store were so polite!
I didn&#39;t see any shadyness or rudeness.
I even saw kindness&quot;, says the lime-haired Laine.
&quot;It&#39;s nice that people come, stay and feel the joy of Pärnu, which has remained like a hibernation during the winter&quot;, he adds happily.
Laine&#39;s sleep is not disturbed by the roaring sound of the beach.
While living in the city center, he still heard that music was being played on the beach, but now the music has not yet reached the walls of his home.
&quot;But I hope I can,&quot; he says cheerfully.
Agnes, who spoke to Õhtulehe, also says that the big festival is rather good for Pärnu - it helps a lot with the turnover of local merchants.
In addition, he is happy that so many foreigners have come to visit the summer capital.
The fun of the parties does not disturb the woman.
Even though I don&#39;t sunbathe on the beach anymore, it&#39;s nice that the beach has revived.
And it&#39;s nice that the people are moving, and it&#39;s already happened three times,&quot; says the woman.
I think it was a bit worse the first time.
&quot;Maybe there were complaints then&quot;, he reflects.
However, according to him, the fun on the beach is normal for summer residents.
&quot;This Weekend is a very good promo for our small town&quot;, says Harri, basking in the park.
Fun and tumult haven&#39;t shaken the rhythm of his life either.
But for what?!
We should all stick together.
To think how this inter-ethnic communication would be better.
Loud music does not crush a man.
It doesn&#39;t bother me even though I live close by.
&quot;Good people can save and there is no trouble&quot;, he says.
According to him, the guests who come to Pärnu are polite.
&quot;Of course, they have exaggerated a bit with the bottles, but young people are young and my God - let them go, but be human and we will manage!&quot; he says.
By then, the residents of the beach have traveled somewhere far away, either to relatives or acquaintances.
&quot;But in general, the festival affects life positively - people like this kind of fun&quot;, says Tiina, who was walking with children in Pärnu.
His family&#39;s sleep is not disturbed by festival music either, although last year it sounded even further than this year.
Last summer the stage was on the other side, then we heard more.
We live outside the city, so it actually sounds quite well far away by the Pärnu river&quot;, he says.
Pearson is cutting another 3,000 jobs and cutting its dividend to revive the business
British education company Pearson said on Friday it would cut a further 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent, launching another restructuring program to address a looming business crisis.
The job losses, which CEO John Fallon says are most likely to be cut in late 2018 and early 2019, are on top of the 4,000 lost in the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced plans to cut costs by a further £300 million (US$394 million) as part of a third cost-cutting program to try to revive a business hit by a rapid shift to digital learning.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann, said its outlook for the year was unchanged after reporting a 1 percent rise in sales to £2.05bn in the first half of the year.

Convoy attack in Kabul: a NATO soldier was killed in a suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials said.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the city&#39;s Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest in a string of acts of violence to hit Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 people killed in an attack on a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said Thursday night&#39;s explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with a &quot;man-made improvised explosive device&quot;.
All of the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at a US military hospital at Bagram Airfield, the statement said.
According to correspondents, the ever-growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) in Qarabagh is a serious concern for NATO forces based in Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, approximately 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On May 31, a major bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people, the deadliest military attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Trump weighs whether to increase the number of U.S. troops assisting the country&#39;s military and police.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and especially President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPA reversed its decision to delay the smog regulation after the lawsuits
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era regulation requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced the decision to proceed with &quot;2015 ozone determination activities&quot; late Wednesday, saying it demonstrates the agency&#39;s commitment to working with states.
&quot;We believe we need to engage in dialogue with and listen to our state partners,&quot; EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA&#39;s intention to delay ozone determinations -- which measure smog pollution in different parts of the country to determine where levels should be reduced to meet tougher air quality standards -- by one year to October 2018.
Fifteen mostly Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit Tuesday saying the decision is illegal.
President Donald Trump&#39;s administration has attempted to roll back several environmental regulations put in place by former President Barack Obama. According to Trump, this is part of a broader plan to boost economic growth.
But those efforts have sparked a backlash from Democrats and conservation groups, who are concerned about the impact of increased pollutants on human health.
The EPA&#39;s website states that breathing ozone-containing air &quot;can reduce lung capacity and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases,&quot; such as asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
Germany&#39;s pigs and cattle may have a party, as heavy rains threaten the harvest of the European Union&#39;s second largest wheat producer, writes Bloomberg.
This year, it may happen that weeks of rainstorms before the harvest may mean that the grain intended for the bread industry is only suitable for animal feed.
&quot;The quality of wheat is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015,&quot; said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat may be used as animal feed, which is twice as much as usual, Agravis predicted.
German farmers, like their European counterparts, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
First, the winter was too dry.
Then came a cold spring, which was replaced by a heat wave in June.
Germany was hit by rainstorms in July, which have continued in August.
Many eyes are on northern Germany, where rain is hampering the harvest.
So far, only five percent of the wheat has been harvested.
Harvesting has not even started in most of the region, the local harvest buyer Ceravis said.
&quot;These are pretty difficult days,&quot; said Ceravis senior trader Frank Deckert of Rendsburg.
Harmony in everything, or the clever swings of Finnish interior design
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of fair homes, because through the large windows, the unparalleled views of Saimaa&#39;s shores reach many (living) rooms.
At every step, the effort of our northern neighbors to create both crisp and perfect (energy-saving) homes is noticeable.
The Finns&#39; ability to use wood as a building and finishing material, in the manufacture of furniture and beauty items, deserves admiration and also following.
Both the builder and the (home) designer can find exhilarating techniques and smart solutions in the exhibition buildings.
It clearly shows that combinations of black, white and gray shades, if they are complemented by wood tones and indoor plants, can be very cheerful.
You can pick up good ideas for another week, because the fair lasts until August 13.
Accessories and herb pots suggest that this kitchen is often used for cooking.
Last night, the line was drawn for this year&#39;s Weekend Festival Baltic, and Martin Garrix gave everything on the main stage to be remembered as the last performer.
The crowd really went wild during Garrix&#39;s performance - they sang, booed, and danced self-consciously.
When Garrix finished, a collective mass poured out from the beach of Pärnu onto the city.
We bring you a gallery with all the pictures that our photographer captured during the three days of the Weekend.
You are surely one of them too, look for yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to go head-to-head in the most compelling boxing match of the near future in the 66.7kg weight class, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at the ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council featherweight champion, walked across the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization featherweight champion.
Following Garcia&#39;s unanimous decision victory over former four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Showtime Saturday, both fighters are ranked in the top five of the weight rankings.
Garcia held out his right hand and said, “How are you, champ?
I wish you luck.&quot;
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marria Saturday night at 7pm on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko&#39;s manager, Egis Klimas, noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be &quot;the perfect measure.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m a former featherweight,&quot; Garcia recalled.
“I moved up [to 63.5kg] for Broner, but I&#39;m not that big.
I am small for 63.5 kg.
I want to move down to lightweight.
And he has to move up to lightweight [61.2kg] and then we can fight.
Fans have been asking for it.
So let&#39;s offer them that.&quot;
Lomachenko agreed.
&quot;The boxing world needs this fight.&quot;
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be paid to watch. It&#39;s part of his strategy to have Lomachenko make his 61.2kg debut towards the end of this year to make a matchup with Garcia (37-0, 30 KOs) possible next summer, who is also interested in a Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell matchup with the winner following their September 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.
&quot;This fight could be a pay-per-view because the fans have been asking for this fight,&quot; Garcia said, later saying he was open to fighting on whichever channel offered the best financial package.
&quot;We are the main makers.
No other name can command so much attention.
Whenever they are ready…”
Garcia said he thinks Lomachenko is a &quot;great fighter&quot; and may go see his fight on Saturday.
However, Lomachenko was modest in his praise of Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked &quot;very slow; sorry Mikey... you wanted that knockout.&quot;
According to Garcia, the goal was to show punching power and then box.
Both confirmed that they could feel the tension building for a showdown between them.
&quot;This is a fight waiting to be realized.
No other matchup generates as much attention and buzz.
I&#39;m more than willing to work for it,&quot; Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I&#39;ve been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
It&#39;s going to be a good fight.&quot;
From which corners of the world do people move to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) extended and issued a record number of over 13,000 residence permits to citizens of third countries, who have mostly traveled to Estonia to work, study or visit family.
For example, if last year it was decided to issue temporary residence permits to 6,702 foreigners, then last year this number was 4,928.
The authorities cannot say how many immigrants will eventually stay in Estonia permanently, but such an analysis is prepared in the Ministry of the Interior.
While ten years ago nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia annually, in recent years this number has been approaching 2,000.
The number of residence permit applicants increased dramatically during the Ukrainian crisis - in 2014, 1,087 people received temporary residence permits, compared to 675 a year earlier.
According to Statistics Estonia, the number of Ukrainian citizens is growing the most in Estonia - last year, 850 more Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia than left.
&quot;The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia, and due to the difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that work and study opportunities are sought in a country where the community and, for many, also the family, are already in front of them&quot;, stated the spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior, Kristin Rammus.
Last year and the year before last, the number of Ukrainians who received a temporary residence permit was even greater than the number of Russian citizens, although in ten years the largest number of temporary residence permits have been issued to the latter.
While Ukrainians mostly come here to work, Russian citizens come here for family migration.
&quot;Considering the historical Russian community here, they are more likely to have the largest family ties with people living in Russia,&quot; said Helina Maasing, a migration researcher at the Internal Defense Academy.
&quot;If you look at where Russian citizens who have received an Estonian residence permit have moved to live, Ida-Virumaa is right after Harjumaa&quot;, he added and pointed out that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1,696 Russian citizens received a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to extend their residence permit decreased.
&quot;The jump is due to the fact that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for permanently settling in Estonia,&quot; explained Rammus, the spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior, according to whom Russian citizens&#39; interest in the Estonian residence permit has remained rather stable for years.
Foreigners who have lived here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit to permanently settle in Estonia from the previous year.
Its purpose is to encourage people who have adapted to stay here.
However, the residence permit of a long-term resident requires, for example, five years.
Because of the new residence permit, the extension of the old residence permit has apparently also decreased.
For example, last year such a residence permit was granted to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
Now, Ukrainians can change jobs, and the Estonian state will no longer check whether the salary criterion has been met.
This residence permit became very popular - applicants last year included gray passport holders (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
In total, 1,968 people received residence permits for the purpose of settling in Estonia, among them, for example, 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1,269.
In ten years, surprisingly, Nigeria has become a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
While three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, 200 last year.
People come from Nigeria to study at the universities here.
Estonian universities are also popular among, for example, Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased mainly due to educational migration.
In their case, too, the rule applies that where a community has already formed, it is easier for others to join,&quot; added Rammus.
In the course of ten years, two people have moved to Estonia from, for example, North Korea, the same number from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If approximately 6,000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit per year, this is approximately 0.46 percent of the entire population.
Even if you add the citizens of the European Union, migration remains at around one percent&quot;, Maasing commented that the numbers are actually small.
According to the statistics office, a total of 14,822 people immigrated to Estonia last year, while 13,792 left here.
This means that immigration exceeded emigration for the second year running.
Most of the people moving out and moving in are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among those leaving.
Therefore, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was in the red by 2,000 people last year.
Estonians mainly travel between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture&#39;s princess fashion enchants with frills, embroidery and tulle
Maria Tammeoru still has history in the bottomless box of ideas - old paintings and costumes: &quot;I can spend hours dreaming somewhere in a museum and admiring vintage sleeves and collars.
When you do something with passion, you research and learn more about it every day.
It&#39;s a joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may seem alien to some, but the designer doesn&#39;t think so.
You yourself decide how much sparkle there is in your life!
I have a friend who has an entire sauna full of haute couture dresses I&#39;ve created.
Because it&#39;s not her fault that she doesn&#39;t live in Hollywood and doesn&#39;t walk the red carpet every day, she also wants to wear the most beautiful dresses and she does!
You can live your own special life!
The fashion designer does not recognize the gap between bright events and gray everyday life.
It was this train of thought that set in motion the plan to bring haute couture to rural areas in Estonia, between forests and fields, to people whom fashion often does not reach.
The Mammu collection was presented, for example, in Võru, Jõhvi and Pärnu Fashion Alley, where a royal parade with 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, people often strike a pose, nod with dignity, but elsewhere there are more emotions - they shout bravo, stand up, want to thank you with their hands.
A large part of the audience came just to find out, but now they are fans of Mammu Couture.
When you exceed people&#39;s expectations, they are thrilled!
And I love the feeling of being on a summer tour with my fashion creations.
In Pärnu, we had a 50-meter long red carpet, the whole street was full of beautiful dresses, it seemed that there would be no end to them!
Maria also does not accept fashion that a super slim supermodel should present her creations, she willingly brings ordinary women on stage.
I often invite my own clients to the stage - they are always happy to come.
It&#39;s such a cool experience, you can shine on stage in a gorgeous dress!
I&#39;m so sorry that I&#39;ve never seen my own performance, I&#39;m always backstage putting the finishing touches on things as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerves wouldn&#39;t allow me to calmly watch from the hall.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who doesn&#39;t just want to play a representative role, but to be hands-on in everything.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio, I make most of the collection myself.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, discover.
I am never far from my creations and I am not afraid of work.
The matter is not limited to design, also stylistics, logistics, arrangement, organization - everything has to fit into one temperamental woman&#39;s day.
These working hours are still huge for fanatics.
I can&#39;t say when my working day ends, for me it&#39;s just a day full of joy!
I&#39;m still very lucky - it&#39;s like an unending chain of happiness: I do something beautiful, the person receives something beautiful, and in turn, compliments.
It has been said many times that there is magic in my dresses - they make you feel like a princess.
The rich rows of tulle frills that made Maria&#39;s talent famous overnight have remained Mammu Couture&#39;s signature to this day.
Martin Müürsepp from the U18 boys: the weapon of the Estonian subgroup tournament was now turned against us
Too bad, the fairy tale ended.
The first thing that stood out was that we couldn&#39;t get our table.
And if there&#39;s such a big gap in the table, there&#39;s nothing to do&quot;, commented our only basketball player who played in the NBA, BC Kalev/Cramo assistant coach Martin Müürsepp, about the 61:75 defeat of the Estonian U18 basketball boys to Great Britain.
Opponents took 28 balls off the offensive board and got that much more offense because of it.
We were also not ready for their aggressive defense or attack, it created .
A lot of English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn&#39;t build a defense.
In defense, however, they managed to keep their hands between each other, we could not combine.
It knocked the team down.
The opponents&#39; homework was better done.
According to the mason, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to nip the opponents&#39; momentum in the bud.
Even in the last quarter - we had zero mistakes, but the opponents already got several quick baskets.
The athleticism and tight attacking, which was our weapon in the group stage, now turned against us.
Today we had no strength against their aggression.
The mason was satisfied with his protégé in Kalevi, Matthias Tassi.
In the tournament in general, good words can be said about the whole team, until today there was a unified punch.
It&#39;s a pity that you haven&#39;t met such an aggressive opponent before.
Tass has been confident all along and played his field even today, but it seemed that he was tired - he has carried quite a load.
But he made some very beautiful moves, which I have seen in training before&quot;, added the instructor.
Terrible numbers: the girls&#39; basketball team scored less than 10 points in three quarters at the EC tournament...
In the U18 age group, not only the young men&#39;s EC B-division basketball tournament is held in Tallinn, the girls started the day before yesterday in Dublin.
And Estonia&#39;s game with Poland, unfortunately, tended to be in the realm of anti-records.
Estonia lost 25:65, but even after the third quarter the score was 9:49, i.e. only in the last ten minutes did the opponents take their foot off the gas pedal and that period remained tied 16:16.
Estonia scored 4 points in both the first and second quarter, 1 point in the third...
At the beginning, the Estonian women hit two of the first four shots in two minutes, then 25 missed the game, then one three-pointer and then another 21 shots...
In other words, in almost half an hour, one shot was hit out of 47.
In addition, 2 points came from 4 free throws.
There was a reasonable number of turnovers during that time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland&#39;s shooting percentage was 33 and Estonia&#39;s 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, on the opening day we had to admit the superiority of Portugal 83:56.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to replenish supplies
Today, NATO&#39;s 1st permanent mine countermeasures group arrived in Tallinn for a planned port visit for the weekend to replenish the ships&#39; supplies and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships make preparations to return to sea and give the crew members the opportunity to rest for a few days.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to conduct several exercises and be ready for future operations to search for historical explosive devices.
&quot;Estonians&#39; participation in the NATO unit and the joint training they carry out in local waters well illustrates our integration with the allied forces&quot;, said Captain Major Arto Reinmaa, the commander of the operation and planning department, who is the commander of the navy&#39;s fleet.
Starting from June 29, the 1st permanent mine countermeasures group of NATO will be led by the Latvian naval lieutenant captain Gvido Laudups, who took over the tasks of the group commander from the Estonian naval officer captain Johan-Elias Seljamaa at a ceremony held in Riga.
The flagship of the group is the support ship of the Latvian Navy LVNS Virsaitis, on which the group&#39;s command staff also operates.
This semester, the Estonian Navy minesweeper Sakala is part of the international unit.
As one of the four ship groups under NATO Maritime Command, NATO&#39;s 1st Permanent Mine Countermeasures Group is a first-responder readiness unit that the alliance can deploy to various locations around the world within five days.
From August 4 to 13, the ancient ruins of the Pirita monastery will once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, launched 13 years ago by maestro Eri Klas, will be held.
According to Risto Joost (36), artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonic, this year&#39;s Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: The audience will be treated to the classics of the opera world, including &quot;Traviata&quot; and &quot;Tosca&quot;, ballet productions from the enchanting &quot;Bolero&quot; to the fun &quot;Karlsson&quot;, and there will also be an in-house production on the schedule, which is this time a production of Joseph Haydn&#39;s wonderful oratorio &quot;The Seasons&quot; by the same international creative team that In 2015, Pirital brought Haydn&#39;s second masterpiece &quot;Creation&quot; to the stage.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theater productions.
It is bigger than any musical theater in its usual form.
It is a festival whose enchantment takes over and never quite lets go.
Because the experience that the listener gets in this sublime and mysterious environment makes the human soul ring and touches the human senses in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you are the artistic director of Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn&#39;t maestro Eri Klas&#39;s shoes seem a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it has been very helpful.
He guided me throughout my student career and supported me at the beginning of my conducting career.
Maybe that makes it easier for me to continue his work.
Eri Klas has injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team, and of course all of this is transferred to me as well.
It was great to join a team that knows exactly how things work.
It was the big heart of Eri Klas that gave me the strength to go ahead with the Birgitta Festival in the Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am now and I can do it!
What could excite the audience at this year&#39;s festival, what special offer do you have?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania, and as a surprise, the first ballet written to Astrid Lindgren&#39;s story will be presented.
That&#39;s what &quot;Karlsson flies&quot; is for.
And one curious nuance about this is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed his desire to write this work.
Apparently, Karlsson&#39;s character has lived in his soul since he was a child.
Risto, how do you manage all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner for sure.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and luckily I have plenty of that.
And I&#39;ve noticed that my personal emotions don&#39;t depend so much on other people, but on myself, that is, how I face each new day.
And this kind of conscious tone-keeping, staying positive and actually smiling at myself in the mirror in the morning, greatly increased my happiness percentage.
Especially now this week with the most important rehearsals, I&#39;ve been practicing it extra hard and it&#39;s working.
Smiling to yourself activates the brain and raises the tone.
It&#39;s not just lip service.
I think that people still don&#39;t know half of the things about their body that the universe offers them, but everyone discovers it little by little.
Now, now, the moment is here.
Do you also have a ritual before stepping into the conductor&#39;s console?
It&#39;s still there, you have to change your clothes for more comfortable ones.
It&#39;s this little moment for yourself.
But generally yes, I don&#39;t get a chance to rest or take a nap before a big performance.
In fact, I even like to actively interact with people, even before I step on the conductor&#39;s desk.
But everyone, come to the Birgitta Festival, there is something to discover here even for the not-so-big opera and ballet fans!
Watch a fun video with Risto Joost!
The new results of age assessment tests for Swedish asylum seekers were published
In Sweden, a test was conducted among asylum seekers, during which their age was assessed medically with a new approach. The most recent results of the test show that more than 80 percent of those tested were judged to be older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started the tests towards the beginning of this year.
The tests were created to more accurately assess age during the asylum application process after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to correctly determine the age of a number of allegedly underage refugees.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the Institute of Forensic Medicine has issued a total of 2,481 test results between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases, the Institute of Forensic Medicine assessed that the subject &quot;may be 18 years of age or older.&quot;
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the person was &quot;probably younger than 18&quot;.
Tests are only used if a person&#39;s age is in doubt.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent compared to those of the previous months.
&quot;We don&#39;t see a big difference compared to the statistics from previous months, the numbers are pretty consistent,&quot; he told The Local.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were judged to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The institute released the results of 581 tests in May and said that in 442 cases &quot;there are indications that the subject is 18 years of age or older.&quot;
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of these 581 tests, it was found that in 243 cases the person had directly stated that they would turn 18 this year.
This medical age-estimating method, which involves X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRIs of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticized in some quarters.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing people&#39;s biological maturity to determine whether they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
&quot;I&#39;ve had reason to think about it and I don&#39;t think the current measurement method should be used.
Determining biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can&#39;t say for sure, we shouldn&#39;t pretend we can,&quot; he told the Metro newspaper.
But Johan Göransson from the Institute of Forensic Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: &quot;In general, it can be said that the risk of inaccurately classifying a child as an adult is small.
The risk is the highest, at around 10%, if the person is a little under 18.&quot;

The 20-year-old hammer thrower Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut at the London WC, taking a good 18th place with 67.37.
Orel was the youngest female hammer thrower at the WC, and the cheerful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and I got a good experience.
In the first attempt (64.80) I immediately made my average result, in the second (62.80) I risked too much and in the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear&quot;, said Orel after the competition.
I was looking for my shed and I&#39;m so glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel&#39;s WC debut ended with a good 18th place.
The rain didn&#39;t bother Orel, because he trains at the TUT stadium throughout the winter.
&quot;I&#39;m hardened,&quot; he said with a small grin.
There was almost a full house of people at the Olympic Stadium in London, did Orel sense the people around him or was he able to turn himself off?
I sensed, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it adds weight - it does!
If you compete yourself, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he is satisfied with his WC debut and that many more good competitions await him: &quot;I came here with the 32nd, or last, result of this season, I finished in 18th place.
This is a very good result.
I&#39;m 20 years old and at the World Cup - that&#39;s the only thing that matters.
I will take a good experience with me and some days I want to compete for medals.
The governor of West Virginia announced a change of party
West Virginia Democratic Gov. Jim Justice announced during a rally with President Trump Thursday night that he is switching parties.
&quot;Like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me,&quot; Governor Justice said.
&quot;Today I say to you, after much prayer and thought ... today I say to you, the people of West Virginia, that I can no longer help you as a Democratic governor.&quot;
Cheers broke out at the gathering.
&quot;So I&#39;m going to be a Republican tomorrow,&quot; Justice added.
&quot;As a coach, I would tell you it&#39;s time to play another game.&quot;
Trump had previously promised a big announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the state&#39;s only billionaire, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited the coal business from his father.
He is worth approximately $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee (RNC) released a statement Thursday night that &quot;Governor Justice&#39;s defection is yet another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather stand in the way of making the country better again than work toward it.&quot;
&quot;With 15 governorships in total and control of the lowest number of states in history, Governor Justice&#39;s announcement is just the latest repudiation of a party that is completely unled and unable to find a positive and unifying message,&quot; RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
It is no surprise that where there are many people, there are also many injured people.
Urmet, who is working in the medical tent at the weekend, told Õhtuleh yesterday that they had to distribute quite a lot of plasters.
Blisters and scratches are basic, sprains and minor falls.
Naturally also headaches, backaches and legaches.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with the wrong shoes and that&#39;s how problems arise.
The medics have also had to help a couple of visitors with major injuries - there have been a few panic attacks and also one broken leg.
We have also done stitches when a person has broken a hand or finger.
We do the smaller stitches here, we send the bigger ones to the hospital.
Watch the video to see if the celebrants ask the medics for painkillers to cure hangovers.
Coe praised the Russians&#39; honest apology for the doping scandal
International track and field leader Sebastian Coe praised what he called &quot;Russia&#39;s honest apology on Thursday&quot; for the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the time to allow the country back into the sport.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, the leader of Russian athletics, said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics that the ban imposed on his country is correct and that he has a definite goal to fight against doping.
He apologized to &quot;all the athletes whose gold and silver medals have been snatched from them in competitions&quot;.
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
&quot;I think today was a very honest response, a very honest presentation,&quot; IAAF president Coe told reporters.
&quot;The entire council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian sub-union also admitted that they have had quite difficult times and that they are doing everything possible to reorganize the sub-union.&quot;
According to Coe, he was also glad that Russia accepted the criteria for its reinstatement.
&quot;I believe today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the task force&#39;s proposal that now is not the time to withdraw Russia,&quot; Coe said.
&quot;We must do everything possible in the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always followed the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the corrupt system,&quot; he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the IAAF&#39;s strict criteria will compete as neutral athletes at the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF task force, said on Monday that Russia still does not meet several criteria for reinstatement.
After his presentation to the IAAF Council, he told reporters in London that doping controls were still inadequate and that banned coaches were still operating freely.
The electric car revolution will significantly change the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only is the electric car revolution dramatically changing everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it&#39;s also creating new winners and losers in the metals market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say they win in one place and lose in another, that doesn&#39;t help smaller mining companies.
Currently, Glencore earns from coal and oil, but in the future, in the age of electric cars, demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminum and nickel will increase.
This year, the stakes for the spread of electric cars have been raised by decisions by the governments of the UK, France and Norway, which promise to ban the sale of new cars that use fossil fuels in the coming decades.
Therefore, Volvo has already announced that they plan to abandon the internal combustion engine, and Tesla will launch a cheaper Model 3 electric car.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicts that electric cars will outsell petroleum-based cars within two decades.
&quot;For some metals, it changes everything,&quot; Simona Gambranini, commodities analyst at Capital Economics, told Bloomberg.
We&#39;ve already seen a big impact on metals like cobalt and lithium, which have been in demand for years.
Electric cars contain about three times more copper than a conventional car, Glencore said.
Even more copper is needed in charging stations, which Exane BNP Paribas estimates will increase copper demand by around five percent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore will benefit from the growing trend of electric cars from rising copper prices and from being the world&#39;s largest cobalt producer, Jefferies Group predicted.
Other winners from the EV boom include Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals, according to the brokerage.
The market is already reacting to the changing trend.
This year, cobalt has risen in price by 70 percent on the London Metal Exchange.
Last year&#39;s price increase was 37 percent.
Copper has also become more expensive this year by 14 percent, mainly due to economic growth.
Shares in Glencore rose 20 percent in London, outpacing rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
On the losing side are lead companies like Recyclex and Campine, which have to adapt to the new era.
The main end use of lead is in batteries that supply current to the starters of gasoline and diesel cars.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
&quot;This is a serious risk to lead demand unless some other purpose is found for it to overcome the decline in demand,&quot; said Michael Widmer, head of metals market analysis at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The effect of the unfolding trend has yet to be seen in the lead price movement.
Lead is up 17 percent this year, with it being the metal with the best rise in prices among the main industrial metals in London.
Investors see problems for the metal far into the future.
&quot;I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s that bad for lead because cheap oil keeps conventional cars competitive,&quot; said Herwig Schmidt, head of sales at metals brokerage Triland Metals.
When demand for lead falls, it happens slowly.
Maybe it will happen like that in about ten years.
In the meantime, however, tougher emissions standards will mean growing demand for hybrid cars that rely on advanced lead-based batteries for frequent engine starts, the International Lead and Zinc Research Organization estimates.
Light metals such as aluminum are replacing steel because a lighter car can travel further with less electricity.
This can explain the additional 1.6 million tons of aluminum mummy demand between 2013 and 2016.
This represents 2.7 percent of the total world aluminum production.
That trend is likely to worsen, Widmer said.
Aluminum has risen in price by 13 percent this year, as growing demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steelmakers don&#39;t sleep.
AK Steel Holding is partnering with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce ultra-lightweight car bodies.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy of steel to counter aluminum mummification.
&quot;High-strength steel should be the answer to this development,&quot; said Sylvain Brunet, analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.
Some progress is being seen in Europe.
The end of the oil era may also bring suffering to platinum.
Last year, about half of that precious metal was used in catalytic converters for diesel cars, metals refiner Johnson Matthey said.
&quot;Many commodities that are in high demand now, such as oil and platinum, may not be in high demand in the future,&quot; said Bernard Dahdah, commodities analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change over the course of 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe there will be continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Uncore CEO Marc Grynberg said hybrid cars will continue to outsell all-electric cars in 2025.
The big hope for platinum producers 10 years from now lies in hydrogen cell-based cars developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos, which rely on platinum to generate electricity from hydrogen.
So far, however, this technology has not yet proven itself commercially.
&quot;Diesel appears to be the clear loser on the road to electric cars,&quot; said Brunet of Exane BNP Paribas.
German automakers suffered a major setback in July when a Stuttgart court banned diesel use in the hometown of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football&#39;s financial rules affect Neymar&#39;s move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing rampant spending by European football clubs will not prevent Neymar&#39;s world-record move from Spanish club Barcelona to French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any repercussions from UEFA, the governing body that governs the European game and has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament, are yet to come for Paris Saint-Germain.
UEFA&#39;s Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules, introduced in 2011, mean that PSG must at some point prove that Neymar&#39;s transfer was financed without a huge loss.
Barcelona were paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar&#39;s salary is set to reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar&#39;s move to the French club.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to shell out that kind of money to sign Neymar and add to their star-studded line-up, given that the team is funded by the ruling family of the Qatari powerhouse.
Clubs are allowed to spend heavily to recruit players, but must balance this with legitimate income streams that allow them to make ends meet in the football business.
FFP was founded by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs who go into deep debt in search of success are actually cheating and risk going bankrupt if the banks or owners withdraw their support.
Since 2011, FFP has focused on tracking clubs&#39; losses instead of their debts.
This change means that the business model first used by Roman Abramovich at Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential and then spend heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - will be harder to implement.
During FFP&#39;s current three-year assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can incur losses of up to €30 million.
And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin remains committed to reining in excess spending.
&quot;FFP is certainly not dead and we will certainly continue to strengthen these regulations in the future,&quot; Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar&#39;s buyout clause in one lump sum, they are able to split the amount over the life of the contract for accounting purposes.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so it is possible to show the transfer fee for the next five years as an amount of 44.4 million euros per year.
In the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG received the heaviest penalties along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.
PSG was fined €60 million ($82 million at the time), later reduced to €20 million, and the club was required to field a Champions League squad for 2014-2015. 21 players instead of the usual 25 in the season.
UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who may try to outwit the financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to the club&#39;s owners.
A Qatari company can sponsor PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is deemed to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to count as official income.
That&#39;s what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority&#39;s support for PSG was inflated.
There has been talk that some of Neymar&#39;s PSG services could come through payments to the 2022 World Cup organizing committee from Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny Neymar could become a World Cup ambassador and say UEFA regulators could easily uncover such a maneuver.
PSG&#39;s previous penalties mean UEFA will be even more vigilant about any attempts to flout the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA has not proactively discussed Neymar&#39;s transfer with PSG.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG earned in 2015-2016. in the season of more than 10 million euros in profit with a turnover of approximately 542.4 million euros.
The figures for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG are hoping Neymar&#39;s arrival will bode well for sponsorship deals, merchandising and shirt sales.
The club expects an increase in turnover of at least 30 percent in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of football&#39;s biggest stars, tried to block Neymar&#39;s transfer, claiming that PSG were in breach of FFP.
&quot;This is a clear case of &#39;financial doping&#39; with the club and the country,&quot; La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, pointing out that PSG is mainly owned by Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports magnate, shares La Liga&#39;s stance that the state funds the club.
&quot;It is a consequence of ownership rights and it has completely changed the whole football landscape over the last 15 years,&quot; Wenger said on Thursday.
&quot;When the club is owned by the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, as the country may have other ways or other interests for such a big player to represent the country.&quot;
The low-cost Norwegian airline company Norwegian has a nice tradition of putting pictures of those who have pushed the boundaries in their field and been an inspiration to others on the plane&#39;s wing, writes trip.ee
Along with the expansion of Norwegian&#39;s operating geography, the circle of people who have earned a place on the plane&#39;s wedge has also expanded.
Among the selected personalities are, for example, Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (pictured) and Miguel de Cervantes.
However, in the near future, one of the planes will be decorated with a portrait of Freddie Mercury, the legendary singer of Queen.
50 years ago today: a hurricane-sized storm in Estonia that tore roofs and windows from houses.
The hurricane called the storm of the century, which raged on August 6 and 7, caused great damage especially to Läänemaa, Harjumaa and Raplamaa.
In North-West Estonia, the wind speed was over 30 m/s during those days.
My old man ran from one bending tree to another in the garden and tried to support them with his hands.
Everything was dark and rattling, like the end of the world.
In the background, the roofs were already flying off the houses, old lady Linda Kurova from Haapsalu recalled in an interview given to Eesti Loodus magazine in 2002.
Linda&#39;s husband saw the garden he had planted collapse.
But why are you supporting the trees with your hands, how can you withstand such a storm?
The sea came under the window, water splashed in from the windows,&quot; said Mrs. Linda, who lived on Kalda street in Haapsalu at the time.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway station platform had blown 20-30 meters away, Linda, like most of the Haapsalu children, only saw the next morning.
According to the locals, the trees behind Paralepa were lying on the ground, some completely lying down, some in half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm was going through the beautiful old trees with a rattle and crackle like a war.
Lääne-Virumaa was not particularly badly affected in the August storm of 1967 compared to Western Estonia, but the losses were also great there, the Virumaa Teataja wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padis Park were wiped out, but the parks in our area were also heavily damaged.
In Tallinn, the wind speed was measured up to 35 meters per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour.
At Merivälja in Tallinn, on the evening of August 6, a tiny tern had called out: &quot;Mother, mother!
The chickens are in the air and can&#39;t come down anymore!&quot;, Virumaa Teataja wrote.
The Põlli manor building in Viljandimaa was so destroyed during the storm that it was decided to demolish it later.
The constructions of the Türi ski jump hill did not withstand the August storm and were not restored later.
The Punane Täht newspaper wrote on August 12, 1967 that the cleaning of cities and settlements from fallen trees and their branches is progressing slowly, and residents could join in the cleaning work.
Cornfields were also badly damaged by the storm, and the newspaper declared that &quot;party organizations must act as encouragers and guides both in the clean-up work and in the harvest.&quot;
We can talk about hurricanes if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The gusty wind record in Estonia has stood since November 2, 1969, when the wind speed was measured at Ruhnu at 48 m/s.
On the island of Vaindloo, the measuring instrument broke, so the strong wind speed measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret of clean bathing beaches: cleaning at night and bad beach weather
Colder summer weather also means less cleaning effort at Tallinn&#39;s bathing beaches.
&quot;If the weather is good, people are on the beach, and if it&#39;s not, there are no people either,&quot; says the beach cleaner.
Seagulls are screeching on Stroom beach in northern Tallinn.
They are offered melodious competition by a low-revving tractor plowing stripes on the beach.
In fact, the latter sifts through the sand at a depth of seven centimeters, picking up sea debris and debris left behind by people: bottle caps, cigarette butts and others.
People still come to the beach whether the water is warm or not.
When the weather is nice, people are on the beach, and when it&#39;s not, there aren&#39;t any people either,&quot; says Aleksandr Usov, manager of the beach cleaning works of the private company Haabersti Haldus.
It is 6:30 a.m. and the beach is being cleaned up bitterly, because by eight o&#39;clock the square must be ready for people.
Usov has been at the post since four o&#39;clock.
Apart from Stroom, he also keeps an eye on Pirita, Harku lake, Kakumäe and Paljasaare&#39;s Pikakar beach.
Garbage volumes have decreased.
Years ago it was much more.
People can now already appreciate what is done for them&quot;, says Usov, who has been cleaning beaches for 15 years.
Before, when something new was put up, it was already broken the next day.
Now what is on the beach is kept.
The price of a clean beach
One of the biggest jobs on Estonian beaches is the cleaning of marine litter, or plow, washed ashore.
For example, at Pirita beach, 400,000 tons of it must be transported during the beach season.
&quot;This is an incredible amount,&quot; notes Usov.
Another large category is household waste, i.e. everything that people leave behind.
There are eight large garbage containers on the one-and-a-half-kilometer Stroom beach strip that need to be emptied three times a week.
So much garbage is generated.
However, the cooler summer weather has meant that there is a fifth less litter than usual.
The third type consists of abandoned things.
Mostly these are children&#39;s lives.
As this time&#39;s catch, Usov has scooped out a dozen model cars from the sand.
They will be waiting for their owners on the wooden path leading to the beach.
&quot;Usually more of them come out, but this is a normal catch&quot;. Usov already knows that soon he will find them again in the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to sink them in the sand again.
Garbage is scattered
Erika Scholler, representative of Haaberst&#39;s administrative services, admits that the tractor&#39;s sifting work disturbs the locals.
The noise, which lasts from late at night until early morning, disturbs the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
However, this work is impossible during the day.
The beach must be screened twice in one month.
&quot;If we don&#39;t, the district will fine us,&quot; notes Scholler.
But the goal is to get the Stroom beach under the international blue flag quality mark, just like Pirita, Pikakar and Pärnu.
&quot;Compared to Europe, there is much more work in Estonia to maintain the beaches&quot;, says Scholler.
We have more plow and stones and harder to sift sand.
However, there is less garbage on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
Hearing that there is talk of garbage on the beach, Martin, who lives near the Stroom beach, casually enters the conversation between the journalist and the cleaning workers, highlighting the current bottlenecks of the beach.
In the morning, there is an ugly picture everywhere.
The problem is with the birds and the bottle pickers who have pulled the garbage bags inside out,&quot; says Martin.
Although it is difficult to assume that people will be able to change their current behavior, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about the trash cans and, for example, put lids on them to at least prevent birds from exploring there.
Overall, however, Martin is happy with the development of Stroom Beach.
It can be seen that the city is taking care of it.
With children&#39;s playgrounds, lighted and newly asphalted roads, it has become more pleasant.
It used to be that roller skates could only be used on one road&quot;, notes Martin.
Treasure Hunter Finds in Stroom: Coins, Coins Only
40-year-old Dimitri, who combs the beach with a metal detector as a treasure hunter, has had to take advantage of the morning low tide.
He does not believe that he will find anything valuable today or in the future.
The sea gods are not generous enough for that.
&quot;I&#39;ve been working on it for a year and haven&#39;t found anything of value yet,&quot; says Dmitri.
As a hobby treasure hunter, Dmitri has some euro coins, bottle caps and also dangerous nails in his treasure bag, which he later throws in the trash.
There are usually still coins.
&quot;There is usually no gold, rings and the like,&quot; the treasure hunter states.
The Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at their previous levels as weak economic growth and easing inflation have dampened speculation about a hike.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish as tightening household incomes have put interest rates on hold.
Policymakers on the Bank&#39;s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members calling for a hike this month as sluggish economic growth has weakened support for a hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and 2018 to 1.6%, and warned that pressure on household incomes would remain as inflation is still expected to rise to close to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the bank also signaled that an increase in interest rates is necessary in the next few years to curb inflation caused by Brexit, and a higher-than-expected increase in borrowing costs may be necessary in the financial markets.
Members also voted in favor of a partial withdrawal of the mammoth economic stimulus package launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
The bank will end the Term Funding Scheme, which provides cheap funding to banks, in February, although it said it was now expected to offer £15bn more under the scheme, bringing the total to £115bn.
In the minutes of the decision regarding the rate, the bank says: &quot;In the MPC&#39;s medium forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain weak in the near future, as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption.&quot;
Regarding the rates, it was reiterated that &quot;some tightening of monetary policy&quot; is necessary to alleviate inflation, and to a &quot;somewhat larger&quot; extent than expected by the markets.
The exchange is currently predicting the first hike in the third quarter of next year and the second hike in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any jumps would be gradual and limited.
The bank&#39;s reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year are comparable to May forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast of 1.8 percent growth in 2018 remained unchanged.
Following this news, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to US$1.31 and 0.4% to EUR1.11.
The decision to make no changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures that have dampened rising hopes for a rise, with GDP rising to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
The bank says growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will pick up a bit towards the end of the year.
The Bank&#39;s latest inflation report gave households suffering from rising inflation and miserable pay rises little reason to cheer, saying things will get a little worse before they get better.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent a blow to incomes in the next few years, but a noticeable recovery of wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to the weak pound, the economy is also being stimulated by growing demand for British produce, which is partly offsetting lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were raised to 0.25% last August following a shock EU referendum that caused the pound to weaken sharply.
According to the bank, it will likely take four years to fully revive prices and the economy.
Ahead of the bank&#39;s latest decision, there was growing demand for a rate hike as inflation had increased pressure on hard-pressed households; in July, three policymakers called for a rate hike to 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, down from 2.9% in June, although the bank said this was expected and that it is expected to rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess growth compared to the 2 percent target was due entirely to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, head of mortgage brokers at Coreco, said: “Given the recent fall in exchange rates, the mortgage market looks set to become increasingly competitive again as lenders are eager for work and hope to end the year on a positive note.
The exchange looks particularly favorable for those whose current deals are coming to an end, as refinancing, often with no fees and at low rates, has become increasingly popular.&quot;
The NHS is about to prescribe the controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will be able to access a &quot;transformational&quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a High Court battle over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England has announced that NHS England is now making pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before intercourse that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk people by around 86%, to an estimated 10,000 people during an initial three-year clinical trial.
The NHS agreed to fund the clinical trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year that the NHS was able to pay for PrEP, despite the agency&#39;s own claims that the drug should be funded by local authorities instead.
NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens hailed the move, unveiled on Thursday, as a &quot;major new intervention&quot;, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a &quot;watershed moment&quot;.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start signing people up. More clinics will be added in October before the program is rolled out across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medication taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of contracting HIV.
Clinical trial results show that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that a person has enough of certain medicines in their body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or no later than two hours before intercourse.
Eligible candidates for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and people whose partners are infected with HIV and cannot receive treatment.
Clinics identify eligible people who agree to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people, and those whose HIV-infected partners are not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register their wish to participate at a local sexual health clinic participating in the program.
The program costs £10m and NHS England signed a contract to receive the drugs this week following an international tender.
The goal of the clinical trial is to assess PrEP&#39;s true potential by gathering clinical evidence about who the drug is for and how it is consumed and applied in the big picture.
Stevens said: &quot;This new large-scale intervention should complement and amplify the large-scale and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in the more than three-decade-long fight against one of humanity&#39;s biggest health problems.&quot;
Deborah Gold, CEO of NAT, said: “This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if correctly targeted at those who need it and are at risk, has the potential to transform England&#39;s HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV in England will have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and not dependent on partner negotiation through this NHS-funded clinical trial, improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.&quot;
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “The priority now is to ensure that the clinical trial across the country is launched quickly and that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial drug has been procured, we are on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.
Shadow Public Health Secretary Sharon Hodgson said: “The start of a PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and long overdue after months of delays and government foot-dragging.
The evidence shows just how much of a difference this drug can make to HIV prevention and ending the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial brings us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial is rolled out across the country as soon as possible to protect people exposed to HIV and bring us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society.&quot;
The price of electricity rose by 12% in Estonia, while it fell in Latvia and Lithuania.
In July, the difference in the next-day exchange price of electricity between the price regions of Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to 1.94 euros, compared to 7.71 euros in June this year, Elering announced.
The main reason for the price difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Swedish connection.
In Estonia, the average exchange price of electricity last month was 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour, and the price rose by 12 percent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price dropped by five percent to 36.27 euros per megawatt hour.
In Finland, the price was 34.17 euros, while the Nord Pool system price of the electricity exchange was 26.37 euros per megawatt hour.
Prices rose by 12 and seven percent, respectively.
Electricity moved between Estonia and Finland in 75 percent of the hours last month in the direction of Estonia and in 16 percent of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
In the remaining nine percent of the hours, there were no next-day trades between the two countries.
Between Estonia and Latvia, electricity flowed from Estonia to Latvia 99 percent of the time, and the full transmission capacity was in use in 73 percent of the hours.
According to the transactions that took place on the last trading day of July on the Nasdaq OMX market, the exchange price of electricity in August may be approximately 34 euros and in September 37 euros per megawatt hour.
The price of carbon dioxide, which affects the price of electricity production, rose last month, and transactions took place at a price of 5.04-5.47 euros per ton.
Living the high life - a mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have turned this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a keen property developer, swapped her large Knightsbridge home for a flat in Earls Court in 2014.
It&#39;s on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and it&#39;s a tribute to the new design that Joanne hasn&#39;t packed her bags and resold the flat.
&quot;Before that I was living in a much bigger place in Knightsbridge with my ex-partner,&quot; Joanne said.
“I was looking for something that was equivalent for the price I was offering.
I was shown this flat in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day.&quot;
Since the first visit, this 93 square meter apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
At first, it was a one-bedroom apartment with a complex layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom. Joanne wanted to add storage and a mezzanine to take advantage of the high ceilings.
&quot;I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands,&quot; he said.
He hired Erfan Azad of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck &amp; Shed to take advantage of the 3.8m high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development but a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling wasn&#39;t high enough to add two rooms on top of each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a mezzanine where you could stand up.
Erfan had to approach the matter creatively.
&quot;The metal structure is quite complex,&quot; he explains.
&quot;We had to rearrange the rooms so that they were on top of each other without having to bend over.
It wasn&#39;t just a case of building a platform, but we used a steel structure so that the height of both the upper and lower rooms was correct.&quot;
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two full height rooms on top of each other in the space with plenty of dramatic elements.
On the mezzanine floor, a vintage Retrouvius window with copper light opens up to a view of the glamorous living space below.
Golden furniture with a mirror surface, silver details and a retro Serge Mouille lamp emphasize the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, spaciousness and lightness.
Mirrors have been added at both ends of a short hallway to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the back wall with a mirror gives the impression of a window opening into another room.
At the entrance, a mirrored cabinet provides storage for all of Joanne&#39;s cutlery and glassware.
The ability to close the kitchen area when not in use adds charm to the living room, giving the impression of a more glamorous space.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, what is unique about this kitchen is that it is a garage-type roll-up door.
&quot;It took a bit of design effort,&quot; Erfan explains of the door made of veneered MDF with steel reinforcement.
&quot;It has a counterweight, so it slides very easily when you push it up.&quot;
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra square meters, an extra bedroom and a better apartment layout.
&quot;At the end of the day, the floor space is what you sell - or what adds value to the property,&quot; says Erfan.
&quot;A real estate agent walks into a room in an outdated form and does calculations based on floor area.&quot;
Here, they have managed to increase the floor area, while using high-quality materials that add luxury to the space.
&quot;Materials are what you touch and thus help create an emotional connection with the home,&quot; says Erfan.
“You don&#39;t fall in love with the electrical wiring in the wall.
It&#39;s important, but it doesn&#39;t make the heart sing.&quot;
It shows that good design and increased area can help turn a fairly ordinary apartment into something amazing.
In fact, they may even make you want to not leave, as Joanne did.
The main character, Dane Jensen, is a bounty hunter working in a Chicago skyscraper who competes with a colleague for a promotion.
Nothing matters but the amount of money earned, next to which all ethics are forgotten.
The man sees his wife and three children only in the early morning and late at night.
In the first half of the film, I catch myself thinking that this is the business world version of &quot;House of Cards&quot; - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler&#39;s speech style is similar.
As the film goes on, however, the camera element becomes less and less, and the moralizing intention of the filmmakers becomes more and more apparent.
The main character&#39;s son gets cancer as a life-changing experience.
Now you have to make a choice between work and family life.
A son who dreams of becoming an architect makes his father think about really important things such as faith, kindness, love... during his walks to the big buildings of Chicago, not even the disaster of the Twin Towers remains untouched.
After the third scene, where the son opens his father&#39;s eyes, one gets the feeling that the filmmakers have set the goal of making the audience cry, because even the hardest-hearted viewer can&#39;t hold back tears when seeing the suffering of a cute boy with cancer.
When his son falls into a coma and his situation seems hopeless, the father finally understands the morality of his work and does a good deed for an old man looking for work.
Now I make a bet with myself in my mind - if the movie has a happy ending, I will reward my perspicacity with a coffee after the movie, but if I&#39;m wrong, the screenwriter can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment there is a doubt that I will miss the coffee - when my husband calls Dane from the hospital and he rushes in slow motion along the corridor towards the ward.
However, the son has miraculously recovered, and even though his father has just lost his job, this also turns out to be positive, because now he has time to deal with the family.
I can feel good too - I can already predict the end of the American drama quite well!
To be honest, the film is well constructed, all the necessary elements are there.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and the moral is beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I guess this movie will bring in well.
Trump&#39;s new chief of staff plans to limit the president&#39;s media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really pull it off.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico reports that the White House&#39;s new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information, including news, to President Trump in the hope that it will keep the boss on a level playing field.
Here&#39;s an excerpt from reporter Josh Dawsey:
&quot;When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with senior officials on his first day on the job, he outlined a key problem in President Donald Trump&#39;s White House that he planned to address: bad information getting into the hands of the president.
Kelly told officials that information had to flow through him, either on paper or in meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he was given good information.&quot;
Kelly&#39;s diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media consumption.
President Trump&#39;s relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he&#39;s in the White House, his TV viewing habits haven&#39;t gone away.
&quot;When candidate Trump was upset about unfair media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also being fairly covered by influential outlets,&quot; former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico&#39;s Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that &quot;the key to controlling Trump&#39;s Twitter habits is making sure his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of eulogies, according to six former campaign staffers.&quot;
OK.
But the idea that Trump&#39;s Twitter habits were ever &quot;under control&quot; is ludicrous.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something the rest of us don&#39;t — that Trump&#39;s tweets would have been even more inflammatory without their intervention.
We&#39;ll probably never know about the tweets Trump didn&#39;t post.
If his assistants managed to save him from trouble a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from constantly creating controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing cliques, people are exclusively trying to advance their own interests by feeding Trump material that supports their worldview, but may not always be reliable.
Covering the whole story, Politico wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to feed the president information of questionable strategic value.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
&quot;Current and former Trump subordinates say Trump can react explosively to negative press, particularly damaging leaks, with an obsession with identifying their source.
That&#39;s what happened in late February, when someone gleefully gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, owned by internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, that accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the &quot;source of multiple leaks&quot; at the White House.
It doesn&#39;t matter that Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for taunting, or that he didn&#39;t offer any concrete evidence, or that he&#39;s made and retracted false accusations in the past.
Trump read the article and began asking subordinates about Walsh.&quot;
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Chief of Staff Rob Porter &quot;have been trying to establish a system for managing and documenting documents that reach Trump.&quot;
How did it work out?
Kelly tries to do the exact same thing three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his aides are still vying for influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly&#39;s mission very difficult.
Street musicians who came to the capital from abroad do not hesitate to get a permit to perform.
Many foreigners go to play music in the center of Tallinn.
Those with whom Õhtuleht spoke admitted that they play in the old town without the permission of the city government.
We were the first to find three street musicians near the gates of Viru, who had brought as many dogs with them.
It was clear that the musicians in dreadlocks and tattered clothes were backpackers who could use one shower to kill them.
Despite appearances, the only woman in the group played a song on the accordion with a cheerful rhythm, while a man next to her juggled three balls and beckoned passers-by to come closer.
The third man was sitting next to them on one of the backpacks and was calmly smoking a pipe he had made himself.
Their three dogs did not let the passing crowd bother them.
Noemi, who played the accordion, and Bob, who juggled balls, said that they play music in the streets for fun as well as for money.
The purpose of the group&#39;s performance was to collect ticket money for the ship sailing to Finland the same evening.
When asked if they asked permission from the city to play music in the old town, Noemi and Bob shook their heads.
First, we didn&#39;t know.
Second, we never stay in one city for more than a day or two, and usually the permits are for a month or something.
It doesn&#39;t make sense to pay for it,&quot; explained Bob.
When we got back to the gates of Viru about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were with the musicians and were chasing them away.
The group moved with backpacks and dogs to the intersection of Viru center to try their luck.
Three young Polish men also performed on Viru Street, one of whom played the violin, the second the clarinet, and the third even brought an electronic piano with him.
&quot;We are here to entertain people, to spread music and joy, and to earn money for fuel and living,&quot; explained trio pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that permission from the city government is required to perform.
&quot;Of course we don&#39;t have that,&quot; he said jokingly.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
Of course, if the police come, we will go elsewhere, but we have to try&quot;, he added.
Eesti Pank bought bonds for 149 million euros in July as part of the public sector asset purchase program of the euro area central banks, the bond portfolio of the central bank grew to 4.36 billion euros.
The Central Bank does not publish more detailed information about purchases.
The president of the Bank of Estonia, Hardo Hansson, has previously explained in response to the questioning of members of the Riigikogu that the asset purchase program of the Eurosystem central banks includes three different purchase programs: covered bonds of the financial sector, asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds from the market in order to encourage investors who sold bonds to invest their money elsewhere.
As a result of the purchases, the return on lower-risk assets falls and this motivates investors to take greater risks.
As a general rule, within the public sector bond purchase program, each central bank buys government bonds of its own country, bonds of other countries are not bought.
Since the Estonian state has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank makes so-called replacement purchases within the limits of the amount allocated to them.
Replacement purchases are also made by central banks in those countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchasing plan is limited.
According to Hansson, Eesti Pank generally buys bonds of European institutions, such as the bonds of the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank has been buying bonds as part of the asset purchase program since March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering&#39;s bonds were also acquired, but from June 2016, Eesti Pank no longer buys Elering&#39;s bonds.
Starting in June, the Central Bank of Finland will buy both Elering and Eesti Energia bonds on behalf of the euro area central banks.
Travelers ignore the ditch and return to the &quot;millionaires&#39; district&quot;
Some of the West Midlands&#39; wealthiest homeowners have been embroiled in yet another furious confrontation with determined travelers who have defied a ditch dug by the council to reclaim the field away from their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans in a field near Solihull Street, dubbed the wealthy &quot;millionaires&#39; quarter&quot;.
They have returned with an army of horses, children and lorries after only being kicked out in May, undeterred by a ditch dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a weak spot in the defense fence, squeezing their vehicles through the unblocked section that was left as a footpath.
Furious residents have slammed Solihull Council, saying the council is &quot;useless in dealing with the problem&quot;.
One anonymous resident said: “They moved there on Monday night after they were kicked out of Bentley Heath, where they were pelting passers-by with stones.
The council needs to be shamed into taking action because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were chased away and now they are back again.
There were more of them last night, probably more today.&quot;
He added: “Birmingham council know how to deal with this sort of thing by getting long barriers to protect their parks.
I live in Streetsbrook Road and I&#39;m not happy that I have to keep paying council tax when the council can&#39;t even stop something like this.&quot;
One local resident, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: &quot;It&#39;s ridiculous. We&#39;ve only just seen the last of these travelers leave and there&#39;s already another onslaught.
This time the number has increased and even a horse has been seen ruminating in the grass.&quot;
A Solihull Council representative said: &quot;We are aware that there is an unauthorized campsite on land near Streetsbrook Road and we are working with Solihull Police. We will take the necessary legal action to get them to move as soon as possible.
It will be of great help to gather evidence if as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
It helps create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them.&quot;
Among others, the Minister of Culture Indrek Saar will also visit the Weekend festival, who is happy that it has been possible to bring the real world&#39;s top names to Estonia.
When asked why the Weekend festival is so important for Estonians, Saar answers that it should be asked of all those who fully enjoy the three days of the festival.
However, he acknowledges that Pärnu has been visited by real experts in their field.
&quot;Looking at the level of artists that have been brought to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre are brought home - this does not often happen in our region&quot;, says the Minister of Culture.
But which artists performing at the festival speak for the Island the most?
I consider myself a relatively old man, and for old men like me, one of the most experienced artists is definitely Armin van Buuren, who performed last night.
According to his record spinning, all of us have spun our own feet at some point&quot;, he says.
However, he still mentions several names, for example Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian makers too: starting with NOËP and you can read a whole line of them.
In reality, this concentration of well-known names is very high,&quot; he says.

Audi is renewing up to 850,000 diesel vehicles amid criticism of automakers
A day before Audi&#39;s announcement, BMW said it was offering the software update to more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW&#39;s chairman said the company believes &quot;there are smarter options than driving restrictions,&quot; referring to European cities, including BMW&#39;s hometown of Munich, which have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
Neither company described these actions as recalls.
European automakers have been keen to promote diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet carbon emissions regulations.
However, nitrogen oxide from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of installing equipment to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles increases for car manufacturing companies, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German automakers are under intense scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s government has also been accused of pandering to powerful automakers and ignoring signs of trouble.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which kept quiet about the use of so-called cheating devices that made it possible to adjust emissions readings to meet regulations during car testing, but retracted under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics division of Audi&#39;s engine development department was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not immune from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany when authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade European emissions standards, widening an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
Audi&#39;s involvement in the investigation could be a big blow to Volkswagen, the luxury car maker generates a disproportionately large share of Volkswagen&#39;s profits.
European Union flags are purchased for 20,000 euros for Estonian schools.
The Ministry of Education plans to buy European Union flags for Estonian schools by September 1 to mark the presidency.
A total of 570 educational institutions will receive the European Union flag with dimensions of 105x158 centimeters.
The flags are intended for display indoors, they must be made indoors with high-quality printing technology, also with tunnel attachment, ERR&#39;s news portal reports.
The label on the flagpole reads: &quot;Gift to Estonian schools to mark Estonia&#39;s first presidency of the Council of the European Union.
According to the Ministry of Education, the estimated cost of 570 flags is 20,000 euros, i.e. one flag costs 35 euros.
The journalist&#39;s murder underscores the growing danger in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually gathers on Wednesdays to review plans to cover the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa, which is being sown by organized crime, corrupt officials and relentless drug wars.
But today, in the shadow of a personal tragedy, they have gathered to discuss their own safety.
They are told that it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss which seems safer: bringing the children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: &quot;enemies,&quot; &quot;neutrals,&quot; &quot;allies.&quot;
They ask reporters to provide names for each column—no proof needed, just impressions and gut feelings.
Drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of being in the employ of the government or cartels - a whole list of bad guys who make it dangerous to cover the chaos in Mexico.
There is no respite from the violence, and the more bodies pile up across the country, the greater the number of journalists - according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, there have been at least 25 since the inauguration of President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012. 589 journalists are under national protection after attacks and threats and at least seven journalists in seven states have been killed so far this year.
The latest casualties include their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
&quot;The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,&quot; Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence can be felt everywhere - a large picture of Valdez showing the middle finger with the words &quot;Justice&quot; hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building, and two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts depicting him smiling with glasses face or his characteristic panama hat.
The meeting comes less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate state prosecutor&#39;s office was created in 2010 to handle cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been prosecuted.
As is the case with most of the annual drug-trafficking and organized crime murders, which number in the thousands, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
The Riodoce editorial continues to cover the violence in Sinaloa, though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without data and justice for the killers, Ibarra said, the security meeting is of little use.
&quot;It&#39;s very silly to waste your time in this meeting,&quot; he says.
&quot;Until the reason is known, you distrust everyone.&quot;
Valdez left Riodoce&#39;s office in Culiacan, the state capital, on the morning of May 15.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before two men stopped him in a red Toyota Corolla. He was forced out of the car and shot 12 times. This is presumably because of the newspaper&#39;s name, which translates as &quot;twelfth river&quot;.
The gunman drove off in Valdez&#39;s car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He is survived by his wife and two adult children.
Rumors run wild in Culiacan.
But there is mostly silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since Guzman&#39;s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country&#39;s bloodiest battlegrounds as rival cliques battle to fill the power vacuum.
It doesn&#39;t matter that a person or several are gunned down every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the graveyard is teeming with lavishly decorated double mausoleums of drug lords larger than the homes of many living.
Let&#39;s forget for a moment that peacetime refers to a single cartel running a maritime state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this, and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his job, Riodoce co-founder and manager Ismail Bojorquez, 60, feels immense guilt that he failed to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes contributed to the killing.
The first was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the frontman of the warring cartel clique that rivals Guzman&#39;s sons.
The piece must have angered the boys - suspected gang members bought up all the copies of the publication as soon as they hit the newsstands.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after another newsroom covering the same story was raided.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would be around forever.
He was working as a veteran reporter for the Noroeste newspaper in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling $50 units.
Bojorquez said that in Sinaloa &quot;it was impossible to do journalism without touching the drug problem.&quot;
Over time, the newspaper gained recognition for its bold and honest coverage, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish robust research without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by print, where they could read stories that no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its coverage of Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists (AKK) for his courage in following the Mexican drug story wherever it leads.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
&quot;I want to live on,&quot; he said when accepting the AKK award.
In an interview with Rompeviento TV last October, he said that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
&quot;You have to accept the task that comes with being a journalist - the other option is to play dumb.
I don&#39;t want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn&#39;t tell what was going on.&quot;
The Riodoce collective misses Valdez, the joker who snarled like a sailor, the friend who kindly shared hugs and advice, the teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went to the El Guayabo bar across the street from the office and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if his routine love proved fatal for him.
His death has also made them question themselves, how to do their job best and stay alive.
&quot;They don&#39;t like you messing with their women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs.&quot;
&quot;These things were not to be touched,&quot; Bojorquez said.
The result is strong self-censorship and self-preservation even in the best of times.
Trusting your instincts.
If something smells fishy, stay away.
According to Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, the problem is that &quot;the sense of smell can be deceived... and that&#39;s what happened with Javier.&quot;
He and others say the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they don&#39;t in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
Cell phones were suddenly not allowed in the room where Riodoce employees met for security training; a few days before that, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two policemen sought relief from the 40-degree heat in the shade of a tree.
The government assigned them to guard Riodoce&#39;s office, located in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood in Culiacan.
Some reporters half-jokingly wondered if these police officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself has labeled as untrustworthy.
Several months have passed since reporters have traveled to the mountainous countryside where control is de facto in the hands of drug gangs.
This week&#39;s edition of Riodoce covered three main stories.
One of them was the murder of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez&#39;s brother in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor&#39;s home town.
And one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor&#39;s office, was robbed by a group of people.
There was no official announcement of who was robbed or how it happened, so caution had to be taken when it came time to write what everyone in town knows - the restaurant is a hot spot for drug dealers and authorities alike.
The reporter learned from public records that the restaurant is registered in the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics for almost the entire last century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile court cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at the same location, including how the son of Guzman, nicknamed El Chapo, escaped a military raid.
Just a few months ago, readers would have turned to Valdez&#39;s column for the best sources of kidnapping information.
&quot;Before, we would have already known what happened,&quot; said the 46-year-old Villarreal, whose diminutive frame has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
&quot;Now all channels of communication with our sources have been cut off.&quot;
Valdez&#39;s office has become a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and the editorial staff has become something they never expected—activists for the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and headed to the local prosecutor&#39;s office the next morning to protest yet another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacán three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body has been found and officials say it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become more vocal, scrawling the phrase &quot;SOS press&quot; on sidewalks and buildings as an organized protest.
That day, Chief Bojorquez is away in Washington, D.C., trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa a day after Valdez&#39;s death, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked to be diverted from covering government activities, worried that the anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were &quot;confined&quot; by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.
In his latest book &quot;Drug Journalism&quot;, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also at the behest of politicians and security forces, who are allied with organized crime.
Media monitoring group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and government officials.
&quot;In Mexico, you die because they want to silence you,&quot; Ramirez said.
The murders are obviously chilling.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a note, believed to have been signed by the Los Zetas cartel: &quot;I&#39;m here for my reporting.&quot;
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to his severed head.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others let it go, as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their editor in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a front-page editorial, &quot;What do you want from us?&quot;.
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It is a nerve-wracking decision.
It is hard to find work in exile and they still have to pick the streets to avoid danger.
And sometimes they are pursued, as is believed to have happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered along with four women in a Mexico City apartment in 2015, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay put and continue to work have to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that covering the drug business scares him.
&quot;Mexico is on its way to hell, and that&#39;s why I became a reporter,&quot; he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, with the latest issue already locked, Riodoce&#39;s editors were sitting on the sidewalk outside the office sipping beer when suddenly everyone&#39;s phones started vibrating.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people were confirmed dead in the exchange of fire between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by several messages left by cartels found in the region.
From the side of the sidewalk, reporters posted the news on the Riodoce website using their cell phones.
The next day&#39;s front cover needed a change.
Sirens blared by - another exchange of fire in the area.
Bojorquez peered at the officers on duty to see if they were alert.
If they were afraid, they didn&#39;t show it in the least.
Beneath a massive portrait of the newspaper&#39;s fallen founder, with his middle finger visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce workers followed in his footsteps.
&quot;How could you even think about closure,&quot; Bojorquez said, &quot;when on the same day Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send him out into the streets to report?&quot;
The dinosaur used protective color to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a rather scary one.
Scientists have now revealed the first findings of an incredible rhinoceros-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner that is so well preserved that experts have described it as the &quot;Mona Lisa of dinosaurs&quot;.
In fact, it is so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that his scaled skin was a reddish-brown color and that he had had a somewhat &quot;complicated&quot; past.
A report in the journal Current Biology described the creature as &quot;the best-preserved pangolins ever found&quot; and &quot;one of the finest dinosaur specimens in the world&quot;.
The fossil is a new species of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredible preservation has amazed researchers, who describe it as &quot;truly remarkable&quot;.
This scaly herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its type ever found, according to National Geographic magazine.
It was found on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk while mining at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that didn&#39;t resemble the surrounding rock and decided to investigate further.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The next six years were spent working to excavate the animal from the 2,500-pound (1,100-kilogram) piece of land.
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to be released to the public.
&quot;If you squint a little, you can almost believe it&#39;s sleeping,&quot; said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is on display.
&quot;It will go down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.&quot;
Examining its skin, the researchers found that this herbivore, although covered in scales and resembling a walking tank, was probably significantly threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
This heavily armored dinosaur used red and white protective coloring to hide from predators and employed a camouflage technique called counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
According to experts, this allowed the dinosaur to better blend into its surroundings and avoid enemies, as larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt it.
This 110-million-year-old creature from the nodosaur family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Scientists have now studied the creature and named it Borealopelta after Mark Mitchell Museum lab technician Mark Mitchell, who was part of the team that spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering the animal.
Thanks to the specimen&#39;s amazing preservation, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of researchers were able to document the shape and size of the scales on the animal&#39;s body.
They discovered counter-eclipsing, a common defense method in the animal kingdom that means the top half of the creature was darker than the bottom.
Although counter-eclipsing is common, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealopelta is much larger than the counter-eclipsing animals living today.
This suggests that the dinosaur was hunted actively enough by other carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored hiding over confrontation as a survival tactic.
However, most modern animals that use counter-shadowing - such as deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that Nodosaurus had to really struggle to survive.
&quot;The vigorous hunting of an enormously large and heavily armored dinosaur shows just how dangerous Cretaceous dinosaur predators could have been,&quot; Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur&#39;s skin was reddish brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including the preserved contents of its gut to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river when it died, thus reaching the sea with the current, where it sank back to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely extended much further inland than they do today.
&quot;This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin, while also remaining three-dimensional, preserving the animal&#39;s original shape,&quot; Brown said.
&quot;As a result, the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the Cretaceous.
You don&#39;t have to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it - it&#39;s enough to squint your eyes and it looks like he&#39;s sleeping.&quot;
The Cretaceous period was a time when huge bipedal carnivorous dinosaurs - theropods - roamed the Earth.
Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its fearsome predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a monster that was 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and weighed six tons.
The researchers, whose recent findings are published in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed into the sea after death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk while mining at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and scales, and is complete from snout to hips.
These creatures averaged 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Two 20-inch spikes protruded from its shoulders.
Scientists believe this scaled herbivore roamed what is now western Canada until a flooded river washed it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur&#39;s underwater burial helped to preserve its scales in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the ridged plates of armor along the dinosaur&#39;s skull are still covered by remnants of skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic magazine: “This degree of preservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
Fossilized remains of skin still cover the humped scales on the animal&#39;s skull.
The right front leg is lying next to him, with five toes extended upwards.
I can count the scales on his soles.&quot;
How one activist found the answer to the question &quot;Whose streets?&quot;
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell got a complete shock.
Just a day after traveling to New York, it sat in St. Louis resident on his bed in a room rented through Airbnb, scrolling through Facebook on his phone.
He came across a post from his former schoolmate.
It read: &quot;An 18-year-old has just been killed by the police and is still lying in the street.&quot;
Confused as to why no one else had posted this information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The posts of the user with the handle @TheePharoah were repeatedly reshared on his timeline.
St. Louis-area rapper live-tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
She posted a picture of Brown&#39;s lifeless body lying in the street, where it remained for four hours.
&quot;This is crazy,&quot; Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He put his phone away, only to see the tweets again later in the evening, this time announcing a gathering of people on Canfield Drive.
Photos were shared of police tape and people screaming, and a man claiming to be Brown&#39;s father holding a sign reading &quot;Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!&quot;.
He watched a live feed of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer, he said, pointed a gun and yelled, &quot;I&#39;m going to kill all of you ... animals.&quot;
Ferrell remembers thinking, &quot;This is unusual.&quot;
&quot;This is not the kind of murder we are used to and what we would call typical.&quot;
I felt a shiver of fear at that moment.
I was angry and I cried.&quot;
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., he went to his father&#39;s house to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided that the two of them would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the focus of the new documentary Whose Streets? (&quot;Whose streets?&quot;), which premieres in theaters on August 11.
It&#39;s a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and toughness, from the perspective of the people who live in this community and who filled the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell and his daughter - wearing a floral dress and matching crown - drove to Ferguson, they again talked about a topic that had come up many times before that morning - the experience and living conditions of black people.
&quot;Remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for their rights?&quot; he recalls asking himself.
&quot;We&#39;re going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that&#39;s not right.&quot;
&quot;I couldn&#39;t not take him,&quot; Ferrell said later.
“What is happening now is… the culmination of what happened in the past.
He must know it and see it and grow in the midst of it.
He needs to learn about activism and organizing while also learning about the different layers of black experience and living conditions and what we need to do to be free and to liberate ourselves.
Even if I manage to raise her without personally experiencing blatant racism, she will be no different than any other black girl.
I feel I would be doing him a disservice if I protected him from this world.&quot;
The first stop they made when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, across the street from the police station, which had become a kind of campground where activists waited for news about police officer Darren Wilson, who was ultimately not charged.
There, Ferrell and his daughter teamed up with a local business owner who prepared lunches.
They assembled food bags and helped distribute them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new kind of activism was slowly taking shape.
&quot;My activism completely changed after August 9,&quot; he said, noting that when he was at the Missouri-St. A student at Louis University, she was president of the Minority Nursing Student Association and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.
&quot;I had no organizing experience.
It all just blew up.&quot;
Weeks later, Ferrell met one of the film&#39;s co-directors, Sabaah Folayan, during an evening performance.
Folayan said he and cinematographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was happening.
The question that popped into Ferrell&#39;s mind was, &quot;Are you trying to document what&#39;s going on or find a story that can be exploited?&quot;
Such skepticism was the result of countless cases of people - often white - coming into a community and trying to profit from its pain and resilience.
Folayan explained in a recent interview, &quot;We had heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson were not being heard, and we wanted to do it differently.&quot;
Folayan had already teamed up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism regarding death row inmates.
His involvement made the project attractive to Ferrell and six other locals, who were featured in the movie &quot;Whose Streets?&quot; team followed for years after Brown was shot.
&quot;In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, we speak for ourselves,&quot; Davis said.
&quot;It was important to me how these people are portrayed, because that&#39;s how I&#39;m portrayed too.&quot;
Although the intention was not to focus on Ferrell&#39;s experience - to show that the movement is not about &quot;a savior leader, but about a community coming together&quot;, as Folayan put it - he became the film&#39;s most open character.
As a result, &quot;Whose Streets?&quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell&#39;s life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
&quot;I felt like I was naked,&quot; Ferrell said, laughing about the first time he saw the finished piece.
&quot;But I realized there&#39;s a certain vulnerability that comes with doing this work and humanizing black people.&quot;
Moreover, Ferrell&#39;s story underscores and re-centers the role of the black gay woman in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement that coined the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media following the 2012 killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin are gay.
“Black gay women in leadership roles have sustained the movement overall,” Ferrell said, “and that&#39;s precisely because we have to constantly fight on multiple fronts.
Black gay women have to bear the whole burden.&quot;
Folayan agreed, noting that &quot;the movement is really being kept alive by black women, and many of them are black gay women.&quot;
He also insists that &quot;it&#39;s not an equal opportunity type of thing&quot; - Ferrell was not chosen to be the focus of the film because of his identity.
&quot;He was a person who exuded the right energy,&quot; he said.
&quot;But it&#39;s not a coincidence that she was right on the front line, because as a black gay woman living in these hubs, there&#39;s a lot at stake.
You can feel his energy through the screen.&quot;
Meanwhile, news cameras are long gone from Ferguson, but racial ties between the community and the police remain fragile.
Ferrell&#39;s suspended sentence for blocking a road during the demonstration will last another 2.5 years.
He describes the socio-political climate in the region he calls home as simply &quot;tohuvaboh&quot;.
Still, he still values the mantra he&#39;s etched into his memory since he took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
&quot;It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.&quot;
7 tricks to get over a hangover after a Weekend party
After a party full of booze, some of the tougher guys find that what&#39;s bad is good.
Or based on the saying &quot;avoid a hangover, stay drunk&quot;.
But this is only an inevitable postponement and a serious blow to health.
What can you do to feel better in the morning after today&#39;s and tomorrow&#39;s weekend party - or other party - and get over the hangover as painlessly as possible?
Drink water.
On and off alcohol, after a big party in the morning ... or even instead of alcohol if possible.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid when drinking alcohol, it must be regained somehow.
Along with water, minerals are also washed out of the body, so it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after snacking, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or only slightly gassed.
Go for a walk.
It&#39;s definitely not worth going to grandma&#39;s house to chop wood with a hangover - it could turn out to be a fatal wrong decision.
But a light walk helps the body to remember again what it feels like to be alive.
Lying in a tent and sleeping it off is a more time-consuming way to recover.
Re-energize the body slowly and carefully.
If you&#39;re already throwing up from yesterday&#39;s binge, it&#39;s definitely not worth trying to load a big fatty steak into your stomach.
Start, for example, with fresh juice, the fruit sugars contained in it will slowly invigorate your body.
If your health is already suffering around lunch, you could try, for example, broth.
And a little later the back.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic rids your body of every last bit of water.
As already said: water and juice are your friends.
Don&#39;t rely on painkillers.
If you take a painkiller in the evening to prevent a hangover, your liver has to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and thus loses performance.
In this way, you will damage your liver even more, and the hangovers will be worse in the future.
Plus, the painkiller doesn&#39;t stay in the body very long anyway.
If you take a pain reliever in the morning, don&#39;t do it on an empty stomach - it will irritate your already upset stomach.
Or if you don&#39;t have a partner, get along well with yourself.
It has about the same effect as walking, but walking does not make you orgasm.
However, avoid too active pace and crazy poses - during a hangover, physical effort should be moderate.
Make a joke.
Talk nonsense with friends-fellow-sufferers, do simple nonsense and laugh in a friendly manner both at yourself and at the (suffering) of others.
Jokes and laughter may not get rid of the hangover, but they certainly make it more fun to endure the aftermath.
Once the hangover goes away anyway!
A Northwestern professor and an Oxford University employee are wanted on suspicion of murder
Police say a nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who have become suspects after the body of a man with fatal stab wounds was found in a luxury Chicago apartment.
No-bail warrants were issued Monday for the arrests of Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, on charges of first-degree murder in connection with the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to Cook County court records.
Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed repeatedly, according to documents.
The body was discovered on July 27, according to an alert issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community.
The police received a phone call and when they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment building, they found the victim with several stab wounds on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and investigators are treating the stabbing as a homicide while police are actively searching for two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university&#39;s vice president for public affairs, said in an emailed statement that Lathem has now been temporarily suspended and banned from Northwestern University campuses.
&quot;This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with investigators,&quot; Cubbage said.
Warren is a Senior Assistant in the Department of Finance at the University of Oxford.
A representative of the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: &quot;We have been in contact with British police and are prepared to assist US investigative authorities in any way we can.&quot;
The statement also said Warren&#39;s colleagues are shocked and want her to turn herself in.
Anthony Guglielmi, chief of communications for the Chicago Police Department, urges suspects to turn themselves in to authorities.
&quot;The police have an idea where they are, but we are working more and more intensively to determine the exact location,&quot; Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, local, state and national authorities are assisting in the search for the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building who had just received a cryptic tip that something had happened in apartment #1008.
According to the police description, it was a terrible scene.
According to Guglielmi, it is not clear whether the event itself also took place on July 27.
He said security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren were in the building.
&quot;We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,&quot; Guglielmi added.
Grand Plaza management sent a letter to residents: &quot;Police are currently working to determine the chronology of events and the background of the victim and are investigating various motives, including the possibility that it was a family dispute.&quot;
Startups that can help your business avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but surveys were fruitless.
The answers were often vague, unhelpful or, even worse, misleading.
And even when he promised anonymity, some employees didn&#39;t trust the process.
&quot;The system just wasn&#39;t consistent and objective,&quot; said Errett, who runs Madison Reed, a San Francisco-based hair care e-commerce company with 75 employees.
So he called in outsiders for help.
A new breed of HR startups is emerging to help companies figure out what their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software specifically designed to measure employee engagement, they enable companies to conduct snap surveys, target specific teams and demographics, provide employee anonymity and a grievance hotline, and in some cases allow native speakers to bypass C-level executives and reach out to directly to the board.
&quot;Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit for health tracking, but where is Fitbit for your business?&quot; asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Glint, a Redwood City startup that uses software analytics tools for companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett says that in the three years he&#39;s been using Glint, he&#39;s gained a much better understanding of what his employees are thinking and feeling.
In addition to ad hoc surveys and surveys of specific teams, it provides a company heat map that provides insight into which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing him to identify the reasons.
Companies are beginning to realize they need to stay on top of their work culture to avoid becoming the next Uber, which has been embroiled in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing a harassing environment where those who dared to speak out were punished.
For startups like Glint, the desire to have insight is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to financial technology statistics website Let&#39;s Talk Payments.
Convercent, a Denver, Colorado-based startup that helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, has seen an uptick in interest and activity this year amid Uber&#39;s dubious reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a customer.
Like Glintki, Convercent lets companies send customized impulse surveys, collect confidential responses in real-time, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous message line that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
And when the CEO is involved, complaints go directly to the board.
&quot;Public opinion has been usurped by regulators,&quot; said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to be mistreating its employees or behaving unethically, the company could face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, walkouts and lawsuits, even if regulators don&#39;t get involved.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employee awareness of policies and procedures and provide an easy way to communicate with corporate headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, they had to find a phone number or email address at corporate headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope it would be taken seriously.
It was often a frustrating and awkward process, said Ruby Tuesday general counsel James Vitrano, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
However, now that the company uses Convercent, issues such as discrimination, harassment or unfair pay practices that previously did not reach managers operating in offices in other cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly.
&quot;I&#39;m able to get closer to the holistic 360-degree experience of employees,&quot; said Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday&#39;s risk management group.
&quot;And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees.&quot;
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behavior, values and employee engagement much more seriously in 2002, after the auditing firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations related to the Enron scandal.
But it wasn&#39;t until &quot;social media came of age&quot; that companies realized they couldn&#39;t stop their dirty laundry from being aired publicly online.
&quot;Before using technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy,&quot; he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies a periodic fee for using their products.
It&#39;s a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors who have backed both startups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the capital raised to $47 million.
Glint received a $10 million investment from Bessemer Venture Partners in November, bringing the company&#39;s total funding to $60 million.
Such investments do not come as a surprise when you consider the interconnectedness of companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that today&#39;s workers expect more from the workplace than ever before.
In highly competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are mere table stakes.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued and that they are devoting their time to a company with a positive mission.
&quot;When people are happy at a company, feel listened to and that the work they do is rewarding, they are more committed to the company&#39;s success,&quot; said Nina McQueen, vice president of overall benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn income when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it&#39;s no wonder they&#39;re gaining traction.
Having data on employee engagement is important, according to work culture experts.
But that data is useless if the company&#39;s watchdogs don&#39;t act on it.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can create expectations that changes are coming.
And if change doesn&#39;t happen fast enough or not at all, it can lead to frustration and reduced employee engagement.
&quot;If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you need to be prepared for 4,000 conversations,&quot; said Russell Raath, president of consulting and business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
&quot;Because if you don&#39;t get things done, employees will think, &#39;Did you actually listen to me?&#39;
do you care
And if you don&#39;t care, why should I?&#39;&#39;
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action the same day the problem is reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from employees frustrated with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize several teams in the company and provide communication training to address the issues.
However, Ruby Tuesdays collects new employee data and hopes that, in the long run, it will lead to longer-term employee engagement in an industry known for its high labor turnover.
&quot;If you&#39;re not committed to transparency, you&#39;re going to lose people,&quot; Vitrano said.
“And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses.&quot;
The bright star of the Eurozone is the Baltics: incomes are growing rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, writes Bloomberg, referring to the report of the European Central Bank.
According to the data of the Central Bank, since 1999, the total economic output per person in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
Behind the success is a low debt burden, fast-improving institutions and business- and free-market-friendly policies.
&quot;The Baltic states, together with Slovakia, are among the few countries in the euro area where real GDP per person in terms of purchasing power has significantly approached the EU average,&quot; the central bank announced.
Although the goal is for the economy&#39;s gross output per person to equal that of richer Western Europe, in 2015 the Baltic economies&#39; gross output per capita was only 2/3 of the average of the 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led Balts to look for better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic States in a positive light and the economy is also growing this year, local residents are not at all enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvian and Lithuanian residents assessed that their economies are doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, slightly less than half of the respondents thought this about the economies of their countries.
The NCAA&#39;s decision to cancel twice-a-day practices will make the days long for the Bruins
It&#39;s almost 11 p.m. when a group of UCLA football players pause to chat at the edge of the team&#39;s new practice field on campus.
Some of them have stripped off their shirts, revealing sweaty backs from the exertions of their first day of training camp.
For much of the team, these idle minutes provide a midday break.
After a three-hour practice, players in summer courses head back to the dorms to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Soccer Center for meetings at 6:30 the next morning.
&quot;The next three days are going to be a real test for them,&quot; Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA&#39;s decision to cancel twice-a-day practices to reduce the workload on players has actually made their days longer - at least until they get to the end of final exams on Friday.
For that reason, UCLA&#39;s first three practices were scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to fit into the players&#39; already busy schedules.
The move from two practices a day means more one-practice days -- the start of Bruins training camp was moved up nearly a week from last season and, for the first time in Mora&#39;s six seasons in Westwood, practices will be held during summer classes.
They have 18 practices scheduled through Aug. 20 before official preparation begins for the opener against Texas A&amp;M in September.
Mora says he&#39;s in favor of the NCAA rule change, even though it adds another agenda item to the players&#39; busy schedules.
&quot;They have a huge load for three or four days and it&#39;s a serious challenge,&quot; Mora said.
&quot;And they&#39;re breaking through this ordeal; they&#39;re working hard, they&#39;re great young people.
I believe that when Saturday comes and we have more time, it will be really nice.&quot;
Once camp is over, UCLA will shut down practice, no easy task given the clear view of their fields from a nearby parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been hit by footballs that have escaped the protective netting surrounding the goalposts.
Starting this weekend, the hotel will be occupied by Bruins players, but Mora admitted there could be problems with available rooms during the season.
&quot;We are implementing security measures,&quot; Mora said.
&quot;It&#39;s a real concern and it&#39;s not at all an exaggeration to think that people can rent a room and film training from there.
If you have a recording of your workout, you can make a pretty good deal out of it.
But we use a security team there and in the 8th parking lot.
We do our best using what we have.
I try not to worry too much about it.
We have a plan in place.&quot;
The Savisaare-Ivanova election alliance born as a revenge for the Central Party, Meie Tallinn created by joining the forces of Kristiina Ojulandi, expelled from the Reform Party, and Maria Kaljuste, who was forced to leave EKRE, and the businessmen&#39;s election alliance Tegus Tallinn, which hopes to show the party members what it is, - it seems that the electoral alliances created on the initiative that got burned in party politics will participate in this year&#39;s local elections at least as many as political parties.
However, the chicks will be counted in the fall, and the key question will be whether there are enough disillusioned voters for all of them.
Who stays with Savisaari?
How small Edgar Savisaare&#39;s support base has shrunk can be guessed from the events organized in honor of his electoral alliance.
One Riigikogu member, some former and current members of the center party and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral alliance?
And can the reason why some loyal supporters and friends of Savisaare abstain from running in Tallinn be that the &quot;Savisaare list&quot; of the rejecters, headed by corrupt persons and suspects of corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
A music video for a Russian-language pop song filmed on the roof of the district administration, in which the elder of the Lasnamäe district participates; and a rudimentary computer game in every sense, in which the main character, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, has to avoid puddles and squirrels on the road while riding a bike - is this how the Central Party is trying to get the votes of 16- and 17-year-old voters who are allowed to go to the ballot boxes for the first time?
We will have to wait to see what the other political parties think about the youth-friendly election campaign.
If, from the beginning of August, the viewer of Kanal 2 or TV3 sees a black square instead of an entertainment program, they have two choices: accept that in the future they will only watch ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinna TV and the English-language France24 channels, or give up the ten channels every month to a TV operator.
There are probably also those who at first are openly happy about the ad-free TV experience, but in the end they still pay for the TV picture and ads, albeit reluctantly.
Disturbing music, noisy crowds and trash left on the streets are unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don&#39;t want to be a part of the fun yourself, it&#39;s worth going to explore your homeland instead of having a headache at home - and leave a place to sleep for the festival guests for a hefty sum.
Washington changes green card rules
Media outlets are quoting President Donald Trump as saying that a new US immigration plan is in the works that will change the green card rules.
The plan calls for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 people a year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans and are supported by the president.
The draft law will be debated in the two houses of the Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars in taxpayer money by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and will replace the current program.
The new application process gives an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the financial means to support themselves and the skills to benefit our economy,&quot; Trump said, according to US media outlets.
The young people of the Siberian Seto move to the city, the pensioners move back to the countryside.
Yevseyev&#39;s Anatoli continues the tradition of the famous Seto gold miners along the Maana River.
He works 140 kilometers from home on the Kuvai, a tributary of Maana, as a driver in a gold mine.
It&#39;s hard work: 12 hours of work for two months straight with no days off, and then only ten days at home and back again.
Anatoli has seen gold only once during the three years he worked at Artelli.
&quot;There is a strict order: when going in, they check thoroughly to make sure that you don&#39;t bring vodka, and when you go out, that you don&#39;t take gold with you,&quot; says Anatoli.
Mare Piho talking to local Seto Jaan in Haida village, who has told her a lot about her family&#39;s memories in Siberia.
The still-preserved archaic culture of the Siberian Setos will also influence the Setos at home, because it is simply so stunning, thinks Piho Mare, who studied the distant Setos the most thoroughly.
This year marks 30 years since his first research trip to Siberia.
During this time, he has been there 14 times and lived there for a total of one year.
How many settlers still migrated to Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to get land here?
This is an open question.
I say 8000.
I calculated it based on the stories of the Siberian Seto men, who have also thought about it themselves.
It is difficult to say exactly, because at that time up to 30 people could come in one group, but only a man was given a passport.
A passport was given to only one, but he had children, sisters and other female relatives with him.
Look how big this territory was here!
It was several times larger than the historical Setomaa.
After all, it was necessary to educate, manage in some way.
The Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed, because here they got into areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (log rafting), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Petersburg, many Setos later went to work in the classified city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (where the Soviets built a uranium enrichment plant - JP) when it was formed.
Were the Setos the majority of the population in this area at the time?
Yes, they lived compactly.
In addition, the tradition of marrying each other and having many children was preserved for a long time.
Seven or eight children in a family was common.
How much did the culture of the Siberian Setos differ and differ from that of the Setos of the motherland?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought a lot of traditional clothes.
They also made (folk clothes) themselves, but they always distinguished between what was brought and what was made here.
The climate change strongly affected the traditional clothing of the Setos, because it is colder here.
Foods changed.
For example, in Setomaa the meat was salted, but here it was simply frozen.
Where are the Siberian Seto villages located and what is the life like there? / graphics: Alari Paluots
The connection with the motherland was spiritually strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now it will give Setumaa back there, it will influence them.
Those girls who have lived here in families have listened to amazing stories.
Piho refers to the people of the Estonian Seto delegation, who came to Haida village at the beginning of July for the Seto Kingdom Day and lived in homes for four days - JP
What&#39;s left here is stunning.
&quot;It is extremely easy to come and go to Tapa, because the city has a great location: at a railway hub and at the crossroads of highways,&quot; says Reigo Tamm, an opera soloist from Tapa.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sports and cultural places, and pizza can be found at every corner.
Tapa is a top-top city!
There is a small island by the river Valgejõgi, which runs through the city, where the people of Tapala used to celebrate midsummer.
&quot;You can&#39;t see this beautiful place from the train window&quot;, says Reigo.
Those who are not afraid of cold water can swim in the river, because the river is full of springs.
I&#39;ve been swimming there, I can do it!
You can have a picnic on the bank of the river and just be romantic - you can watch the river flow and think about life ahead and behind.
I have also been there for a walk with my brides.
Apart from everything else, the opera soloist Tamm has been practicing his arias on the river bank between three bridges: &quot;Because this place is on the edge of the city, no one might come to me when I hum my songs&quot;.
&quot;Männikumäe offers a wonderful view of Tapa, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in the winter, and currently, for example, play disc golf - the golf course has been made, and discs can be rented from the sports center,&quot; says Reigo.
Of course, the old pros go there with their discs, but I haven&#39;t gotten to play there yet.
You should probably invite your colleague Rasmus Kull Tapa to visit, because he is an experienced disc golf player and he has the discs.
Only he will lend it to me!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable during the childhood of the current opera soloist.
At least during ski lessons.
There are many tears, disappointments and victories in my sports life left on this mountain.
Not to mention broken sleds and skis.
&quot;The whole city center is currently full of construction works, all of it is changing beyond recognition&quot;, praises Reigo.
Tapa&#39;s old and tired station building is, however, a very attractive place where summer plays are played.
I am glad that in 2012 the director of RAAAM, Märt Meos, accepted my idea and came to do a summer theater in Vaksas with his theater.
Although this year&#39;s theater season with &quot;Aleksei Karenin&quot; has just ended, on August 11, the railway station will have &quot;Awakening&quot;, when the old station building will be moved around in the 1980s.
&quot;From August 11 to 13, there are Tapa city days, during which home cafes are open in addition to the awakened station building and there are a series of cultural events, including a public rally,&quot; says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old city on those days.
The museum has been in the tiny yellow house on May 1 boulevard since 1994.
&quot;The house is small, but there are a lot of exhibits and a lot of information&quot;, Reigo praises the place, which is full of the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on the railway and the military.
Reigo smiles that if Tapa goes to all the recommended places, his stomach will soon be empty, but luckily the small town is full of cafes.
&quot;We have such good places to eat, and sometimes you feel like you&#39;re abroad when you sit in cafes,&quot; he describes.
Educated and young soldiers who came to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs-cafes, that&#39;s why when you sit there you have a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and in your hometown, but there is such an international group of people all around you.
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we are moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal camping
TV channel bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as saying that two Bulgarians were taken into custody for illegal camping in Greece.
On the morning of August 1, the police arrested a group of people illegally camping on the Sithonia peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but an investigation is currently underway.
The Foreign Ministry told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing stiff fines on anyone caught holidaying in a non-designated site.
Inspections continue throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court can impose a fine.
Wolves teaching puppies go to break sheep.
After a year&#39;s break, the farmers of Hiiumaa have to give the wolves &quot;educational material&quot; from their herd again - apparently the wolves that taught the puppies have already broken a lot of sheep.
This year, wolves have broken sheep in Hiiu county three times, a total of 23 sheep and injured eight, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year, the corresponding number was only three, the year before it was 124.
Data from the Environmental Agency, that no wolf litters were born in Hiiumaa last year, and information from the Hiiumaa Hunting Council, that this year two wolf litters were recorded on the island, are in sync with the violations.
On the night of Monday, wolves broke 15 sheep in Kabuna village of Emmaste municipality and injured half of the 18 surviving sheep.
Early on Wednesday morning, wolves broke one sheep in the pasture of Reheselja village and seriously injured another, which had to be euthanized.
The rules for handling genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent the draft law amending the Act on the Release of Genetically Modified Organisms into the Environment (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act for approval.
The amendment to the law waives the creation of a separate database for the locations and handlers of genetically modified (GM) crops, and the plant health register will be used for this purpose in the future.
In addition, the obligation of the operator of the GM crop to have a prior agreement with the person engaged in beekeeping within the prescribed radius is changed.
Although genetically modified crops are not grown in Estonia at the moment, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and non-genetically modified crops.
At least until it is decided to declare Estonia GMO-free&quot;, said Sigmar Suu, head of the plant health department of the Ministry of Agriculture.
&quot;At the same time, it must be taken into account that the developed measures must be goal-oriented and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both the private and public sectors&quot;, added Suu.
The draft law repeals the provisions related to the database of locations and handlers of GM crops and handling training in GMOVS, and establishes the requirements for handling GM crops and starting economic activities.
Specifically in relation to beekeeping, the previous obligation of the GM crop grower to inform the beekeepers about starting the cultivation of the GM crop will be replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before starting the cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with it in the draft information system and, if they wish, submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes primarily affect persons operating in the field of crop production, beekeepers and the Board of Agriculture.
In the European Union, including Estonia, it is allowed to grow only one GM crop - corn MON 810.
So far, however, none of the Estonian farmers are interested in growing GM crops.
The reason is that there is no corn pest in Estonia, the European stem borer, to which the corn line MON 810 is resistant.
Also, the varieties of this corn line have been bred for southern regions and this corn is not suitable for our climate.
In order to obtain the above certainty, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible contamination with GM organisms in the seeds of various rapeseed, corn and soy varieties grown in Estonia.
The analysis results of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes, and as a result of the study it was concluded that the seeds of rapeseed, corn and soy varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded from the above that genetically modified crops are not deliberately grown in Estonia, and it was also confirmed that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United have signed a &#39;genius&#39; in Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed a &quot;genius&quot; in Nemanja Matic after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The £40million Chelsea signing started in the starting line-up in United&#39;s final pre-season game in Dublin ahead of the Uefa Super Cup 2-1 win against Real Madrid on Tuesday, impressing in a defensive role while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were given free rein in attack.
But having been sidelined for the Blues&#39; pre-season tour of Asia, Matic lacked much-needed match form and lasted just 45 minutes. According to Mourinho, this must be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
&quot;He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, a brilliant mindset - he has a footballing mindset,&quot; Mourinho said.
&quot;We&#39;ll help him get in shape as soon as possible.&quot;
Like Matic, fellow new recruits Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the starting line-up at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho quietly began to settle his starting eleven for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to sign three more players, but he insisted the club had already done a &quot;great job&quot; signing three of his four priority choices.
&quot;I&#39;m grateful to the club that they were able to realize three out of four,&quot; he added.
&quot;I&#39;ll be even happier if they can make it four out of four, but they&#39;ve worked hard for me.&quot;
Another sookere pup got a GSM transmitter attached to his leg on August 1st, and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird watcher who lives in Sõrves, the first crane chick was equipped with a companion in Sõrves, and this litter is already flying around, has left the nesting place and joined the large roosting group in Mullutu-Suurlahe.
This is because there are no grain fields in Sõrve, Saarte Hääl writes.
On this Tuesday, already relatively late for ringing cranes, another crane chick was attached to the transmitter, and this one on Muhu island.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is actually an international project led by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, one crane named Mati was equipped with a GSM transmitter in Sõrves Türjul.
&quot;All of his actions can be viewed on the Internet: how he went to spend the winter in Spain, when he came back he was stuck on the border of Germany and Poland for a while, and then he came to Saaremaa&quot;, said Martinson.
A British inventor had a microchip implanted in his body to get into his house and car with a wave of his hand
A British inventor became the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he could open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with just a wave of his hand.
Steven Northam, 33, had a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and index finger and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson, consultant anesthetist at the Royal Hampshire Infirmary in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the fitting procedure meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to microchips implanted in cats and dogs, and the procedure takes just 30 seconds.
Northam&#39;s company is also changing house and car locks to be compatible with the chip, charging £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed the technology both at home and in his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House exhibit cost taxpayers thousands
The White House&#39;s decision to fly a Navy helicopter into the South Yard last month for an event celebrating American manufacturing cost taxpayers a whopping $24,000, according to military documents released to TIME.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, called Marine One when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of a July 17 White House event showcasing America&#39;s construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured industrial products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-built helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forklift made in Mississippi.
According to documents from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the squadron responsible for operating the helicopter, the White House War Office requested the helicopter&#39;s presence with a partial command, or FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Yard for an &quot;unusual&quot; event.
&quot;I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an unusually high-profile event,&quot; HMX-1&#39;s commanding officer said in an email the day before the event to his superior, the Navy&#39;s deputy commanding officer for aviation.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive at the south yard around 7 a.m. on July 17 for an event starting at 3 p.m. and would remain there until the yard was cleared between 6 and 9 p.m. that evening.
Added was the fact that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed, another crew would be needed for the return flight due to time constraints.
The original aircrew was with the helicopter during the event and the squadron&#39;s security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its time on the ground.
From the documents provided to TIME magazine, it was not possible to determine whether a second crew was needed in the end or not.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether this event might violate that provision.
&quot;We asked if this violated the Hatch Act and were told it did not,&quot; the commander wrote.
&quot;Looks like you don&#39;t have a choice,&quot; replied the deputy commanding officer.
The White House declared the event an official &quot;Made in America&quot; event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political undertones.
At the event, the president supported the health care reform efforts being debated in the Senate at the time and praised efforts to keep government regulations in check.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them for travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely for a photo shoot is unusual.
Trump came under fire in February when the presidential jet rolled into the background at his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account has been abuzz with messages complaining about his predecessor&#39;s use of the presidential jet.
&quot;The White House is very pleased with the ``Made in America&#39;&#39; display, which featured products from all 50 states, made with American materials by American workers,&quot; said Acting White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often conduct test flights around Washington, D.C. and in the South Yard to practice landing the President of the United States at the White House with centimeter accuracy.
While Trump was in Germany for the G20 summit in early July, HMX-1 made 58 test landings in the White House courtyard.
According to the official, the flight to the &quot;Made in America&quot; event was included in the flight crew&#39;s norm for that month&#39;s training flights.
The squadron&#39;s helicopters flew an additional 11 hours that day for &quot;non-presidential support missions.&quot;
According to the White House, no other exhibit at the event burdened the taxpayer&#39;s wallet.
According to a representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in organizing the display of the helicopter in the southern yard.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records of presidential flights, and it is difficult to ascertain the exact costs incurred by the event.
But according to the Ministry of Defense&#39;s 2017 financial year hourly rates, the compensation rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The squadron&#39;s records listed the flight from its home base at Naval Air Station Quantico, Virginia, as 30 minutes each way.
The White House says the actual cost of using the helicopter is well below that amount.
&quot;Calculating the cost to taxpayers based on estimated reimbursement rates is very misleading,&quot; Walters said.
&quot;These estimated reimbursement rates include staffing, maintenance and many other sunk costs that are factored into the annual appropriations.&quot;
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs, but they do cover costs related to fuel, maintenance and contracts.
Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the event at the time.
&quot;The point is to showcase things made in America this week,&quot; Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security and that there are probably hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to build.
So of course it&#39;s right to highlight it.&quot;
It is not clear whether or not Trump came into contact with the helicopter while touring the South Yard as part of the event, but he did get behind the wheel of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking to media outlets about the company&#39;s products in his personal fleet of aircraft.
&quot;I know Sikorsky very well,&quot; said the president, &quot;I have three of their products.&quot;
Grit Šadeiko - peace and joy came through tears
At the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, Šadeiko was hit by a leg cramp in the last stage, in the 800 m run, and the whip was taken away from the stadium on a stretcher.
Just before that, he had scored zero in the long jump at the Universiade held in China.
The 2012 European Championship in Helsinki was marred by an injury in the javelin throw, but at the debut Olympics held in London, he finished 23rd with 6013 points.
However, the misfortune continued.
At the 2013 World Cup in Moscow, after the opening day, the Estonian woman who was in the schedule of the Estonian record suffered a thumb injury in the long jump.
Two years later, he took 15th place at the World Championships in Beijing and fulfilled the Olympic standard, but this was also a disappointment for the athlete who wanted more.
Šadeiko passed the heaviest flag only last year, when at first he did not get a result in the long jump at the European Championship in Amsterdam.
I&#39;d just like to put together a proper multi-competition just once.
Once&quot;, Šadeiko confessed.
Worse was yet to come: a month later, his Olympic competition in Rio was cut short at the first hurdle due to a thigh injury.
Time had to be taken - should we continue with the heptathlon at all?
Is two days of effort still worth it all?
The girl thought for a long time, but found peace within herself.
I was able to clear my head
It&#39;s a relatively difficult experience to describe, but I&#39;ve been thinking that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal and clear my mind.
&quot;I knew I wasn&#39;t going to put the pills in my bag yet,&quot; says Šadeiko about his self-cleansing.
I was able to turn over a clean sheet and move forward with new momentum.
According to coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to watch the suffering of the ward, but she realized that above all, the athlete has to find clarity within himself.
He was so beaten down by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
&quot;However, Grit said that he will not give up and that he wants to prove to himself what he is worth&quot;, says Mägi.
Now there is some kind of peace in him.
He does it for his own pleasure.
The spirit of competition returned in May, when Šadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points in the Götzis multi-event.
In a high-level competition, he improved his personal best mark in the shot put by almost a meter (13.89) and ran close to the record time in the hurdles.
Then the multi-competitor felt that it was not the ceiling of his abilities at all, but that the primary competition hunger was extinguished.
Mägi, who has guided him for many years, says that Šadeiko is a model student.
He is a ready athlete, he is good to train.
If something is a problem or is wrong, he says so right away.
He knows his body and trusts his intuition.
This is what we have to start from.
I can&#39;t say what exactly needs to be done and we will follow it.
Šadeiko has also found a new approach.
&quot;I&#39;m not the kind of person who does the maximum in training&quot;, he says and says that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because it also guarantees a good result.
The baby happiness of loved ones makes you happy
Good emotions have also been offered to Šadeiko by the happiness of loved ones.
Both his former training partner Maris Mägi and his sister Grete recently became parents, and the multi-competitor has received support from new citizens of the world.
&quot;It has been quite interesting&quot;, says Šadeiko.
One alcohol, the drinking of which is equivalent to &quot;training&quot; the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Shepherd is such a big fan of wine that he believes that wine can train the brain better than anything else in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
According to him, it&#39;s not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the &quot;very active&quot; process of tasting wine.
By sniffing the glass, swirling the wine in our mouths, enjoying it and perceiving the aftertaste, we put our brains to work to create a taste for the wine.
According to Sheperd, wine molecules don&#39;t actually contain flavor, but the flavor comes from the way the wine stimulates the brain.
He compares it to how the brain &quot;sees&quot; colors.
&quot;The taste is not in the wine, the taste is created by the wine taster,&quot; says Sheperd.
Other things that affect the development of the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender and even the amount of saliva that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, admonishes that wine is not meant to be drunk.
&quot;There has to be more to the activity,&quot; he says.
If you take too big a sip, the system is oversaturated.
Drinking too much wine can do your brain more harm than good - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine risk memory loss, loss of balance and reduced mental ability.
10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector are paid less than their colleagues
The data of the personnel search company Fontes reveal that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector are paid less than their colleagues.
There is a ten percent wage gap between men and women, writes the Genius portal.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the Fontes ICT sector salary survey.
A total of 8,577 positions were under observation.
63% of positions were held by men.
&quot;Although only 3 companies stated that the salary difference is in favor of men, and according to the rest of the companies, there is no salary difference, in reality, comparing similar jobs, men&#39;s monthly basic salary is on average 10% higher than women&#39;s and men&#39;s annual total salary is on average 8% higher than women&#39;s&quot;, said the Fontes analyst Nordic weather.

According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The head of the United Nations mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN aid mission, said hundreds of women are running for local council elections, three women are running for vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
&quot;The importance of the role of women cannot be overstated,&quot; he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only truly represent the people and be credible if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
Afghanistan&#39;s local council elections and presidential elections will be held on April 5.
For their part, the Taliban have threatened the election process, which coincides with a transition period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year&#39;s elections mark the first time that power has been peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, a strong role for women will enhance the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to Afghanistan&#39;s Independent Election Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The joy of sharing makes everything more exciting for both young and old.
There is always too little time together, but training with bunnies provides a good opportunity to combine togetherness, play, closeness and exercise.
And what a convenient solution - no matter where you cruise in the summer, the live dumbbells are always with you and impatiently remind you with their tiny voices: &quot;Now let&#39;s exercise too!&quot;
Start with a warm-up - a simple game of hawk or a slide along the beach strip is very good.
The squat is the foundation of keeping your legs and butt in shape - who would want to get in the shape of a sandy cake washed by the waves during the summer?
It&#39;s wonderful to use children instead of a lever!
First, it is safe and comfortable, the weight gradually increases at the same pace as the strength of the exerciser.
Advanced people can also do squats with really big kids.
The child trains balance, counts repetitions and feels the joy of being able to hang high and be important.
Older children can do squats on their own at the same time.
Determine the range of motion by touching the ground and reaching your arms up.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the mini helper to hold them properly.
The child can read the replays and feel like a coach.
Plank is a very useful, but hopelessly boring exercise for a child.
But it&#39;s easy to make it more fun!
Game plank: take a long column of planks to crawl through in turn.
Actually harder than usual, but much more fun to do if you can shake hands with a friend in between.
To increase the load, you can stay in a plank, with the little one on your back, and walk around in this position.
For added weight, a smaller child can be placed on the hips, but this exercise is fun for all children.
While the crabs sizzle on the sand, the triceps, glutes and abs get a load like a crunch.
The child descends on his feet so that his body weight is distributed equally in front and behind.
Hands can be held for safety.
Bend your legs and stretch straight up.
The pom pom can fly, have fun, train balance and be a weight.
The little trainer&#39;s life is extra fun when he gets a little kiss every time he comes up.
Extra load is provided by stretching the legs forward.
Make sure your back stays in a neutral position.
Children themselves have much more fun doing abs in pairs and clapping.
Squat with handwork and pulse.
Observe the safety of the child, the position of the knee, and keep the back in a neutral position.
All children&#39;s favorite and great fun!
A really effective full body workout for the elderly.
The sports equipment was Ott (10), Säde (8), Ènne (4).
From the Philippines to the wide world, or Straw Bag trip to the heart of fashion fans
Bags woven from straws are a summer classic, which has become a hit product in its own right in recent years, which must be hanging on the arm of a true summer lover, and despite its humble origin, merchants have been able to attach a price tag appropriate to the hit.
A bag woven from straws is probably one of those things that have existed at least once in life and the possession of which has not caused special emotions.
It&#39;s just there, and if it&#39;s not, nothing&#39;s broken.
Now, however, straw bags are making a real comeback, and fashion fans have swapped their fancy designer bags for simple straw-woven bags for the summer months.
At the same time, it is not only a beach bag, but today it is just as popular as a street bag, and bolder women even walk with it to the office.
At this point, however, it is worth clarifying first whether a summer look like this for the boss still suits or if it is still worth pushing the notebook and laptop into a slightly more formal sumadan.
However, the versatility has made straw bags a true summer love of women.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing that catches your eye is that fashion connoisseurs rush to the local market first thing on vacation and buy themselves a straw bag, which they stick with for the entire vacation and which goes with them on the beach, in the market, and when hanging out with girlfriends in the city.
Some bloggers are even so generous that they buy a large batch of bags from the market and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.
At the same time, it is worth noting that the demand for bags among readers is so great that in the real world, women (and men!) would probably go hand-in-hand with each other to become the lucky owner of a bag.
In a way, this kind of madness is also understandable, because it is rare in the world of fashion when you can buy something that has become a hit for just a few tens of euros.
It&#39;s true, cunning merchants have also discovered an easy way to make money here, and finer luxury brands sell straw bags for a few hundred and thousands of euros.
Probably still so that richer customers don&#39;t have to feel like mere mortals walking around with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy yourself a Dolce &amp; Gabbana straw bag costing over a thousand euros.
However, the interpretation of a Chanel straw bag can cost around 6,000 euros.
However, unlike most fashion hits, straw bags do not come from some big fashion house, but their story began much further back.
Namely, straw bags are said to come from far away in the Philippines, where they have been widely distributed.
Straw bag weaving is primarily an export business there, and you don&#39;t see locals walking around with them very often.
The straw weaving technique is said to date back to the 14th century and is quite similar to regular basket weaving.
However, since a straw bag does not have to be braided as tightly as a basket, patterns and other materials can be woven into them, which make the bag more personal and even more attractive.
For example, bags with colored ribbons or leather strips woven into them are particularly trendy recently.
Straw bags can especially send a letter of thanks to the actress Jane Birkin, the biggest fan of braided straw bags has never been seen before.
Namely, he matched the straw bag with all kinds of clothing sets and didn&#39;t think much of going to the Cannes Film Festival with it.
The fact that taking care of them is a piece of cake plays no small role in the popularity of the bags today, and unlike all other sumadas, they do not need to be cared for with special tools, water and a wet towel do the trick.
As is always the case with trends, brands have come up with all kinds of interpretations in addition to the classic look.
For example, if you wish, you can buy a straw braided radish bag or a small shoulder bag instead.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that a classic straw bag will never go out of fashion, but a straw griddle will.
But what is a classic straw bag?
Such a bag woven from straw, which resembles a basket in its style, is open at the top and has short handles, also made of straw, has been considered classic for centuries.

A man missing three days ago in Saaremaa was found
Aare left his home in Kärla township in an unknown direction on Wednesday evening.
The last contact with Aare was by phone yesterday, Friday evening, and the positioning of the phone gave the location of the man in Lääne-Saare municipality, Mõnnuste village, where they searched for him with a helicopter until midnight and with dogs until early morning.
Then the battery of his phone ran out, and therefore it was no longer possible to determine the man&#39;s location.
Police continued their search this morning.
The police would like to thank everyone who helped find the treasure.
GMB is concerned about investment in McVitie&#39;s Glasgow factory
The union is awaiting confirmation from managers at biscuit manufacturer McVitie&#39;s about long-term production plans at the company&#39;s Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has remained silent on the future of the Tollcross site investment.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits and other products, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, owner of McVitie&#39;s, said they have invested more than £5 million in the site over the last couple of years.
More workers were hired there, and union presidents &quot;are the first to hear&quot; if something changes in the factory&#39;s operations.
In a letter to the company&#39;s site manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie&#39;s to &quot;address concerns that funding is not being used to modernize production lines&quot;.
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we are not getting clarity from the site&#39;s chief executive about Tollcross&#39;s business needs and future investment plan is of deep concern to our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is largely drawn from the local community and people from around Glasgow, an essential pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
So in terms of jobs, pay and welfare, and in the face of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic shrinking of manufacturing, the East of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving McVitie&#39;s business.&quot;
A representative for Pladis said: “The site manager at Tollcross only received the letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company is responding directly to him as we value active communication with staff and union representatives.
Two months ago, there was a regular meeting between workers and GMB representatives at Tollcross where a number of issues were openly discussed.
We then discussed with the employees that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we review our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our companies and facilities - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: “In recent years we have invested over £5 million in the Tollcross site, the majority of which has gone into production lines and operational improvements.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to the operation of the site, staff and union representatives will be the first to hear.&quot;
Did PSG warn Barcelona about approaching Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain are not giving up in their bid to lure Neymar to their ranks, making a £189m bid to buy him out. But did they warn Barcelona of this record-breaking conquest three years ago?
The high-profile approach has opened the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club poised to more than double the current world record for over-buying, set last season by Paul Pogba&#39;s £89m return to Manchester United.
Once the transfer is completed, Neymar will become the world&#39;s most expensive player as well as the highest paid professional athlete in the world, earning over £500,000 a week after payments from PSG.
Barcelona are known to be angry at both the approach and the release of Neymar, although a source close to the Catalans board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the footballer since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the football world of such a possibility three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a stern warning to any clubs thinking of signing some of PSG&#39;s best players.
&quot;I&#39;m not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we will confront them and contact those players,&quot; Al-Khelaifi said.
&quot;We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign any of our players, they will have to face the consequences.&quot;
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club showing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG have made it clear that they will not let the Italian leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could be hit back as a result of this interest by losing one of their prized assets in the form of Neymar.
PM: Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders after Brexit.
&quot;Brexit seriously threatens to drive a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, between Britain and Ireland,&quot; Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland since taking office in June.
&quot;I can&#39;t imagine who would benefit from it,&quot; he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible, Varadkar said.
&quot;This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders&quot;, he emphasized.
According to Varadkar, he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union, and since that is not possible, to remain part of the European Common Market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain&#39;s departure smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained the Irish Prime Minister.
Noting that such an arrangement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: &quot;We could certainly have one with Britain&quot;.
The alternative would be a return to customs points that herald historical division and political failure.
&quot;A barrier to trade, prosperity and peace,&quot; said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit &quot;the challenge of our generation&quot; and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of daily life in Northern Ireland.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland during a visit to Belfast.
Märt Avand, who completed his first half-length triathlon: Anyone can complete an Ironman.
Today, the biggest triathlon festival in the Baltic States was held in the winter capital Otepää, when approximately one thousand triathletes from over thirty countries took part in the half-length Ironman competition.
The 70.3 mile distance consisted of a 1.9 km swim, a 90 km bike ride and a 21.1 km bike ride.

Despite the complexity, Avandi recognized that, in fact, triathlon is affordable for almost everyone.
&quot;It&#39;s not the distance that kills, but the pace,&quot; he said, hinting that almost anyone can reach the finish line at a reasonable pace.
Except for Ott Sepp: &quot;Ot&#39;s physique is fine, but unfortunately he can&#39;t swim&quot;.
Avandi had been training hard since February.
At first 4-5 hours a week, but later already ten hours a week.
With a time of 05:34:12, he took 270th place overall.
