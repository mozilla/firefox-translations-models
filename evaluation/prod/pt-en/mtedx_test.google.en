When I was seven, I couldn&#39;t read, and all the girls in my class could read.
So I kept charging and blaming myself because I wanted to learn like everyone else.
Then my mother bought me several books that came with CDs and I listened to CDs and followed along, because I didn&#39;t know how to read.
Finally, I learned to read.
And when I learned to read, the whole world opened up to me.
I started dreaming things that I thought I couldn&#39;t do but the books said, &quot;You can!&quot;
And one of those dreams was to go to university.
No one in my family has a college degree.
But I believed that I had to go to university.
So I went there.
I have to go to university.
I have to do.
I told my mother: &quot;I have to go to university&quot;.
She went there, paid for a course for me, with all the difficulties she had.
And I entered university at the age of 18.
In an extremely elite course, which is Architecture and Urbanism, at one of the largest universities in the country.
And then I thought, &quot;Wow, that&#39;s my happy ending!
I&#39;m in awe, everything&#39;s ready.&quot;
Only not.
The university is not a welcoming space for people like me, regardless of the course.
What determines the reception you will receive is your color.
And I, besides my color, was a woman.
And I liked to talk, talk a lot.
But don&#39;t talk like that, on a stage.
Using writing, and that bothers.
So I started to feel bad in that space, and you start to feel bad, you start to feel bad, and when you see it, you&#39;re very sad.
And you are not sad for one day, you are sad for a month, a year.
You no longer want to leave the house.
And I didn&#39;t want to leave the house anymore.
I was depressed.
The height of this was when I ended up in a hospital.
And then I was in a crisis, I couldn&#39;t speak.
I just wanted to cry.
I just wanted help.
And then that doctor looked at me and said, &quot;You&#39;re depressed.&quot;
And now?
In 1996, I was three years old and my father left home.
And then my mother found herself alone, pregnant, and with a three-year-old daughter.
This is the story of many women.
Including many black women like me.
And my mom, to deal with it, she wrote me a letter.
I was three years old, I couldn&#39;t read.
I told you that I learned well after everyone else.
But she wrote.
And then I understood that my mother had actually written that letter, which I went to read years later, because she wanted to deal with that pain.
And after a few years, my grandfather died.
And he was like a father to me.
And he was the first man in my grandmother&#39;s life, the only one.
The person she gave her life to.
And she misses you.
I miss you.
So... Every day my grandmother writes to him.
And I cry because it&#39;s daily, it&#39;s every day.
She opens a notebook and she writes: &quot;Dear Daniel...&quot; and she tells him about her day.
And then... Years later I read a book called &quot;Quarto de Despejo&quot;, which is also a diary of a black woman, poor, from the favela, who also had to take care of her children without a man present.
And she did that picking up cardboard on the street.
And this woman, she says in the book, that when she gets nervous, when she can&#39;t deal with everyday situations, she writes.
And she wrote on papers that she grabbed from the trash. And then I needed help and I thought, &quot;If all these women who are important in my life write, why can&#39;t I write?&quot;
So I started to write.
Wrote in diaries.
Then I started writing poetry, I started writing on social networks, then someone said: &quot;Don&#39;t you want to write a text, on my blog?&quot;
I said, &quot;Oh!
Why not?&quot;
Then I started writing on one blog, then another.
I wrote a column here, something else there.
I started to have thousands of followers, who were black women like me, who would message me and say, &quot;What you write is about me, it&#39;s for me.&quot;
And I said, &quot;Guys!
This is much bigger than I imagined.&quot;
So, that year, aged 23, I was invited by the largest publisher in the country to write a book.
(Applause) And I say that because writing is important to me.
Writing, as writer Paulina Chiziane says, literature for her is the way she negotiates her dignity.
That&#39;s what writing is for me.
So I&#39;m here to try to say what I do to deal with the weaknesses that I can&#39;t have, because I&#39;m a black woman, Society says I have to be strong, that I can&#39;t come here and cry, that I don&#39;t I can go to my social network and say how difficult it is to live without a father, for example.
Society says I have to bear everything behind my back.
Society says I have to be strong, strong, strong.
I can not take it anymore.
I don&#39;t want to be strong anymore.
I want to be able to be weak.
So I write, also to not feel so much guilt, to forgive myself.
I suggest you do this, because for me writing is healing.
Thanks.
(Applause)
My uncle came to Brasília in 1972, carrying this suitcase here.
That was all he had.
And, inside that suitcase, there was more book than clothes.
It&#39;s funny, but for his project, that made perfect sense, because he came to Brasília with a very clear objective in mind: &quot;I&#39;m going to Brasília so I can study and succeed in life through my studies&quot;.
That&#39;s why he brought so many books in his suitcase.
After he came, my whole family came too, and my mother made the same move as my uncle: &quot;I&#39;m going to Brasília to study and make my career there&quot;.
This whole story happened before I was born.
When I was born, that suitcase was already here.
And the project for this suitcase worked out super well for both my uncle and my mother: they studied and succeeded in life.
So, by the natural logic of things, a project that worked for my uncle and worked for my mother would work for me too.
But when I went to school, I didn&#39;t find myself at school, I didn&#39;t do well.
And then, very early on, I started to suffer from the Sunday night syndrome, which was a desperate ghost that appeared on Sundays to say: &quot;Oh, tomorrow is Monday and you&#39;re going to have to do something you don&#39;t like to do.
You&#39;re going to have to carry a bag you don&#39;t want to carry.&quot;
I suffered from this syndrome almost all my student life and most of my professional life as well.
For you to have an idea, out of every ten people, seven suffer from Sunday night syndrome.
It is very likely that you suffer from this syndrome too.
And if you suffer from this syndrome, it&#39;s because on Monday you&#39;re doing something you don&#39;t like to do, carrying a suitcase you don&#39;t want to carry.
The first time I got rid of this syndrome was by the greatest luck in the world.
A teacher showed up at my school and she got everyone to do what they liked to do the most, and it was really cool because I started to enjoy Mondays.
But I grew up, entered the job market, became an advertiser and, after a while, the syndrome bothered me again, only this time it was much worse, because I had an established career, I had a child to raise and I had a lots of bills to pay.
I had the profession I wanted, the job I wanted, the salary I wanted, but I wasn&#39;t doing well.
And the truth is this: it doesn&#39;t matter your profession, your position, your salary.
The truth is, if you suffer from the syndrome, it&#39;s because you carry a suitcase that you don&#39;t want and you keep doing it because you have bills to pay.
I wanted you to stop and think a little bit there: what if you didn&#39;t have bills to pay?
What were you going to do with your life?
There are people who will say: &quot;Wow, I can&#39;t even stop to think about it.
I have so many bills to pay...&quot; (Laughter) Or else: &quot;No, I wouldn&#39;t do anything.
I would travel or watch Netflix all day, whatever.&quot;
But think about it a little bit, really: what would you want to spend your time and energy doing?
If the answer came into your head there, your way out is there.
You will stop suffering from Sunday night syndrome when you start putting this into practice.
And so, if the answer didn&#39;t come to your head, if the answer didn&#39;t appear at that moment, you need to find it because this is very serious.
Really, this is very serious.
It&#39;s very likely that when you find what you want to do with your life, you don&#39;t know how to do it and maybe you want to take everything out of your suitcase at once and put everything in there too.
Only that&#39;s not how you&#39;re going to make such an important change in your life.
We exchange what&#39;s inside our suitcase little by little.
For example, if you enjoy photography, you want to be a photographer, you need a camera in your bag.
Of course, you don&#39;t need a whole photo studio.
You need to put photography in your life.
If you like to cook, start testing some elaborate recipes with your friends, start doing it for free at first, start experimenting at first, put cooking in your life.
When you least realize it, your suitcase will be complete and full of things you decided to carry, things you chose, things that make sense to you and that are useful to other people too.
My suitcase is light and easy to carry.
What I carry in that suitcase today is a project that I chose.
It&#39;s not my uncle&#39;s project, my mother&#39;s project, an advertising project.
It&#39;s a project that I chose, which is to help people discover what they like to do and they can find ways to live from it.
On Sunday night, you will remember this conversation we are having today.
Perhaps because you are fine with the arrival of Monday; relaxed because you&#39;re doing something you enjoy, or because Sunday night syndrome is bothering you.
If it&#39;s because of the syndrome, go pack your bag.
Thanks.
(Applause) (Cheers)

Good morning!
I was born premature, in Rio de Janeiro.
My father had traveled to play his first international show, and he arrived in Portugal, called Brazil and my mother was in the hospital, she had a placental abruption and I was almost born.
He came back the same day, the show in Portugal was cancelled, and I was born a month later.
(Laughs) It was the first time I entered the scene.
I grew up in this family of artists, very affectionate, very sincere.
My first attempt at the art world was in ballet.
My mother sent me to the school where she studied in her youth.
It didn&#39;t last a month.
I liked the classes, but one day the teacher said that the uniform was mandatory and I never went back.
My second attempt was in music.
I started studying piano... sorry, it wasn&#39;t piano.
I started studying recorder and singing, and soon after I joined a children&#39;s choir.
And I spent all my afternoons at the music school, I created a very strong bond with that space and those people.
Then, one day, there was a presentation in a hall of a university here in Porto Alegre, with the choir, and for the first time I was going to be a soloist.
At one point I sang lead vocals alone.
I&#39;ve always been very shy, so singing in a huge auditorium didn&#39;t sound very comfortable to me.
And music, until then, was a joke for me, and suddenly I found myself in charge of the group.
Anyway, there were a lot of rehearsals, I was very nervous, but we did the presentation, everything went well.
I was happy, a little relieved.
And then, I&#39;m leaving the stage, happy and all, and a lady comes towards me, smiling, she stops in front of me, congratulates me and says: &quot;Honey!
It couldn&#39;t be otherwise.
It&#39;s in the blood.&quot;
I didn&#39;t understand what she was saying to me.
It was really weird.
What did she mean by that?
I didn&#39;t take it as a compliment, actually.
It was strange, but deep down it was a little frustrating.
She was referring to my father, who was a musician, or my mother, who is also an artist.
Is it in the blood?
You mean I was born with it?
There are several studies in this area.
There is a survey that was carried out in Canada by a Brazilian researcher, with 30 babies.
And some of these babies were exposed to a prelude by Maurice Ravel for ten days, three times a day.
At the end of this process, all babies were put through a test, and those who listened to the music at home during the week paid more attention to it than to other works.
That is, they developed a musical sensitivity by being exposed to music.
I was born into a very musical family.
There was a piano at home, any birthday had a band in the living room.
I also developed a musical sensitivity, but the environment in which we are inserted contributes to the development of our abilities, our competences.
And I read a survey that was done in the United States, that when public schools were on a tight budget, they did musical aptitude tests to see who could attend music classes.
That is, the idea was to select those who had ease or genetic predispositions for music.
And they applied that same test to the instrumentalists of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which is a large orchestra.
And half of the musicians scored below average.
Half of the musicians.
That is, according to these tests, none of those musicians had genetic predispositions for this, to work with this.
But they were there, and they are great players in a great orchestra, it wasn&#39;t blood that got them there.
We have the record, we human beings have the biological, psychological and imaginary record.
And there is no prevalence of one record over the other.
We are the bonding of the three.
Today I understand the discomfort and frustration I had when I was little.
I don&#39;t deny genetics, I don&#39;t deny the influence of the social environment even before I was born.
But none of that would have made me a singer if it hadn&#39;t been my choice.
It&#39;s not just in the blood.
Thanks.
(Applause)
In the month of May, it will be eight years since I&#39;ve been involved in this project, which I&#39;m dedicating everything I have.
But basically, I like to say that I&#39;m dedicating half of my breath to this project that I&#39;m going to talk to you about today, and that it&#39;s giving results that we thought would happen, just not with the speed that they&#39;re happening.
Eight years ago, I was introduced to a disease that, until then, I did not know about, and which it is very likely that most of us all here do not know.
Even medical professionals know about it, but are not necessarily prepared or know how to act when it is identified.
I&#39;m talking about sepsis, also commonly known as nosocomial infection or sepsemia, several other words that, when you don&#39;t know it, talk about it.
Even a Brazilian research institute conducted a survey last year and asked people on the street if they knew what sepsis was.
Ninety percent of them thought it was a rock band.
(Laughter) This ignorance is general.
Sepsis, since it was identified as an organ dysfunction, has already killed more than 100 million people worldwide.
Sepsis is a disease that kills more people than traffic accidents, not only in Brazil, but worldwide.
Every two minutes, sepsis kills one person worldwide, and on May 28, 2010, sepsis killed my daughter.
On May 29th, I had to close a grave and I didn&#39;t know what to do with all the love and anticipation I had built up over those 18 days she was with us.
Laura was born on May 10, 2010 and she changed interface with me on May 28, 2010.
Since that day, I&#39;ve been dedicating absolutely everything I have: my heritage, house, car... motorcycle.
This is the hardest part.
(Laughter) Everything.
Today I dedicate all my life, all my energy; today I share this project with 25 people who are completely passionate about what we are doing.
Today Laura is deployed in a few dozen hospitals and transacting the data of millions of patients.
What she is doing in each of these hospitals is identifying which patient has sepsis.
I&#39;m going to explain a little more how it works, but I think that, first of all, it is necessary to understand what is the limitation that exists in this context.
If we look at other diseases, other operational problems, they are related to organic triggers, biological triggers.
A person who has a heart problem will automatically have heart failure, and this will trigger a protocol.
Sepsis does not have a biological trigger.
It simply brings together several factors that end up deteriorating the clinical situation of the patient, regardless of being an ICU patient or a patient who is in a bed in a normal ward.
He takes that risk.
In fact, any one of us is at risk of having sepsis at any time.
Unlike other illnesses, sepsis is completely controllable if caught in time.
If, within a timely period, the professionals manage to carry out the necessary interventions, at least the person does not die from sepsis.
Maybe she will die from the comorbidities of her disease, she will die from other problems, but she doesn&#39;t die from sepsis.
That&#39;s what we&#39;re doing.
I developed the world&#39;s first cognitive risk management platform.
They are robots with artificial intelligence that connect to hospital databases, which connect to laboratory machines and remotely analyze this information hours in advance.
They make this transit in a fraction of seconds inside the hospital and manage to advance the person&#39;s risk status by approximately ten hours.
They indicate, of all the patients admitted to the hospital, which of them are at risk of sepsis, which of them are at risk of clinical deterioration that will lead to sepsis.
Today, two years after we activated Laura...
The first hospital in which we activated the robot was on July 26, 2016, in a philanthropic hospital in Curitiba, by the way, the most courageous of all, because the sisters had the courage, which many others did not, to bring an innovative technology, an unknown technology, but a technology produced here, Brazilian, made with love, made with care, made with care, but which is cutting-edge, which leaves nothing to be desired for anyone.
They accepted us to activate this technology in Curitiba, and, since then, Laura has already saved hundreds of people.
It identifies, more than ten hours in advance, who will have this problem.
Furthermore, it is transacting the data of millions of people, and all with the sole purpose of accelerating the diagnosis or prediction that this is happening.
We could handle this in many ways.
Health technology is not new.
Artificial intelligence is not new.
But what&#39;s behind this project is a simple word, it&#39;s something related to what we all have and give for free: love.
I could have taken all that expectation and put it on another platform, or I could have put it in other conditions or forgotten or dealt with grief in other ways.
But that&#39;s not the loss that has motivated me.
It&#39;s the love for Laura, and the promise I made to her on the 29th of May that no one would forget her name in this era and that no mother would go to sleep crying anymore because of a totally manageable situation, it&#39;s happening today, and, soon it will help many more people around the world.
So, impacting a billion lives is not difficult, as long as you don&#39;t restrict your life to pain or loss, you dedicate it to someone else.
So &quot;let&#39;s&quot; save lives with us?
Thank you guys.
(Applause) (Cheers)
Rogério Martins is a professor and researcher in mathematics at the Faculty of Science and Technology of Universidade Nova de Lisboa.
He is committed to popularizing science among the general public, and is the author and presenter of the television program &#39;Isto é Mathematical&#39;.
What would you like to invert?
&quot;The math picture, of course.&quot;
(Applause) Rogério Martins: I&#39;m a mathematician, and I want to talk about some of the reasons why I fell in love with math.
Contrary to what many people think, I was never really a brilliant math student.
In fact, when I was a high school student, I wasn&#39;t a brilliant student.
It wasn&#39;t that I wasn&#39;t interested in the subjects I studied.
In fact, they interested me, and I always found all areas fascinating.
In fact, it&#39;s one of the things I want to talk to you about.
But the truth is, I didn&#39;t have a huge interest in getting good grades.
When I applied for college, I had several interests.
From economics to psychology to biology.
But the truth is, I couldn&#39;t get into those courses because I didn&#39;t have enough grades to get into them.
And I ended up getting into math.
For better or for worse, because I immediately fell in love with math.
I want to tell you, essentially, what made me fall in love with mathematics.
Suddenly, from average grades, good enough to pass, I had one of the best averages on the course.
What made me fall in love with Mathematics?
I would say the first reason was when I realized that mathematics was about ideas.
In high school, I found Mathematics interesting, but there were so many math, I didn&#39;t understand what the Big Picture was.
I&#39;d say math is to math what dribbling is to basketball.
In fact, we have to know how to dribble to play basketball.
But what&#39;s really beautiful is watching the game, watching the game happen, watching the game from behind.
See the strategy.
And it&#39;s exactly the same with music, as we saw earlier.
It is true that we have to practice scales, but what is beautiful is listening to the complete work and enjoying it.
With Mathematics it is the same thing.
And I realized one day that, in fact, mathematics was much more about ideas than I thought.
It is much more a philosophy of life than a set of disconnected and meaningless equations.
That was one of the reasons that led me to fall in love with Mathematics.
The second was that I realized that I could get at a lot — a lot of those things that I liked: biology, economics, sociology, all those things.
I could get there through Mathematics.
And that&#39;s what I want to show you here in particular, with a concrete example of my work in Mathematics.
It&#39;s true that I can&#39;t show equations, because they probably wouldn&#39;t understand them, but I can show something concrete, which has directly to do with what I do, and it&#39;s something I usually have in mind when I study these equations.
The idea is the following: Now I&#39;m going to do an experiment.
I have two cans here, I have a board, which I will place here on top of the cans, and here I have two metronomes.
Metronomes, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar with them, are devices used to measure compasses.
Basically it&#39;s a clock that musicians use to measure time.
These metronomes are tuned to a certain frequency, in this case 208 beats per minute — it&#39;s a very helpful one.
I&#39;ll put it up front.
Do you hear?
I have another metronome here.
In fact, these metronomes, although they are set to the same frequency, do not oscillate in sync.
By the way, I just dropped them here, but they tend not to have exactly the same frequency, although they are tuned to the same frequency.
What&#39;s curious is that when I place them on top of this board, if I wait a bit... ...a strange thing happens.
They interfere with each other.
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s visible from there, but this board wobbles slightly, and they end up synchronizing — now they&#39;re back down.
This synchronization is not immediate, but after a while they end up synchronizing.
This is fantastic, because we humans synchronize many times, when we play an instrument, or when we dance.
But that two inanimate objects can do this, in a way, communicate with each other and come to the conclusion of what rhythm they should follow, is really an impressive thing.
This phenomenon that we&#39;re looking at is something that was discovered by Christiaan Huygens in the 17th century.
He discovered this by chance, he happened to have two metronomes on the same shelf.
Then it was forgotten for many years and recently, it was realized that it is a much more common phenomenon than previously thought.
For example — I&#39;ll give several examples: In biology, it appears in fireflies.
Fireflies have a flash, and that flash is periodic.
Just as a metronome oscillates periodically, the firefly also turns a light on and off periodically, and interferes with its neighbors.
And a fantastic thing happens in certain communities of fireflies: they synchronize movements and, suddenly, they start to adjust the flashes, and, little by little, there are thousands of fireflies that synchronize their movement, as if each firefly were one of these metronomes .
They synchronize their movement and emit a flash all at the same time.
This is a case of synchronization in biology.
In economics there are also cases.
For example, markets fluctuate and each one of them is like a metronome.
By oscillating they interfere with neighbors through trade, exports, etc.
Again, there is a synchronization phenomenon here that economists study.
Then we have, for example, the case of the electrical network.
I don&#39;t know if you know, we have a current called alternating current.
The current oscillates in our house, in our socket.
And when an electrical engineer needs to connect a power plant to the national grid, he needs synchronization.
It needs the oscillation of the power plant to synchronize with the oscillation of the electrical network.
Again, it&#39;s a synchronization phenomenon.
There is a very curious case in medicine, where there are several phenomena of synchronization, something called the circadian cycle.
Next we will have someone talking about neurobiology, here there is also a bit of neurobiology.
In medicine, this circadian cycle is actually an organ that we have in our body.
We have a set of cells that mark the rhythm of the 24-hour day.
It&#39;s basically the clock that makes us always go to bed at the same time, or want to eat at the same time.
It&#39;s what causes jet lag.
This clock is made up of a set of cells, each of which interferes with the neighboring cell, and synchronizes movement with the neighboring cell.
In fact, this set of cells is a phenomenon of synchronization.
There are thousands of cells that synchronize in oscillation with neighboring cells.
Here we have another synchronization phenomenon.
Then our clock synchronizes with the day-and-night cycle.
Again, a synchronization phenomenon.
Very curious because, in this second, our clock, our metronome, is still disturbed by the day-and-night cycle, but the day-and-night cycle is not disturbed by our clock, but even so, there is a phenomenon of synchronization here. .
This to show you that this phenomenon, which appears in these metronomes, appears in many areas.
And what we mathematicians do -- actually we, myself in particular, don&#39;t have a lab full of metronomes to run experiments on, and boards, and cans, and such.
But I have a brain.
I have a brain and I have equations.
What we do, essentially, is extract the theoretical juice from these phenomena that happen in all these areas, and treat it mathematically, with equations, with mathematical tools.
That&#39;s the power of mathematics.
In fact, I would say that one of the phrases that best characterizes mathematics was said by Poincaré.
He says that &quot;Mathematics is the art of giving different things the same name&quot;.
What is happening here, that is, when I mathematically study all these various phenomena, which occur in various areas of human knowledge, I am actually giving &quot;the same name&quot;, the same mathematical name, to all these phenomena that, apparently they were separate phenomena.
It was not realized that they had a relationship until a few years ago.
And that&#39;s what math does.
Mathematics creates bridges.
Poincaré himself says that the great advances in science occur when we manage to connect two things, apparently disconnected, and realize that they have something in common after all.
Usually this connection is made by mathematics.
And that&#39;s what&#39;s fantastic.
I would say that mathematics, or doing mathematics, is leaving a comprehensive footprint — comprehensive because when I work mathematically on a problem, such as these of synchronization, which has occupied me for some time in recent years, I am working on all of them at the same time. these problems, and hence the connection with the beginning of my lecture, in which I said that I liked all areas.
I even say to my students, or to those people who are applying to university, that if they like everything, maybe the best thing is mathematics, because in fact mathematics creates connections to everything.
Therefore, it is a footprint, I would say, comprehensive, permanent.
Permanent because it is permanent, mathematics has no time.
The Pythagorean Theorem was as valid two thousand years ago as it is today.
Mathematics is either right or wrong.
If she&#39;s right, she&#39;s right, and she&#39;ll stay that way forever.
If it&#39;s wrong, at most it can be (unintelligible). And there&#39;s some math that falls by the wayside because it&#39;s not interesting enough.
Or because it was not used, because it was not passed on to the next generation.
But that&#39;s another question.
That math was right, it&#39;s just not interesting.
Not all math is interesting.
Finally, there is a fantastic feeling of working in mathematics, which is the feeling of walking a path that we realize is, in fact, terra incognita.
It&#39;s the feeling that we&#39;ve reached a place that it was impossible for anyone not to reach one day.
This is felt, above all, in mathematics.
Very often we build theories and realize that those theories are not the fruit of our imagination.
They were there, that is, an intelligent being from another planet would probably arrive at exactly the same place.
It would come to exactly the same conclusions — albeit eventually in different language — but, let&#39;s say, the mathematical juice was there, that mathematical idea was there.
And that is, in fact, another impressive thing.
Another phrase that I really like — this is a phrase that I had by my side for a long time on my desk and that is by Pascal — says: &quot;Through space, the universe embraces me and swallows me up like a point. .
&quot;By thought, I embrace it.&quot;
This is, to me, the warrior&#39;s revenge, and again it&#39;s mathematics.
When we feel small, physically, there is a certain comfort in thinking that, from a psychological point of view, our imagination, our thinking, is really big, and we manage to get practically everywhere through our thinking.
In a way, there is a certain revenge here for our smallness.
In conclusion, and to leave you thinking a little, precisely with this thought that is comprehensive and powerful, I would like to show you what is perhaps the problem that will occupy me in the near future.
Or in the next few years, perhaps.
In fact, in synchronization, we can&#39;t understand everything.
There&#39;s still a lot to figure out, a lot.
By the way, in mathematics, it is very common for people to have the feeling that it is a somewhat crystallized science, that there is no longer any research in mathematics.
In fact, it&#39;s just the opposite.
Mathematics is one of the most active areas these days.
One of the things that we don&#39;t understand is the following: We have these two metronomes here, and we saw them oscillating, just now, in phase, that is, they oscillated both to one side, both to the other.
The thing is, Huygens didn&#39;t see this.
He had different metronomes, he actually had big clocks.
He saw the two swinging in, and the two swinging out.
And that&#39;s not exactly what we were seeing.
Now, it&#39;s possible that Huygens got in the water.
(Sound of desynchronized metronomes) (Sound of synchronized metronomes) Here you go, thank you very much.
(Applause)
What we know and what we&#39;ve experienced make us who we are today.
Our questions, the ones we are looking for answers to, will make us who we will be tomorrow.
Curiosity is what lies behind these questions.
And curiosity is something I&#39;ve discovered since I started doing research back in high school.
But it took some time and literally crossing an ocean to understand the power of it.
During high school, I did research, I studied at a school called Fundação Liberato, which is relatively close to here.
There, doing scientific research is a true tradition, so all students do research.
From the first year at that school, I started doing science projects.
My first project, together with Viviane and Gabriela, two colleagues from the technical course, was around 2007 and we heard a lot about global warming and the gases that caused the greenhouse effect and we were very worried about that.
After all, did our school, the school activities we did there, contribute to global warming?
And then, we did our first project, which was to calculate mathematically and with a lot of data collection, how much gas our school emits, carbon dioxide, during its school activities; and how much it absorbed, because inside the school there was a eucalyptus plantation.
It was a mathematical account, we added and subtracted there, and we discovered that the balance was positive.
The school absorbed more gas than it emitted, which was great for the environment.
We did this project, presented it at science fairs... and we didn&#39;t win anything.
But everything is fine.
We moved on to the next stage, which was to create a new project.
Because of the eucalyptus plantations, we noticed that nothing grew around the eucalyptus trees.
And then our second project was to create a natural herbicide with eucalyptus leaves.
What we basically did was mix the eucalyptus leaves with water, creating an extract that was able to stop the growth of weeds.
And then we went to a science fair again, showed this project and we didn&#39;t win anything.
But that&#39;s okay, we were learning a lot from this process.
And then, in the third year, I was no longer obliged to do a project, but we liked it so much, going to fairs and not winning anything, that it made a lot of sense to continue.
And then we wanted to do something more challenging, it was already our third project.
We decided to completely change areas, maybe the &quot;zica&quot; was because we are working with the environment, so let&#39;s go to the health area.
And then we decided to create a dressing with nanoparticles.
From a familiar history, I already knew a little about the amputation process.
The idea was to create a bandage that could be used in the postoperative period of amputation and reimplantation of limbs.
Basically, what we did was put some nanoparticles on this tissue that had an antimicrobial effect, so preventing bacteria and fungi from proliferating, and another that had a thermal insulating effect, thus warming the skin and increasing blood flow.
Again we went with this project to a fair.
And we didn&#39;t win anything.
But then we went to another one and started winning some awards.
Some of that experience led me to the fourth project, which is basically a continuation of the third one.
After studying so much about the process of amputation and reimplantation of limbs, I realized that most amputations occur in people with diabetes, usually in lower limbs, because these people develop some typical problems, which we call diabetic foot.
And the idea was to use that same fabric to create a sock that could treat the diabetic foot.
Because of these projects, I lived experiences that were incredible.
I started winning some awards and that taught me a lot.
But, basically, let&#39;s think about how these projects occur, how they arise, how scientists work.
And then I would like you to close your eyes and think about a wonderful phase in your life.
That, puberty, can be eye opening.
Puberty is a wonderful phase, a chaos of physiology.
And at puberty, we use the scientific method a lot.
Imagine you at age 13 when you looked in the mirror and suddenly noticed a red dot right in the middle of your forehead.
It was a pimple.
Scientists start precisely there, with observation, and then they identify the problem.
This is definitely a problem.
On the weekend you have a party and, hey, nobody wants to get a pimple at the party.
And then you go to the hypothesis.
And your hypothesis might be that you can remove that pimple using your hands.
And then the scientist moves on to the next step, which is the planning and execution of an experiment.
You go in front of the mirror and squeeze your pimple.
And then we go to the result.
The result was dismal: its spine is now visible from 10 meters away.
Before you arrive at the party, she&#39;ll arrive first and say hi to everyone.
And then we go to conclusion, which is the final step.
But actually, it never ends, because always, in science, when you come to a conclusion it brings up a lot of other questions.
Basically then, we start with observation, and we find a problem.
Create a hypothesis, design and execute an experiment that brings results, a conclusion and again new questions.
I learned a lot when doing research; but I still hadn&#39;t learned what was most special and essential about being a scientist.
And I had to go to Israel to be able to see that.
In 2013, I was selected to go to Israel for a five-week research exchange at the Weizmann Institute, which is one of the largest research institutes in the world.
And I was there, in the middle of over 80 young people from all over the world, all about to enter university.
And I was put to work with my mentor, who was a neuroscientist named Hila Harris.
With it, what I was basically doing was trying to understand some functions of the brain.
I would always approach her and ask: &quot;Hila, what will we be able to solve when we understand what your project wants to unveil.
What problem are we going to solve?&quot;
She said &quot;Kawoana, I don&#39;t know what this is going to be for&quot;.
I was so frustrated with that, because in my vast experience as a scientist throughout my high school, I thought that scientists were people who used the scientific method to solve problems.
It was actually none of those things.
At a dinner with the president of the institute, he told us that at that institute, scientists were selected based on their degree of curiosity.
Curiosity was the word.
It didn&#39;t matter what his project was for, what mattered was how motivated he was to answer a question.
And I had never stopped to think that way.
I always thought what the projects I was doing would be for.
But, when you work motivated by your curiosity, to answer some questions that we still don&#39;t have an answer to, you go beyond the frontiers of knowledge, because you weren&#39;t predicting that result and generally the results that we don&#39;t foresee are great.
Thus, very often, real problems are solved through the result of these researches that arose from the mere and genuine curiosity of scientists.
So curiosity seemed to be the key word in this process.
But it&#39;s not just any curiosity.
There is a phrase by Eça de Queiroz that says: &quot;Curiosity is the instinct that leads some to look through the keyhole and others to discover America&quot;.
So that seemed to tell me that there were questions worth asking.
And it&#39;s about that scientist&#39;s look, about that curious look, that I would like to talk to you about.
What are the questions you want answered?
And to rescue that look, you have to go back to being a child a little.
Children are always full of questions.
After all, where do babies come from?
After all, why the blue sky, why do I have to sleep at this time and why do I have to go to the shower?
Children are always full of questions, but when we become adults, we become full of certainties.
We think we know who we are and how the world works.
And we forget to ask questions.
And then we forget that being a scientist means wanting to break paradigms; having a curiosity that is genuine and a desire to change the world.
When we turn on the TV, open social networks, the newspaper, every day, what we look at is a world full of certainties, facts: politicians in Brazil are corrupt, public health in Brazil does not work, and public education sucks; you have to be careful when you go out on the street because everything is so violent.
And we forget that certainty leaves us in our comfort zone and that it is in the questions that we grow.
If we were more of a scientist, if everyone here saw himself as a scientist, we would forget certainties and ask questions.
After all, how can I improve education in our country?
Could it be that, if I reduce social inequalities, I can interfere with urban violence?
So being a scientist means bringing more questions into the game.
And it&#39;s about these questions that I would like to share with you my current questions. Because since I started doing research, I started to be more restless.
I discovered that I could be the protagonist, and that of all these problems that we see in the newspaper, I could choose one, the one that maybe made my heart beat faster and try to create a question, thus designing an experiment, reaching some result and maybe change a little reality.
Thus came a project called Beta Scientist.
I did research all through high school, and after a while, I didn&#39;t know much what to do with that experience, other than just telling people I had done it.
I have a father at home who always said that I had to write about that, tell young people that they could live that, there were so many young people who didn&#39;t know that they could do that.
Inside me there was a question that made my heart sleep tight every day, which was what I can do with all that I&#39;ve lived.
Is it possible to transform the lives of other young people, as mine was transformed?
Once you are a scientist, you have a question, you have two choices: either you put it in the drawer and forget it, or you go and do an experiment.
And so an initiative was born called Scientist Beta, which connects young Brazilians with science.
What we do is, with a group of very engaged and committed people, we connect young people who are in high school to scientific projects.
We encourage these young people to start looking at the world with the curious eyes of a scientist.
We say they can be restless and it&#39;s okay, that&#39;s great.
That those problems they see in the world around them can be solved and that they can create a scientific project to propose some kind of solution.
What we do is offer content on how to do research, mentors from all over the country who have already done research and start accompanying these young people, and challenges.
So I ended up, somehow, answering some of my questions.
That question that was tight now had an answer: yes.
Doing a scientific project during high school, having the look of a scientist, can change the lives of these young people and is changing the lives of young Brazilians.
I can see in the future, how much this can transform a little of our reality in education, in our country.
As for these young people, more than creating projects, what we are creating are young people who create projects and create solutions.
Young people who are more protagonists and who see themselves as part not of the problem, but of the solution.
But since I am a scientist and for me what matters are the questions, the question that is inside me today is: what great thing are these young people still going to do?
How will they still surprise us?
And for you, I would like to ask what is the question that moves you?
It&#39;s about having a new look, it&#39;s about our very existence.
What is the question that sleeps and wakes up with you every day?
Could it be that you are giving vent to this question, creating an experiment that will bring you some result, a conclusion, and again new questions?
In 2010, after that succession of events of doing a project, going to a fair, not winning anything, doing another project, going to a fair and again not winning anything, there came a moment when I left score zero, which was going to fair and not win anything, and then I managed to win a place at the biggest science fair in the world, which takes place in the United States.
And being there, representing my country, completely transformed my life.
And I remember that I was entering the fair, the first time in the United States, the first time at an international event, the first time going to show what I was doing, to people who spoke another language.
And then I enter the fair and there&#39;s a big sign written: (English) &quot;Welcome to tomorrow&quot;.
Welcome to tomorrow.
And then I understood that all my search for answers, while I was doing projects, made me build a tomorrow that didn&#39;t exist.
So, what I can maybe leave you with is thinking about what tomorrow you want to build.
Listen to the questions that are within you.
Because when we seek these answers, we build a future that does not yet exist and goes beyond the borders of what we know.
We create a better world, or at least we become better people.
After all, what we are and what we&#39;ve experienced, what we know makes us who we are today.
And it&#39;s the questions, the ones we are endlessly seeking answers to, that make us who we will be tomorrow.
Thank you very much.

I&#39;m Rafa, I&#39;m part of the rap group Rafuagi, and the message I&#39;m leaving for you here today is that I believe in youth.
Does anyone believe in youth?
Do you believe in youth?
Audience: Yes!
Rafa Rafuagi: All this made me believe that, more and more, creative solutions to our country&#39;s problems emerge from the peripheries.
They emerge from the knowledge of the Global South, and this Global South made me understand and participate in several collectives during my trajectory.
There goes almost 20 years of hip hop, I started very early.
but, in that, I was able to understand that, in fact, this knowledge of the Global South gave us conditions to create true impact projects within our communities, but, much more than that, to transform into what we would like to have happened, maybe, when I was 15, and it didn&#39;t happen, it happened now, when I was 30.
But all this made me understand that believing in young people is not just looking at our navel.
And yes, look for the diversity that exists, especially in South America.
Then I found out about the Festival Hip Hop al Parque, which today is our great reference, and is currently the biggest window of dialogue that exists in Latin America, especially with peripheral youth.
Every day there are 100,000 people at this festival in Bogotá, Colombia.
We were there in 2014, bringing this experience, and made us understand the possibility that exists, not only within hip hop, but precisely in these forms of dialogue that we have.
In addition, another project that we bring as a reference is Comuna 13, in Medellín, which made Medellín a reference in public policies, not only in Colombia, but mainly in South America as a whole.
Then, in 2012, I met a friend named Boaventura de Sousa Santos, he is a sociologist, we have been working together ever since, and, on that occasion, he asked me this: &quot;Look, Rafa.
If one day you could meet someone, who would that person be?&quot;
Then I quoted: &quot;Oh, professor, Jay-Z.
Swap an idea with Jay-Z.&quot;
Then everyone laughed: &quot;No, Rafa is there in Esteio, Rio Grande do Sul, Jay-Z is there in Brooklyn, in New York...&quot; And the teacher: &quot;There is a theory that we are five steps away from from anyone in the world&quot;.
&quot;What do you mean, teacher?
What are you talking about?&quot;
Five steps: Rafa is a friend of Boaventura, Boaventura is a friend of Kenny West, Kenny West is a friend of Jay-Z, I was three people away from Jay-Z.
Everyone was stunned, not because I was three people away from Jay-Z, much more because Boaventura was Kenny West&#39;s friend, they thought so... (Laughter) But that&#39;s okay, right?
What did he mean to tell me, in practice?
That things weren&#39;t as impossible as they seemed, if we articulated in a network, collectively, together, truly.
Now, for that, we started to think: what can we join the guys with, that will work?
In 2017, we created the Hip Hop House of Culture in Esteio, the first in the state of Rio Grande do Sul and the largest in Latin America.
There are 1,700 m² in space, and this house is located in Esteio, and I invite you to discover it.
More than 10,000 young people have passed through there in a year and a half; we always calculate: considering the average Brazilian family of four people, more than 40,000 people have been directly or indirectly impacted by ideas of solidarity and the idea of collective growth through the citizenship and professional training that these young people receive .
In 2018, we came up with an idea that is the UPMS, which now in 2019 has become a reality, the Popular University of Social Movements, which at this very moment is temporarily taking place at the headquarters of the FMP, Fundação Escola Superior do Ministério Público, here in Porto Alegre, which seeks, through popular knowledge, to make a new form of education emerge within the academy, but, much more than that, this ecology of knowledge, as we are doing here today, which is the exchange, it is sharing information for collective growth.
These projects are part of a tripod of projects that we believe in as a real source of change for our communities.
The third is the Hip Hop Museum.
This museum does not yet exist, it will be created in 2022 in the Bronx, in the United States, but we are looking for this reference to also bring this experience to Brazil, precisely so that our memories, all these lines that passed through here and spoke of memories, be eternalized and can, yes, inspire future generations, so that we can actually have a much greater awareness as our self, but, much more than that, respect and a fairer society for all.
Through this, we can already see the result in practice, and this result goes beyond numbers.
And we say that this result generated engagement of people for all these causes, whether artists, like those who are here with me in the photo, like Thaíde, Afrika Bambaataa, but so many other names that we can say that participated and participate actively of this collective construction.
But actors and actresses from organizations, from institutions, such as the Labor Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office, through the allocation of TAC resources to projects, be it the ILO, the International Labor Organization, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year, or the UN Woman, through He for She.
There are several actors and actresses involved, precisely understanding and understanding that these projects are strategically essential for the practical transformation that we need in our society.
With that, we see that this network of partnership agreements leads us to a logical reasoning, which is what we believe, which is prevention.
I could give several examples of prevention here.
Could someone give me an example of what prevention is?
Is educating for diversity prevention?
Is giving equal conditions and opportunities prevention?
Creating public policies is prevention?
We believe in that too.
We believe in this and, because we believe in this, we have sought to understand this larger system that, many times, as the AD [Junior] brought, puts young black people incarcerated en masse... And, for example, here in Fase do Rio Grande do Sul, there are currently 1,263 inmates.
If we did a basic calculation, today each young person who is interned in Fase costs the state of Rio Grande do Sul R$ 12,000 a month.
If we made an account of a thousand young people, today these thousand young people, per year, would cost R$ 144 million.
With R$144 million, we keep 480 Houses of Hip Hop Culture open, serving 4,000 young people a year.
This gives a public contemplated by a public policy of 1 million and 920 thousand young people, which constitutes almost 100% of the young population of the state of Rio Grande do Sul.
If we do that calculation of multiplying by four, the family, there would be more than 7.6 million people impacted by a public policy of inclusion.
It would be almost 100% of the population of the state of Rio Grande do Sul.
And Rio Grande do Sul which, by the way, is the most racist state in Brazil.
But, for that to happen, it is necessary that this comrade, this young man, when he leaves the Phase, does not relapse, he does not return to the Phase, because in this way, he is also feeding back the system.
And, in fact, this feature keeps being used precisely for that function.
But, much more than that, it is understanding that, when this young person leaves, it is necessary for our communities to be prepared for this welcome.
Because leaving and going back to sameness, in fact, nothing will help.
And, today, there is a lack of public policies, a lack of respect, a series of things are lacking within the communities that, unfortunately, increasingly keep these young people within the system.
Now, for that, we saw that all these results, and this is what I want to share with you here today, about these results, in fact, in practice, they only happened because, in fact, there was engagement and there was strategic thinking network.
Today we operate in a logic of multiplication of three, which is precisely this exchange through the sharing of information, of an idea.
For example, we started a network with 100 people, and in this network, the idea was: I learned something, I&#39;m going to pass it on to three other people.
These three learned, they will pass to six.
These six, to nine and so on.
In this account, if we multiplied these 100, with 3 we would get 300, these 300 with 6 would give 1,800, 1,800 by 9 would give 16,200.
But this, in practice, happened and showed us what?
That today our South America has a population of 587 million people.
I speak exclusively of South America, our country being obviously Brazil, the largest country on our continent.
But, if we had the possibility of dialogue with these people, how could we do this in practice?
We started to think that too.
And this logic of multiplying by three, it came at a good time, as we managed to achieve this information sharing faster and faster, whether with projects, with examples, with attitudes, or in any other way, to people understand that, today, my great goal in life, as well as my partners, who are running together, my partners too, is, in the next ten years, for us to dialogue with half of the continent of South America; 300 million people, so that our continent becomes ever stronger, more in solidarity with each other, a continent totally free from North American ties, European ties, but, much more than that, a continent that we can , in fact, to say that this continent makes a difference in the world insofar as people live with dignity.
And that, when I speak of dignity, is precisely what this mathematical account managed to send us, we are already reaching a very expressive number, but I challenge you: today you heard many people, many ideas, many feelings, loaded in truth.
Who would be, for example, the three people that you would leave here and share what you heard or learned or liked, here today?
Can you shout out some people&#39;s names?
Who were the three people?
Is it that hard?
Don&#39;t you have three people in your network?
The names, I want names, who are these people?
Shout out!
(Screams from the audience) José, Ana, Felipe, Tiago... (Screams) Bruna, Mari, João... All these people.
It is important that we understand that these people are also in the same fight and often what is missing is information.
I usually say that information is power, and the truth is revolutionary.
Now, we need to understand that, more and more, we have to move from theory to practice.
The issues are urgent.
The causes are emerging.
And in that, for every speech, there has to be an action.
For every action there must be a new idea.
So that we can truly see this transformation in practice, but, much more than that, to be able to cause new forms of resistance and new forms of proposing projects to emerge within the peripheries.
My mother told me a sentence once, and I&#39;ll end here with that sentence.
Unfortunately my mother couldn&#39;t be here today, but she will certainly be watching me, and she says to me: &quot;Look, it&#39;s not enough for us to be happy.
Others must not be disgraced.&quot;
And I&#39;m going to take a good look at that camera, because in a month I&#39;m going to be a father and I&#39;m going to say: &quot;Augusto, it&#39;s for you, for you that I&#39;m fighting and for all of us too&quot;.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) (Cheers)
So, I&#39;m going to start here talking about a love letter from Ademar Bogo in which he talks about education.
He says it more or less like this: that to educate comes from the Latin &quot;to take from within&quot;; but the material and elements for education all come to us from outside.
These things when they are outside, when they enter, they become consciousness and when they leave, they should at least become actions.
So taking out is an illustrative gesture.
What is sought is first removed from within the consciences.
For this reason, education has a valid function for the whole of life, which is to awaken dormant actions and remove from within us, actions of rebellion and restlessness so that we do not settle down.
When I was invited to come and speak here about education, the first thing I did was talk to a history teacher, a friend of mine, and watch some lectures about it.
In this, we noticed how much is said about how the current model of education does not work.
But what is it to be right?
And what do you want it to work for?
One so-called secondary education reform explicitly wants it to work for training aimed at the labor market.
Train cheap labor.
I, like the occupation people, also think that the current model of education does not work, but our idea of success is very different.
For us, studying goes far beyond getting a job, earning money to consume non-stop and continuing to support the structures of this system.
(Applause) (Cheers) We hope that education, that the relationship with knowledge, is a means for us to find out about the world and find out about society, and not to reproduce it, but to consciously participate in its transformations .
But in the society in which we live, wanting this is a danger, and more and more, we see those who are fighting for this type of &quot;dangerous&quot; education being treated with bombs and gags; Anyone who is concerned with an education that helps to think, to problematize, and that uses the sciences to deconstruct prejudices, is suffering reprisals, is suffering persecution, and laws are being instituted against them.
Not that it is something new that the laws do not aim to benefit the working class, but they want to make it impossible for very important issues to be debated at school.
School is an environment where we spend a lot of time in our lives, where we have our first relationships with other individuals.
So, consequently, it should be there that we learn to deal with these other individuals and, above all, respect them within each individuality.
But, like, in the occupations, when we talked about these issues of our daily life, which were frequently debated, we respected all thoughts, because we think and agree that all people have different knowledge and none of this knowledge is more or less important than the other.
There was a guy who had thought that for a long time, and he is internationally recognized, but within this crazy situation we are living in, even he is being persecuted.
This guy is Paulo Freire, and he used to say... (Applause) that education doesn&#39;t change the world, education changes people, and people change the world.
He also thought that the student is not a warehouse where the teacher has to dump things, and he has to absorb everything.
He believed, as I did, that the student and teacher have to work together and learn new possibilities, and discover new things in life; and he saw education as a liberating pedagogy.
All of this may seem like utopia, but I&#39;m not alone, and the occupations have shown me that.
Utopias are what help us to walk, because even without knowing where we are going, they help us to move forward.
I would like to dedicate this speech to everyone, all of them... (Applause) who are still walking and building this utopia together with me and who fight for an education, for a fairer society, and who suffer reprisals for occupying the spaces that are trying to take from us: from the people who struggle.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) (Cheers)
What is a hacker?
A hacker is a person who is deeply dedicated to studying and modifying systems, devices, programs.
And thanks to that, he manages to go beyond what is considered normal, within standard functioning.
And he even manages to overcome barriers, which the creator himself thought were resolved.
There are no hackers only bad.
There are hackers, for example, who work for the development of free software.
These people work in communities, in networks and they are usually moved by culture, ideology and motivations.
Culture, ideology and motivations.
So, inspired by that, I come to bring you today a proposal for us to &quot;hack&quot; life.
We hack that set of attitudes and prejudices that seem &quot;normal&quot;, which were created by the system and which remain there.
I propose hacking life so that we can break prejudice and study what we want, work on what we want, be what we want; create whatever you want, marry whoever you want, have sex with whoever you want.
Because if we live today in a world of such advanced technology, would we want to continue in a world of backward methodology?
Of course!
And we women can mostly hack sexist software, in the neighborhood, in society, in schools, at home, at work.
If we stop to think about work, how many times do women come across aggressive men, who belittle their opinion, who interrupt them successively; interrupt once, twice, interrupt again and again and again.
So what we thought, me and my team at the agency, was that we could somehow help change this reality in the work environment.
Can we knock out this problem?
Maybe not, but we can throw a little punch.
Because sometimes a small screw stops a plane from flying.
And with small punches, a series of small punches, we can win a fight.
When I look at this data here, I keep thinking how hard the reality of women is, right?
These data here, by the way, remind me a lot of a phrase by Glauber Rocha that said the following: &quot;The function of the prophet is to prophesy, and not to hit&quot;.
Far be it from me to say that the UN and McKinsey predicted these numbers, they must have studied a lot to be able to see the trends and project these numbers, but Glauber&#39;s phrase takes on meaning from the moment when, knowing that the projected data are these, we should work harder and advance to reduce the time in which this reality will be changed.
When I look at this data here, I wonder if people know that there are reports and data that show that a work environment that has diversity is a more tolerant, fairer, more creative environment.
I wonder if people know that there are reports from the World Bank, the UN, McKinsey itself showing that in an environment where there is diversity, there is more productivity and, consequently, better results.
This directly impacts the results of companies.
But why is prejudice so insistent on persisting?
So, when we see these phrases here...
How many times have many women heard things like this in their work environment?
Lots of.
Surely you know someone, or you yourself must have heard things like that in the work environment.
Is not true?
Well, we decided to study one of the phenomena linked to prejudice against women in the workplace and which has to do with my area of expertise, which is communication.
So, there are several phenomena of male prejudice against women and &quot;manterupting&quot; is one of them.
The &quot;manterupting&quot; is nothing more than that persistent habit of the man to interrupt the women in the meeting.
And this is so strong, it&#39;s something so universal, that there are data that show that 75% of meetings are dominated by the male voice.
Women are interrupted two and a half times more often than men in meetings.
So we thought: what will be the small punch that we can throw at this problem?
So we created this &quot;app&quot; here, which is on a device that everyone has in their hands, the cell phone.
It was released on the 8th of March this year.
The woman calibrates her own voice, then turns on the device and leaves it on the table and throughout a meeting or session the app will automatically measure how many times that woman was interrupted by male voices.
It&#39;s a tool... (Applause) It&#39;s a very high precision tool.
And people often ask me: &quot;Ah, but how does the app know if it&#39;s a man&#39;s voice or a woman&#39;s voice?
What if it&#39;s like this, Ana Carolina talking to Anderson Silva?&quot;
(Laughter) &quot;Does he know too?&quot;
He knows.
Do you know why he knows?
Because it&#39;s a physical issue.
The morphology of the vocal cords of men and women are different, so it is the volume level that a female voice reaches, which goes more or less up to 180Hz, even if it is a low voice, and from 180Hz onwards it is a male voice, therefore, Anderson and Ana Carolina can talk and it will work.
Well, a super simple tool to use, in everyone&#39;s hands, that has received extraordinary global support.
These here are posters promoting the app.
There were artists, men and women, from more than 80 countries, who spontaneously made these posters, which were the promotional pieces.
As you can see, it is a male hand silencing a woman.
In addition, we gained a lot of support from the media around the world.
On North American free-to-air TV alone, our app appeared four times.
In fact, in one of the programs, the presenter used it live, without her colleagues knowing, and she was interrupted 17 times.
And she showed it live on air.
It&#39;s all there on our website, it&#39;s all on YouTube, you can see everything there.
Also, thanks to a note that came out in the New York Times, we got this panel in Times Square.
For a month, we got free advertising to promote the app in the United States, where the problem is extremely serious.
In fact, it was the place where the app had the most downloads.
Here too, communication entrepreneurs in Brazil helped us a lot, also with donated media.
I thought it was really cool because both the owner of the Times Square panels and companies in Brazil dedicate spaces to non-profit companies and our app is free, not for profit.
And finally, this &quot;dashboard&quot;, which was our ultimate goal.
There are universities that have been studying this subject for some time and on Monday, we are going to open the data from this &quot;dashboard&quot;, from these months of use, to these universities that are already studying the phenomenon, to the press and you will also be able to access it; choose the countries, make the correlation.
And we&#39;re going to show you, first hand, in a little while the first disclosure data for this &quot;dashboard&quot;.
But I would like to draw your attention to the following: Brazilians must be very proud of work like this because, according to the UN, there are 198 countries in the world.
Our app was downloaded at 154 and used at 145; on a planet where there are only ten countries led by women.
So we should be proud of the reach and grandeur that a small app has achieved, developed by Brazilian talent, entirely in Brazil.
So this is the first data that you are seeing firsthand; of app usage, these are the countries where women were interrupted the most.
There are countries where women have been interrupted the least.
People also always ask me: &quot;But what about Brazil?&quot;
Brazil is halfway there.
On Monday you will go to the website and you will be able to check all the data for Brazil.
So, these are our little punches for us to win this fight.
Did we get a knockout?
No.
But we will keep fighting so that one day things like this disappear.
And we want to count on you.
Shall we hack this problem?
(Applause) (Cheers) Thank you.
(Applause) (Cheers) Thank you.
Hi, my name is Gabriel Vilanova.
Today I came to present about the new treatments against cancer.
New treatments can emerge at any time.
And monotherapy [is] the treatment that stimulates the immune system to fight the tumor.
The Zika virus is capable of killing irregular brain cells, and these cells are especially resistant to conventional treatments.
Immunotherapy is used in some successful treatments.
The use of the Zika virus was only tested in rats and mice.
And the tumor was significantly reduced.
How to prevent?
It is important to maintain a healthy diet, rich in vitamins, in addition to not smoking, drinking alcohol, and avoiding radiation.
Success?
Yes, we have these treatments.
The problem is authorization from the Ministry of Health.
If this does not happen, the use of these drugs is prohibited.
But there is another treatment.
It&#39;s called friendship.
That year, in the first semester, I had cancer and I stayed out of school for the entire first semester, but I communicated with all my friends.
And that was the best treatment.
Thanks.
(Applause)
When I was little and I was in school, in what was elementary school at the time and today we call elementary school, I studied at a school run by nuns in the interior of Rio Grande do Sul.
This school operated as a semi-boarding school for poor girls.
So these girls paid a symbolic monthly fee and attended school full time.
All the semi-internal girls were black.
We went to school together and grew up together, and I knew they were poor, but I didn&#39;t, at the time, have much of an idea of what that really meant.
Mariana, my best friend, was a semi-intern and, in my mind, we were absolutely equal, entirely equal.
Even I couldn&#39;t understand why she could stay at school after school ended and I couldn&#39;t.
I also wanted to play with my friends and learn how to sew, iron and clean, in short, how they did it.
This school of mine, unfortunately, only had elementary education.
Then, in high school, I had to change schools.
Because I left one of the cheapest and most diverse schools in my city and went to study at the best and most expensive school in Pelotas, most likely the &quot;whitest&quot; one too.
In the entire school, I had two black classmates, and it was only when I realized that that I understood that Mariana and I lived in entirely different worlds.
We grew up together, but in reality, we never really had the same opportunities.
Well then.
I left high school, graduated, entered a public university, graduated in psychology and went on to do a master&#39;s degree.
During my master&#39;s degree, I spent four months living in Angola, where I carried out research on education and the rights of children and adolescents.
When I was in Angola, one fine night, I was talking to a researcher friend, also Brazilian, Cleia is her name, and I asked Cleia why she was in favor of racial quotas for access to higher education.
I remember that Cleia took a deep breath and she started her explanation by saying: &quot;Airi, the problem is that, in Brazil, poverty has color.&quot;
The conversation lasted into the night, but Cleia&#39;s phrase kept ringing in my head.
I returned to Brazil, finished my master&#39;s degree, started my doctorate, and while I was deciding what topic to study for my doctorate, while I was deciding between the various possible topics, Cleia&#39;s phrase kept reverberating in my head: &quot;In Brazil, poverty has color.&quot;
I started to think a lot about my friend Mariana and, again, how we were always together, but we never had the same possibilities.
It was then, with the insistence of Cleia&#39;s phrase and Mariana&#39;s face in my head, that I decided that I wanted to study racial prejudice, because, after all, if poverty has color, then prejudice needs to be studied.
Here I would like to just make a parenthesis, with you, to explain that there is a difference between racial prejudice and racial discrimination.
So, in academic terminology, we use the term prejudice to talk about affective issues.
So, prejudice is related, for example, to liking or not liking a certain social group.
Discrimination is a behavior, it is treating someone differently because that person is part of a certain group.
So it would be, for example, treating a person differently just because of the color of their skin.
All right then.
Close parenthesis.
I decided that I wanted to study racial prejudice, and the next step was to see how psychology people are studying racial prejudice in Brazil.
And when I went to do this research, I discovered something that intrigued me a lot: I discovered that Brazilian researchers, when studying racial prejudice, have mainly used interviews and questionnaires as instruments.
This reason intrigued me because it is related to a very specific phenomenon, but, to exemplify, I am going to ask you a question, and I want you to answer me very honestly.
Could it be?
Yes?
Could it be?
OK.
So, raise your hand, people, please, who in this room likes white people more than black people.
No?
Nobody?
Wow, what a wonder, huh!
Do you understand then why I was intrigued to discover that people in Brazil were mainly using interviews and questionnaires to study racial prejudice?
Personnel, interviews, and questionnaires are explicit measures of attitude.
Explicit measures of attitude are usually based on self-reports, they are self-report measures, that is, people can deliberately control their responses, as you did here.
So, this phenomenon that happened here in the room and that happens in the most varied surveys is called &quot;social desirability&quot;.
Social desirability is nothing more than the following: it is when the research participant answers not necessarily what he thinks or feels, but what he thinks the researcher wants to hear.
And social desirability, as I said, happens in the most varied surveys, but mainly in those that deal with slightly more thorny themes, such as, for example, racial prejudice.
Just for you to have an idea, if we used only interviews and questionnaires, only explicit measures, to study the development of racial prejudice in children, do you know what we would find?
We would find that, around the age of four or five, children respond with what they really feel.
So, they would tell you if they like white people or black people more.
Around eight, nine years old, children learn that some things they cannot say, that some things cannot be said.
So when I asked them that question, they would answer me exactly what you answered.
They would say, &quot;No, I like everyone the same.
I prefer neither whites nor blacks, because, after all, we are all the same.&quot;
So, if we put this on a graph, the curve for the development of explicit racial prejudice increases in the first years of life.
At a certain point, around eight or nine years old, it decreases and then stabilizes.
At that point where it stabilizes, most people respond, &quot;No, I don&#39;t prefer either one.
I like everyone exactly the same.&quot;
But do you think this data is really reliable?
Do you think I can leave this room, leave this TEDx, and say that nobody, none of these 100 people who are here in this room like white people more than black people?
Of course not?
I work in science.
I need data that is reliable.
But how to solve this problem then?
How to measure racial prejudice without having to ask people directly if they like white people more than black people?
Fortunately, some researchers have been studying this topic for some time now, a few decades ago, and they have developed a way of studying prejudice without having to ask people directly if they like white people more than black people.
These measures they developed are called implicit measures of attitude, and they don&#39;t allow the participant to deliberately control his answer, as happens when we ask him directly.
These implicit measures of attitude are mainly based on reaction time, which is the time it takes a person to press a button, or to issue a certain response.
One of the most widely used implicit measures worldwide is the Implicit Association Test, or IAT.
The IAT is a super simple categorization task.
It consists of the following: it is a task performed on the computer.
So, we show the participant a picture of a child and ask him to give the fastest answer he can.
So, in the first block, we present a photo of a child and the participant&#39;s task is super simple: he needs to say if this is a white child or a black child.
So, to give that answer, he pushes buttons.
You saw that there are children&#39;s drawings up there.
It has a drawing of a white child and a drawing of a black child.
Then, he needs to press the corresponding button to issue his answer.
This is the first block.
In the second block, instead of seeing pictures of children, the person sees images that are positive or negative, and the layout of categories and buttons is exactly the same.
In the third block, things start to get interesting, because now images of children, photos of children, and images that are positive or negative appear mixed.
See that we have, on each side of the screen, two categories.
Then, the participant uses the same button to give a different answer to two different categories.
The logic here, folks, is the following: if the participant associates white people with positive characteristics, he will press the button faster to give me the answer when white and positive are on the same side of the screen, when we are going to use the same button for these two categories.
If two categories that he sees as opposites are on the same side of the screen, such as, for example, black and positive, and white and negative, as in the case of a prejudiced person, the participant will take a little longer to press the button because he you will need to think about what the right answer is.
Guys, it&#39;s a matter of hundredths of a second, but it&#39;s enough.
So, this reaction time measured by the IAT provides us with a measure of preference for one racial group or the other.
Better than asking people directly if they prefer white people or black people, don&#39;t you think?
I think.
So, for my PhD, I decided that I wanted to study the development of implicit racial bias in children.
I know, you&#39;re going to say, or you might be thinking, that it&#39;s the family&#39;s fault; or rather, that it is the mother&#39;s fault; everyone thinks it&#39;s always the mother&#39;s fault.
But I&#39;m a researcher, I&#39;m a scientist, and I wanted to investigate this question further.
So, I decided that I really wanted to study the development of implicit prejudice in children, which is a topic that is much studied around the world, much studied internationally, but little studied in Brazil, and studies are usually carried out with adult participants and using, as I told you, explicit measures of attitude.
You know that Brazil is a country with enormous racial diversity and continental dimensions.
So, what we decided to do was to study the development of prejudice in white, brown and black children from two cities with very different characteristics, both in terms of the racial composition of the population and in terms of cultural characteristics, which are Porto Alegre, in Rio Grande do Sul, and Salvador, Bahia.
Guys, the results that we found with our research - we used two implicit measures of attitude and five explicit measures - were that they confirmed the results of international studies, which say that regardless of the child&#39;s skin color, regardless of the color of the skin of the person, in our case, regardless of whether the child is white, brown or black, the levels of preference for whites over blacks are very high, and they do not change with age.
Levels of preference for whites over blacks do not change over human development.
Here, I would like to return to you again with the fact that a person having a preference for whites over blacks does not necessarily mean that he or she exhibits discriminatory behavior towards blacks, because, as I said to you, prejudice and discrimination are different concepts.
But do you understand how important this result is?
Do you understand how strong it is for me to say that, regardless of age, children already have high levels of preference for whites and that this does not change throughout development?
If we were to put this on a graph, instead of having that curve of explicit prejudice that I showed you, in the implicit prejudice we have this straight line, considering that age is down there.
So, folks, what this means, what these results mean to us, is that maybe it&#39;s not enough for us to keep saying, repeating to children that they need to like everyone the same way because we are all the same.
Of course, talking about racial equality is important, but more important than talking is putting it into practice.
So, maybe what these results are telling us is that we need to turn our attention and our investments to fighting racial discrimination, to fighting discriminatory behaviors, which are, after all, what makes us have such high social inequality.
And who knows like this, if we manage to reduce this inequality, maybe growing in a world where there is not so much difference between racial groups, so much social and economic difference, who knows growing in a world where a racial group is not so more valued than the other, these children already start from an early age, in the future, to show low levels, or almost zero, of preference for whites in relation to blacks.
After I left that first school of mine, I never saw my friend Mariana again.
I don&#39;t know what ended up with her, and I confess to you that I blame myself a lot for always having had all the opportunities she never had.
My doctoral thesis is an attempt to ensure that, in the future, other Marianas do not have their lives defined according to the color of their skin.
My thesis is an attempt to make science contribute to the understanding of prejudice and to the reduction of racial discrimination.
My thesis is an attempt to ensure that, in the future, we have the same opportunities and that we are, therefore, really all equal.
Thanks.
(Applause)
We don&#39;t know everything about nutrition.
But, more than lack of knowledge in this area, what exists is a lot of misinformation, a lot of noise and people who distort scientific evidence, basically to sell a certain message or, eventually, a certain product.
Today, my role is to try to help you demystify some of the arguments used in this area.
And for that, we&#39;re going to use Maria.
Maria was a happy, thin young woman who, unfortunately, gained weight.
She gained weight, because she got pregnant, because she had a disease because she worked too much and didn&#39;t have time to take care of herself and she was very unhappy, with low self-esteem.
One day I was watching television and the guru appeared.
These gurus go to television to present their fad diets, they have a very philosophical and appealing speech but, usually, empty of content and full of logical fallacies such as, for example, the so-called fallacy of authority.
They love to say that the Nobel Prize for this, the Nobel Prize for that...
Basically, to validate your arguments.
We also have the fallacy of antiquity, that is, saying that a certain product is good because it was already used in the time of Hippocrates.
We have references or the fallacy of popularity, saying that &quot;thousands of people have lost weight with my diet&quot;, &quot;I have sold hundreds of thousands of books&quot;, &quot;I have a six month waiting list for my appointment&quot;.
And they also love using testimonials.
A lady who, for example, weighed 100 kilos and goes with the guru on television to testify that, in fact, she lost 40 kilos and became much thinner, that diet is spectacular.
The scientific validity of these arguments is zero, for us this does not work.
In the middle of this conversation, Maria noticed this sentence: &quot;Let medicine be your food and let food be your medicine&quot; said by Hippocrates about 2500 years ago — supposedly said by Hippocrates.
This sentence is a bit pernicious because it makes you think that we can use food to cure diseases, doesn&#39;t it?
In some circumstances, in fact, food can help us to control some diseases and even stop some diseases from having symptoms.
But, then, there are those who take this concept to the extreme and think that they can treat autism, treat cancer, treat serious rheumatological diseases just with food.
I do not mean that we, health professionals, do not value food.
Obviously yes.
By the way, in 2015, an article was published in The Lancet with the aggregation of data from 188 countries, in which food was placed first as a risk factor for premature death.
So food is important, there&#39;s no doubt about that.
What can we do to actually contradict these data?
If you ask the audience, most of you know what healthy eating is.
I don&#39;t understand why we have to constantly reinvent the wheel.
Everyone knows you have to eat more fruits, more vegetables, more whole grains and nuts.
Dairy products in moderation, avoid red meats, processed meats and sugary drinks.
This is the basis.
The most important part of this message is that, in order to have a healthy diet, there is no single path.
There are several paths.
And, most importantly, you don&#39;t have to eliminate any food groups.
Going back to the phrase &quot;that the medicine be your food and the food be your medicine&quot;, already in the time of Hippocrates he clearly distinguished what was a medicine and what was a food.
There was no such confusion.
And someone took the trouble to read the Hippocratic Body, which is about 60 books written by Hippocrates and his disciples, and came to the conclusion that this sentence was never said by Hippocrates.
(Laughter) So, if you want a sentence that is closer to reality, I leave you my sentence: &quot;Food is food... (Laughter) &quot;... medicine is medicine&quot;.
(Applause) But Maria, poor thing, doesn&#39;t know anything about this, does she?
And consulted the guru.
The guru told him three things: &quot;The energy balance is dead.
&quot;With my diet, you don&#39;t have to cut calories.
&quot;The obesity epidemic was caused by international recommendations &quot;which recommended cutting fat&quot;.
But when we look at the data, what do we see?
We observed that the increase in obesity is practically overlapping with the increase in calorie consumption.
Around the year 2000, there was a decrease in the consumption of carbohydrates and an increase in the consumption of fats.
And there was no change in obesity.
A calorie is still a calorie and the energy balance is in good health.
Anyway, Maria lost weight, even though she didn&#39;t realize it, she made caloric restriction.
But, after some time, he gained weight again.
This is very frequent.
Why?
We know that, to lose weight, as long as there is caloric restriction, all diets are equally effective.
The most important thing is adherence to the diet.
What I usually tell people is to choose a diet that you are comfortable with and that you can stick to for the long term.
When Maria gained weight, she was sad, with low self-esteem and went to the Internet.
With the Internet we have a serious problem because they follow the logic of &quot;if I eat, then I&#39;m an expert in food&quot;.
(Laughter) And adding to that, reading some articles on Google, then we have Dr. Google.
These doctors are relatively problematic because they are people who have little knowledge of the subject, in the scientific area, but have a perception of their knowledge that is much higher than what they really know and it is very difficult to talk to them.
This is called the Dunning-Kruger Effect.
What did the licensed doctors at Google tell Maria?
&quot;Maria, listen to what these gentlemen have to say to you.
&quot;The nutrologist, the functional nutritionist, &quot;the &#39;wellness coach&#39;, the orthomolecular nutritionist, &quot;the famous &#39;blogger&#39; or &#39;vlogger&#39; and the &#39;nutrichef&#39; &quot;.
Which I add and what I call alternative nutritionists.
Why do I have this designation?
Because what they usually say is bullshit.
Anyway, Maria didn&#39;t know this and consulted an alternative nutritionist.
He explained his adventures, he had lost weight, he had put on weight again, he was very unhappy, very down.
The nutritionist said to her: &quot;Look, let&#39;s do some food intolerance tests&quot; to find out which foods are most in line with &quot;your profile, Maria&quot;.
We have two types of tests.
Laboratory tests, in which we measure the amount of antibodies in the blood and, supposedly, this tells us that the person is or is not intolerant to that food but, in reality, when there are antibodies in the blood against certain foods, what tells us is that the person was exposed to that food.
The Portuguese Society of Allergology and Immunology came to denounce these tests, saying that they had no scientific basis and that asking for these tests was bad practice.
Then we have the famous Vega test, which, due to its name, many people will not recognize, but these are those food intolerance tests carried out in pharmacies, in some clinics that can detect food intolerance in 700 or 800 foods.
These tests are based on the concept of energetics/bioresonance, that is, our body has a base vibration and, if there is a change, they are able to detect that the person is intolerant to a certain food.
We know, at least since 1991, that these tests don&#39;t work, they don&#39;t have any scientific validity and, even so, they continue to be performed today.
This is not problematic because the mantras of alternative nutritionists are almost all the same.
&quot;Milk is poison.
Gluten is poison.&quot;
&quot;Transgenics are poison&quot;.
&quot;Food is full of pesticides and toxics.&quot;
&quot;We have to alkalize the body, &quot;eat organic food, &quot;make dietary supplements &quot;and do &#39;Detox&#39;&quot;.
Milk has been demonized recently and indeed there has been a decrease in milk consumption but, outside of people who are intolerant or allergic to milk, milk is a great food.
It&#39;s cheap, it&#39;s much more nutritious than the alternatives, it doesn&#39;t have antibiotics.
It has been shown to reduce the risk of childhood obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
It has no impact on overall mortality.
Then we have &quot;gluten is poison&quot;.
In fact, there are people who have celiac disease.
But we don&#39;t even know if being gluten intolerant is a real pathology.
Incidentally, a recent study has shown that people can eventually react to fructans, which is a substance that also exists in cereals.
But this is still very early science.
What do we know relatively well?
It&#39;s just that when people replace their gluten-containing diet with gluten-free alternatives, the risk of having diabetes and cardiovascular pathologies increases because the alternatives are worse.
Therefore, the person is trying to be healthy, and, deep down, he will get sicker.
Then we have transgenics, genetically altered foods.
There won&#39;t be any food you put on the table that hasn&#39;t been genetically altered.
In fact, people usually rebel against genetic manipulation that is more targeted and safer.
But this revolt in the population does not exist in the scientific community.
In the scientific community, we know that transgenics are safe, have less mycotoxins, which are substances with carcinogenic potential, usually use less pesticides and have the halo effect, that is, even non-transgenic crops on the periphery of transgenic crops need less pesticides, and they are more environmentally beneficial because they can produce more food with fewer resources.
This discussion that we sometimes see about transgenics, for Western society it is not very problematic because we have access to a lot of food.
But in underdeveloped countries it is a very serious problem.
The case of golden rice, which is rice enriched with vitamin A, which is having a great controversy because they don&#39;t want it to be put on the market.
But this golden rice has the potential to save thousands, hundreds of thousands of children from blindness and death.
Then we have the biological.
Here things get a little complicated.
Most people — there are surveys that point to around 95% — think that organic food does not use pesticides, which is wrong.
Organic food — or organic farming — uses pesticides, but they are natural pesticides.
The problem is that natural doesn&#39;t tell us if it&#39;s healthier, if it&#39;s safer or less toxic.
In fact, there are pesticides used in organic farming, such as copper sulphate, which are much more toxic than glyphosate.
And copper sulfate was approved shortly after glyphosate.
It went through the same process.
And no one has heard of a copper sulfate challenge.
There are no studies that show that eating organic food is safer and healthier for people.
There are some nutritional differences, in fact, but in terms of health, there are no studies that demonstrate the advantages of eating organic.
Also, another myth in this area is that organic farming is environmentally better.
The issue is that, if everyone ate organic food, we would have to use 20 to 25% more land for cultivation, which would lead to a great destruction of natural &quot;habitats&quot; and deforestation.
Therefore, in terms of environmental impact, organic foods are not innocent.
In addition, they are more expensive — around 70% — and, as we have seen, without major associated advantages.
Then we have the trend of alkalizing the body (Laughter) that, at the moment, everyone writes books about this.
This is basic science, that is, the body has a pH between 7.35 and 7.45.
It is not possible to alkalize the body with food, nor is it desirable.
Incidentally, the organism has several mechanisms precisely to prevent this from happening, be it the intestine, be it the lungs, be it the kidneys, be it the saliva.
Therefore, I don&#39;t want a more alkaline or more acidic body, because I know that when I have a more alkaline body, I will be extremely sick and possibly die.
(Laughter) So forget about alkalizing the body.
About food supplements, this is a multi-million market, I think it will reach 278 billion in 2024, and, as Marçal said, with several problems.
It is not properly regulated, it has contaminated, adulterated products, they do not respect the quantity shown on the label and, even if there were not these problems, they were all spectacular, in fact, most are useless, except in specific situations, for example, the issue of folic acid and iodine in pregnant women or iron in iron deficiency anemia.
Other than these specific examples, they don&#39;t matter.
The funniest thing is the antioxidants.
In fact, antioxidants, some time ago, promised more health, prevented aging and then it was concluded that, after all, they increased mortality.
In other words, people were spending money to die faster.
(Laughter) Then we have the famous &quot;detox&quot;.
that come in every shape imaginable, teas, pills, juices, enemas, eco-washes, you name it.
But what you have to ask is: What toxics do these detoxifiers remove from the organism?
And, if they remove some toxic substance, how does it act?
Most detox methods cannot answer these two questions.
And even if you do, we know there are no controlled studies that show benefits of detoxing.
Therefore, Maria, at the end of this walk, came to the end uninformed, unhappy because, possibly, she cut out on some foods that she even liked to eat, and certainly poorer because she spent money on completely useless things.
Worse, Maria could end up with a psychological illness called orthorexia.
which is an obsession with eating healthy.
I call it a disease disguised as a virtue.
The person spends many hours a day thinking about what they are going to eat, they begin to isolate themselves socially because, in fact, they have very severe food restrictions and, later, they start to have nutritional problems with avitaminosis, serious nutritional deficiencies that can lead the death.
Therefore, what I would ask of you is not to be like Mary.
If you are chubby and want to lose weight, look for someone who follows scientific evidence and not the latest fad diet.
Look for someone who does food re-education, someone who changes lifestyles.
Look for someone who tells you directly that there are no shortcuts to achieving your goals.
Thank you very much.

Hi, my name is Julia Coltacci, I&#39;m ten years old and today I&#39;m going to talk about recycling.
It is common to use plastic cups in schools, parks, malls, in various places.
Have you ever stopped to count how many cups you use a day?
When you quench your thirst, the glass is no longer useful, and you throw it away.
To throw away?
Have you ever thought where are you going?
From the planet&#39;s point of view, there is no such thing as &quot;throwing away&quot;.
He will always be somewhere.
And where are you going?
It goes into the environment, polluting the soil, rivers and seas.
If you throw it on the ground, it is taken by the rains to rivers and seas, but if you throw it in the common garbage, which is organic garbage, it goes to sanitary landfills, which are places where garbage is decomposed.
Starting to do simple things: changing the plastic cup for a returnable bottle.
A few more tips to do on a daily basis: use your own returnable bottle, or biodegradable cups made from cassava starch, rice, sugar cane or paper; do not throw garbage on the floor and, when you throw it in the trash, throw it in the right trash.
To remind you sometimes, you can use the three Rs: &quot;reduce&quot;, &quot;reuse&quot; and &quot;recycle&quot;.
Reduce: consume without waste.
As I said, changing the plastic cup for the returnable bottle is already reducing.
Reuse: reuse or create new objects.
And recycle: throw the product in the correct trash so that it is recycled.
Now, think with me: is the garbage man the one who generates the garbage or the one who removes it?
Employees who collect city garbage are not garbage collectors.
They are responsible for cleaning the city.
When I use a disposable cup, it becomes mine.
So it is my responsibility to dispose of it in the correct trash.
Do your part and throw the trash in the right place.
And, at the end of it all, what really makes the difference between a healthy and strong world and a world all polluted?
We make the difference.
The attitude of each one of us can change the world.
Thanks.
(Applause)
