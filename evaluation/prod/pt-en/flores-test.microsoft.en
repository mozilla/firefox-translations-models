This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already well accepted, but also offers details that are not found as often in fossils, such as colors and the three-dimensional arrangement.
. Scientists claim that the upper plumage of this animal was brown and the lower part was light or carotenoid.
The discovery also grants clues about the evolution of feathers in birds.
The feathers of dinosaurs, known as rachis, do not have a well-developed stem, but they do have other characteristics, such as barbs and barbs. In view of this, the researchers concluded that the rachel was possibly the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to these other traits.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather to display or regulate temperature. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample has the plumage of an adult, not that of a cub.
The researchers suggested that although the tail is from a young dinosaur, the sample reveals an adult plumage, not a down.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than twenty others.

The work done was, for the most part, theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, causing the tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of halo and is composed of several tiny particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and deposit a pre-printed sheet indicating the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the officers verify the identity of the voter, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral law codifies procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can testify that no envelope is present at the beginning of voting and that no envelope is added, with the exception of those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe all parts of the process. During the night, votes are counted by volunteers under careful supervision, following specific procedures.

Four skiers from the women's group failed to finish their races, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify in the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered their mobile phone and laptop."
The accused were named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The accused appeared in court with his face covered, police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said.
Although three people were inside the house when she was hit by the car, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalised at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff's Court ever since, charged with the murder of her son.
She is in custody pending her arrest and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be compromised because her image has been widely circulated.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scotland's justice system acts differently, and courts regard the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to go in a dangerous direction when they post photos, videos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is in general charge of the cases, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made, at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other issues covered include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to leave that presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control test came under close supervision by foresters while the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership of NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, according to the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the NPWS' Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
Yesterday, Martelly promised a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelly's fifth ZIP code in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the prior resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country toward new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the general protests organized against the regime. The demonstrations began in October.
The occasionally violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some planned since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods with overheating problems have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 crashes related to the devices.
Last week, METI disclosed that Apple had informed it of 34 more incidents of overheating, which the company classified as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time. GMT time, it was on Friday at 9:19 p.m.
The Northern Mariana emergency management office said there was no reported damage in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held them hostage in Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were Filipino photographers.
Then the photographers later took the place of an old lady who had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and went on to pursue a career in medicine.
He educated himself as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Although she was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in her spare time.
His research demonstrated that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the baby's fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua said government investigators recovered two "black boxes," flight data recorders, on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first businesswoman. Luna passed away on a night with two moons. Something exceptional, just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin Goldust Runnels said, "Luna was as crazy as I was... or maybe even more... I loved her and will miss her... hopefully she'll be in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the percentage of those opposed to Australia's move to become a republic has grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 campaign for the national election that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 per cent of those who took part in the survey share this view, wishing Queen Elizabeth II would be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100 and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his grievances, his physical condition was called into question.
He was unable to take the necessary medications to overcome the pain, since these are forbidden in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of Jan. 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different types of hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source of water distribution to the earth along with organic matter that can develop proteins and make life possible.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his administration earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "politicking and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would let aircraft fly on shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon output.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater accuracy and offer more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no extra transport and surface trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking lots and public transport connections will not be available.
The problem of lack of transportation increased the possibility of the game having to be held behind closed doors, without the presence of the fan.
On Thursday, the journal Science published a study reporting the discovery of a new bird species in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was believed to take much longer, due to reproduction between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the cactus migrating finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in any kind of shape. It can even be rolled into small shapes.
It is possible to stretch to form a thin thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into leaves.
It can be very thin and glued to another metal. Because it was so thin, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called chemical PH. You can make a marker using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders and, with clean hands, mold them into the shape of a ball.
The moisture of the hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a type of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet seat in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remaining parts of sewage systems have been found in the homes of the Minoan towns of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public toilets, frequented by both men and women.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then redirects it back, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 30 meters high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel did for us was to give us a much easier and faster transportation.
He gave us the train, the car, and various other forms of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that eat smaller, much more numerous animals such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The revelation for their success is the concept of niche, a special function that each cat does that prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called packs.
The flocks consist of one to three adult males from the same family, along with up to 30 females and chicks.
Women are often closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion carpets act similarly to groups of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the roar of a lion's whole voice, but more like a phrase of shouted and growled words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find their prey by smell, sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and can also move stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by mixing with the environment around them and then attack their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they go to an island from which it is not possible to return easily), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one in which they lived before.
This new environment has different features and new competitors, so the new population will need to acquire different characteristics from the ones it already has and adapt to become a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale)
Plants use the sun as their food through photosynthesis. They also offer shade.
We build our houses using plants and we make our clothes using plants. Most of the foods we consume are plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The Mosasaur was the alpha predator of its era, so the only thing it feared were other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were studded with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set on the roof of his mouth, which shows that nothing that crossed his path could escape.
We're not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and may even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex would be no match for him.
Although most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans still had their share of strange or unusual foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snail, and a type of rodent called arganaz
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting in chairs, rich men enjoyed holding banquets together where they lay on their sides while they ate their meals.
Food in ancient Rome did not include supplies originating from America and Asia to Europe, as it did in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for each of their gods, who were considered the home of their respective gods.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests sought to meet the needs of these gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary into which only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramids shaped like towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard, the shops were just open counters facing the street. Stones were used in the construction of houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland had its colonization sparsely. In the Nordic sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west, he found Greenland and gave it its name.
But regardless of their discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie The Legend of the Lost Treasure, you might find that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text appears in the bottom corner of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence, the large parchment document (it measures 293/4 inches by 241/2 inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Thus, it is likely that a note was simply added as a label.
The landings and subsequent battles on D-Day liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the French "Vichy". They were French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and which also somehow defines the size of society.
The city-states are the forerunners of nations. The culture of civilization implies the transfer of knowledge through different generations, a lasting cultural reach and a just dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving adequate historical evidence and are no longer recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—Congress being its only component—according to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to demand taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, which generally did not cooperate, to enforce all their laws.
In addition, there was no authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were almost never present.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful in the world and was champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/island group that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical position, as an "archipelago"
The foundation of Taiwan dates back to the fifteenth century, when Europeans who sailed through the region baptized the place as Ilha Formosa.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company opened a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in Aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they were originally like.
In the year 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was recovered, and this recovery continues to this day.
As an example, the most common form of still image photography on the planet is 35 mm, which was the film size that had the most in circulation at the end of the analog film era.
Currently it is still produced, but the most important thing is that its proportion was inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm shape is actually confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The screen ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the lowest ratio between integers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are the same or very close to this ratio.
The rather abused and often demoralized law of third parties is a fairly simple guideline that provides a dynamic while maintaining relative order in a figure.
According to him, the intersection of the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example) is the most effective place for the main subject.
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united European states, despite differences in language and customs. I
Everyone was affected by his influencing strength, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central leadership of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, with the cutting off of vital supplies from military and civilians, although this blockade has violated international regulations generally accepted and laid out in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, bringing danger even to neutral flag ships.
Germany, since there was limited response to this tactic, expected an attack similar to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wished to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States penniless, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the head of his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of demonstrating different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Moreover, between each dynasty there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The best known of these periods was the time of the Three Kingdoms, which occurred for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war took place between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the throne of Xi'an's great palace.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Moreover, after the Revolution, vacancies were opened to all male candidates, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military, since instead of ranks being based on social class, they were now based on character.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working-class people from other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as 'Hira'" on the mountain of 'Noor' (light) for contemplation.
the cave itself, which has survived the times, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's religious inclinations.
Resting on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find it, even if it is known that it exists. Once inside the cave, it is a total isolation.
You can't see anything but the clear blue sky above and the surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Necropolis of Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and relatives.
The "arc pointing up" mark has its similar appearance with a V, and the "arch mark pointing down" has its similar appearance with a clamp or a square without the underside.
Cima means that you must start at the tip and push the bow; low means that you must start at the bead (which is where you hold the bow) and pull the bow.
In general, an upward arc produces a softer sound, while a downward arc produces a stronger, more assertive sound.
You can write your own notes, but don't forget that printed bow notes exist for a musical reason, so these should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Eleven Maria Theresa and four-year-old Louis Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of women from the markets.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a protester waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenditures of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino population itself.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to defray a large portion of the expenses and interest on floating-rate bonds on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the superprofits arising from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time when such events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history between the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a range of ideas in practice, from the supply of technology or the technological imperative to a strict notion that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and the manifestation of them in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share 2 general ideas: the first is that technological development itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence; the second is the idea that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that the automobile necessarily results in the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning an automobile.
Mass car ownership leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the health system to heal injured bodies.
Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Geography, in the context of Romanticism, caused citizens to be shaped and that, with the passage of time, the customs and culture linked to this geography emerged, which, because it was in harmony with the place of society, became better than the laws eventually obligatory.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that participants in the Crusade returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices, which were worth more than what Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital of Constantinople was transferred to Paris.
The Gothic language reached its apex moment in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and also in the 14th century.
In the beginning, the garments were greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the eastern region.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west can lag behind for 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began the development of its own style. One of the biggest advances for the time was that, as a result of the crusades, people began to use buttons to close their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of enough food to satisfy only the needs of farmers and their families.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, usually organic, system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers have been involved with subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in most developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or sex of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to resort to the few regrettable cases of children who were, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
These children are called "fierce" or savages. Some of these children were confined by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection of the child by the parents because of his or her severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children who are angry may have suffered serious trauma or abuse in childhood, before being abandoned or running away from home.
Others are supposed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived on their own in the jungle.
When completely raised by animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular pet, such as his fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an aid for students who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or face-to-face, in other words, a teacher can be considered a scaffold, just like that talking clip from Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software with the aim of questioning, alerting and explaining procedures that can be challenging for the student to deal with alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a multitude of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that doesn't nurture, care for, and educate, but it does.
We see the Foster Care System as a safe zone for these children.
Our adoption platform has a duty to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, regular education and guaranteed medical care.
Foster care is supposed to satisfy all the needs that were missing in the home from which they were taken.
The internet combines elements of both interpersonal and mass communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are indicated as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "relationships with continuity" were also identified as new characteristics of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to web pages.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that a person can detect whether another person is lying through the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has concluded that there are two ways of genetic variation: secret and manifest.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection removes it from the expressed variation grouping.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two bases with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans, consuming the available plant resources, to satisfy its amino acid requirements.
In addition, not acting accordingly has serious consequences: severe depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant-based resources would be proteins in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for us primates to digest unless they are cooked.
However, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide proteins in large quantities that contain all the essential amino acids.
Taking all this into account, it wouldn't be surprising if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" much like today's savanna chimpanzees do.
Sleep disruption is a process that consists of waking up purposely during the normal period of sleep and falling asleep soon after (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a half-quiet alarm clock to bring him to consciousness without waking him up for good.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other possibilities based on biorhythm include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, as it forces the person to get up to urinate.
A person's level of inner peace correlates in the opposite way to their level of bodily and spiritual tension.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that gets in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but they have been amplified by the path of Mahayana love and by many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, kundalini energy (illuminating energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central part of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common villain in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the US. With the end of the war, the clashes of system, processes and cultures led to the disintegration of countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
The goal was to last for the next 40 years, and in fact there would be leadership of replacement troops on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already destroyed and the only way out was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient means of moving people and goods on a large scale across the oceans.
The job of the navies has traditionally been to ensure that their country maintains the ability to displace population and goods while at the same time interfering with the ability of their enemies to move their own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic battle of World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy organization, using mainly U-boats, was trying to end this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have the ability to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to maintain them in order to facilitate access to milk, fur, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in flocks that walked in the hills or other pasture areas, often tended for by shepherds who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the better-known shepherd. These grazing methods are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England from the 16th century.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, this allowed the horses to pull them to reach higher speeds and carry larger loads on the slightly rougher roads.
Sleepers were implemented early on, to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal cover on top.
This became a common practice, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning "erect man").
Its predecessor, the Australopiteco, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedality adaptations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating to between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago. However, Sahelanthropus may have been standing, with both legs, much earlier, seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is exactly like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not want to have only a temporary solution, we must find the source of the problems and put an end to them.
It is obvious enough that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of the human race, and problems have become greater because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of man.
After adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten sketch, signed by Congressional President John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to a John Dunlap printing press.
During the night around 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap attacks".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap attacks that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handmade copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is alive to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have scaled paws and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs, like a T-rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are classified as binary digits - or bits, using the language used in computing.
Inner poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The biggest indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container with medication or toxic chemicals for household use.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions related to this particular poison.
The term "insects" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to treat this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are quite structured to stick to humans.
Both barbers and bedbugs are nidicollous, adapted to live in nests or shelters of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the main neurological disease in young people and adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their or their child's interest.
Such couples are allowed to decide to make a plan to adopt the baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents rescind their parental rights so that another couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. It is this method that guides scientific research.
It is not, in fact, just experimentation; An experiment is a test used to eliminate one of the possible hypotheses or more, to ask questions. Making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, the Latin Bible.
All of Aristotle's scientific thoughts were accepted, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek receded, the West found itself far removed from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Various rhythms observed in physiology and behavior usually depend fundamentally on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are absolutely not responses to external periodic stimuli, have been found for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate for a continuous cycle period, even without the interference of the environment.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main indicators that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase use phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments that tagged either the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting areas of nature with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including fauna and flora.
Examples of local activities include fishing, taking photographs, seeing birds, visiting the parks and studying about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, by car, people leave the small towns of the countryside, to go to work in other cities, and they come across other people who work precisely in these small towns from which they left.
In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is somehow connected and supporting a transport system based on private cars.
Science points out today that this carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from the stable state that had enabled human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone also complains about these transportation systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of complaints about water quality or falling bridges are rarely heard.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic Flow is the analysis of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two different points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Such relationships assist in the planning, design and operations of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to go into the air. Their ability to fly helped them flee more easily from enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot bend their wings backwards are dragonflies and ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed otherwise; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds sensible, because planet Earth doesn't look like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon is the longest and second longest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes almost 10 km wide.
A total of 20% of the water that goes from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi). It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancients of New Kingdom Egypt marveled at the constructions of their predecessors, which were by then much more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City has about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the common language used by most working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since antiquity, people have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper, because they can all be discovered in nature in natural form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements, which are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more related to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, even though he also theorized that they turn into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are simply a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You also get alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
All things in the universe are made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so hauntingly small that it would be possible for trillions of them to fit at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was released.
Unfortunately, as new methods of writing appeared, the pencil was relegated to a less important role and use.
These days, people write messages through computer screens and don't have to go near a pointer.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something newer emerges.
The fission pump works based on the principle that energy is needed to build a nucleus with several protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like riding a heavy cart up a hill. The division of the core again then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to separate with little or no incentive.
The surface of the Moon is composed of stones and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the invisible side.
The layer is thinner under the seas and thicker below the mountains.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they reach adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that makes them want what they do and what things in their environment will cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general terms, two behaviors can surface as managers begin to lead their former co-workers. One side of the spectrum tries to stay "part of the group of guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, doing performance appraisals, delegating and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team has done and make their own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of a team.
This behavior often ends in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have to maintain the same standards of excellence as teams considered conventional, however, there are some subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet in varying time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to whom each member must report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the difficult process of establishing organizational learning? One of the practical goals of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used by all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity shine through.
As a result, the process of an organization working as a team to overcome a difficulty can lead to an innovative new process that meets the customer's need.
Before an organization can even be innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies the Continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels in their performance.
Neurobiological data offer physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, they narrow the research area and make it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain and behavioral pathology underpins scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to design simulation models that help us understand the processes that exist in our mind.
Although AI has a strong sci-fi connotation, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, addressing behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves producing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent activity.
Examples include controlling, planning and scheduling, the ability to meet clients' questions and diagnoses, as well as handwriting, voice and speech recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military as it is integrated into various home computer and video game software applications.
Study visits are very important for any school class. Often, teachers would love to take their students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
The technology offers the solution with virtual field classes. From the classroom, students can see museum pieces, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a tour and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year, students at North Carolina's Bennet School develop a website about their trip to the state capital. Every year, the site is remodeled, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a book of remembrance.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Since students often initiate their contact with blogs using poor grammar and spelling, then the presence of an audience often changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve writing and avoid criticism.
In addition, having a blog "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to nurture public interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can make students more analytical and critical; By actively interacting with Internet content, students can position themselves in the context of others' writings, as well as define their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and features a number of art galleries and museums that demonstrate Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is further south; the north boasts the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and more.
Because of all this and more, Ontario stands out as what outsiders consider the essence of Canada.
Large areas further north are also quite sparsely populated and some are practically uninhabited in nature.
For comparison of the population that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the U.S. than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean, a distance from the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in its own right, when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxurious beach hotels.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, which gained much popularity in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the fifteenth century, when explorer Portuguese Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all travelers say they are married, regardless of current marital status.
It's also useful to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to acts that they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in refusing men. Don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether it's for cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenidas as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name of the White House, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco as a whole.
Near the historical part of Medina it is easy to find traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a bunch more trinkets, all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east, near Rwanda.
In the year 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried a large part of the city's streets, mainly the center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be studied to understand the state of the battle that persists in the province of Nord-Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest gorilla mountain trails in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (mototaxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a quick ride.
"Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor to refer to distant and exotic lands, in view of their relative inaccessibility.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city despite its reputation making it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In the year 1990, it was placed on the list of world heritage sites in threat, due to the danger of the desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World program, broadcast on PBS.
The city contrasts sharply with the rest of the country because it has a more Arab than African touch.
Kruger National Park is in northeastern South Africa, along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River on the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different animal species.
It is one of South Africa's top attractions and is considered the banner of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
There are fees for entrance and conservation of the park, as with all of South Africa's national parks.
It can also be very useful to acquire a Wild Card. With it you can have access to several parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider as its main attraction.
The parade of buildings that form Hong Kong's skyline has already been compared to a shimmering bar chart that is visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the edge of Kowloon on the opposite side.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place that British settlers chose to live, and so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a great place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest mangrove strip in the world, stretching for 80 km (50 mi) inland from Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park
But forests don't just rely on mangrove swamps — they have some of the last great jungles that have ever covered the remaining gangetic surface.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², a third of which is covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer sighted in the area.
There are several bus departure times from the interdistrict bus station (across the river) during the day, but most, especially those going east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
As interdistrict buses are almost always crowded, it is advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese coastal minibuses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge of the Oiapoque River is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and São Jorge do Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and two lanes 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011 and did not open for transit until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to enter into operation in September 2017, the date scheduled for completion of customs inspections in Brazil.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group that inhabited what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicurus and Paiaguás, who lived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the sixteenth century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", arose from the encounter of the Spanish conquistadors with the native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the creation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has succeeded in the permanence of many of its characteristics and identity of the indigenous populations.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
To find out about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands that is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is generally accepted anywhere on the islands and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currencies may be received. Please inquire with the owners in advance to know which payment method they accept.
It's virtually impossible to change the Falklands currency outside the islands, so swap the money before leaving the islands.
As Montevideo is south of the equator, there is summer, while it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be disappointingly cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make the feeling cooler than what the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains basically the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the presence of humans, they are still wild animals that should not be fed or bothered.
Following the instructions of the park authorities, keep at least 100 yards/feet from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/feet from all other wildlife!
Despite their docile appearance, bison, elk and bears, as well as all large animals, can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so don't get close.
What's more, know that odors attract bears and other wildlife, however, avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food and keep camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town lies on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a well-known naval stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the U.S. and Britain refused to leave it.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of one British cruiser. Nearly 200 lives of Germans and Americans perished.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city resulted in the assassination of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland being between two coves. The most popular are in three areas.
The beaches of the north coast (in the North Harbour district) are bathed by the Pacific Ocean and range from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many have shades coming from the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in Waitemata Harbour in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide variety of shops around the coast. Swimming is pretty safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One'. It's not an elaborate beer, but it's pleasurable and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are plenty of French wines to appreciate, but New Zealand and Australian wines can go down better.
Local tap water is totally safe to consume, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're afraid.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is strange. A short black coffee is "espresso", the cappuccino comes full of cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is in line with Belgian standards. Natural juices are expensive, but great.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes, which occur on the reef, are rare.
Keep heeding the reminders of the authorities, obeying all the signs and paying close attention to safety alerts.
The cubomedusa occurs near beaches and river estuaries, from October to April, north of 1770. They may occasionally be found in other periods.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most are afraid of humans and tend to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean. Its main habitat is the estuaries of the rivers that lie north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often do business with specific hotels, although it is likely to be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even packages combined with flights and hotels.
They can also secure your booking if you need time to think about the offer or gather other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have any changes or requests, this should first be forwarded to the travel agent, and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp there, and most of them consider this a key part of the experience.
If you want to stay close to the action, you'll have to get there early to be able to camp near the music.
Remember that even after the music closes on the main stages, some sections of the festival can continue playing until late.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, because when crossing the ice is generated a terrible noise for the most sensitive.
St. Petersburg cruises include city tours. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by their visitors. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offers to keep guests in a good mood and to keep them on site.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages on account of the house. However, drunkenness undermines judgment, and all good bettors know the importance of maintaining sobriety.
Whenever someone is driving in places with high latitudes or on roads over the mountains, they should take into account the possibility of facing snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, friction is low, and you can't drive like you're on clean asphalt.
During blizzards, it is possible to fall enough snow to leave you trapped in a very short time.
Visibility may also be lower due to falling or windy snow, or by condensation or ice in the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic remains almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the apple of many visitors' eyes.
The term "safari," in its colloquial usage, refers to overland trips to observe impressive African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars and the basic equipment allows good visualization.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
Also known as a "walk in the woods," "hiking safari," or "pass," a walking safari is equivalent to walking, whether for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympics will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will be hosted in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but at the end of March most cancellation policies because of the coronavirus did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets to the events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with normal tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help dry. Many hotels have iron and ironing board for loan, even if there is not one in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you do not like to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if it is available.
Be careful not to let the tissue heat up too much (which can cause it to shrink or, in more severe cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough; in others, many minutes are required.
The quality of the filters vary, and if you're in doubt, you might want to consider buying gallons of water from a trusted company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests with which they are unfamiliar in the regions from which they came.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or at worst, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people through force, generally do not qualify as pests.
Duty free shopping is the chance to buy goods free of taxes and fees in certain locations.
Travelers visiting high-tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging conditions for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, who often pass through isolated backcountry areas.
If you don't have the habit of driving on country roads, be judgmental: steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp curves are common.
The advertised speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections – commonly 55-65 km/h – and strict obedience to them is even more important than the other way around.
Interestingly, however, cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are very good, and in Bavaria they are very neat and varied, similar to those in the southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit candies are recurring, with apples baked in sweets year-round, and cherries and plums making their presence felt during the summer.
Many goods from German bakeries also have almonds, hazelnuts and other chestnuts. The famous cakes usually combine very well with a very strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but tasty sweets, try what, depending on the region, can be called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.

With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a range that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But if used without other qualifiers, the term tends to mean that the food is originally from the central and eastern parts of the main Java island.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a variety of dishes seasoned in a simple way, the predominant condiments preferably Javanese being peanuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
In order for a rider's feet to have support, stirrups are used, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but may present safety issues as the rider's feet may become trapped in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but has had one of his feet clinging to the stirrup, he can be dragged if the animal ends up running away. To lessen this danger, various safety precautions can be taken
First, a large part of the pilots wear riding boots with heels and smooth sole, which is quite narrow.
Then some saddles, mostly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Being Chile's top climbing destination, the Cochamó Valley is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite cliffs and cliffs.
Meetings include exciting viewpoints from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are continually establishing new routes among their endless potential of seawalls.
Snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding through snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is an important activity on the trip for many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski bums," who plan an entire vacation just to ski at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old—cave paintings depicting skiers, date back to 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century at the very least, and in the year 1861 the first recreational skiing team was opened by citizens of Norway in Australia.
Ski backpacking: activity also known as backcountry skiing, hiking or ski-mountaineering.
It is related, but usually does not involve tourism for alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter done in steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a hiking route.
In good condition, you'll be able to cover slightly longer distances than on foot — but only very rarely will you get the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
The Schengen zone, however, functions as a country in this respect.
If you stay in this area, it is possible to cross the border without going through passport checkpoints again.
Similarly, by holding a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for visas for each of the member countries of the Schengen area separately, thus saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that specifies which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items that are more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer farming is an important livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture around trade is important for many other classes of professionals as well.
As much as it is a tradition, not all Sami participated in the breeding of reindeer on a large scale, but they lived from fishing, hunting and the like, with reindeer as mainly draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work with modern businesses. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.

When planning a visit to a country that is considered a war zone, the person must first receive professional training.
An Internet search for 'Hostile Environment Course' will usually indicate the address of a company in the region.
A course will typically cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with hands-on experience.
A course usually lasts between 2 and 5 days and involves dramatization, various first aids, and sometimes training with the use of weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with jungle survival are common, but publications about war zones are rare.
Travelers planning a sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they are carrying valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with undefined gender (X), or updated documents to find a desired name and gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is widely variable.
Searches of security checkpoints also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet had gender reassignment surgery should not expect to go through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the ebb of water from waves on the beach back into the sea, usually on a reef or similar area.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a rapid current can form to deep water there.
Most deaths are the result of fatigue from trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you can get out of the current, swimming back is no harder than it usually would be.
Try to aim from somewhere where you can't get caught or, depending on your abilities or if you've been detected, wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock occurs earlier than culture shock (there is less honeymoon time), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to the new culture sometimes have a special difficulty in readjusting to their native culture.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of your local culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People don't realize that patience and understanding are also key for travelers returning home.
In the area reserved for children, one of the most interesting things is the light show and sounds of the pyramid.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and also in the silence before the show begins.
Usually you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The history of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is defined as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed in the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which had their discovery in the year 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the largest amount of bases, with sixteen active until the year 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the village of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
The others are Livingston Island and Deception, in which the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here merge into the plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360-kilometer chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, cut by Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, reaching 4,892m on Mount Vinson.
In remote locations without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone usually does not replace a cell phone, since to make a call you need to be outdoors overlooking the satellite.
The service is often used for transportation, including recreational vessels, as well as expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local phone carrier may offer more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those who intend to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among those leaving school, allowing them to take a year before university without compromising their education.
In most cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can, in fact, increase your chances of entering higher education in your home country.
Typically, there will be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
For those who like boat trips, Finland is a great destination. In lakes and coastal archipelagos, the "Land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands.
In the archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.

Sailing with a dinghy is a national pastime in Finland, with one dinghy for every seven or eight people.
This is combined by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but a rather characteristic form (for example, in the Netherlands, the number is from one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for two full days and return to the ship to sleep at night.
If you embark only on sea excursions, you will not need a separate visa (valid from 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany, on flyers. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if those people haven't traveled by plane before or if they've never been through a traumatic event.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and dislike for other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear that is based on the unknown or not being in control.
Carriers are well paid to deliver things quickly. Time is often of the essence in sending commercial documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they shipped things by air freight, depending on the route, it can take days to reach the landing and go through customs.
The only way to get through faster was to send as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is by shelling out a large amount of money for the privilege (or, better yet, getting your company to do it for you).
However, it's not cheap: as basic rules, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times more for first class!
In general terms, it's not even worth looking for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a small group of passengers who are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The language of the country is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic relations were re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third largest city, with approximately 3.7 million people, and has the second largest port after Istanbul, as well as an excellent transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of İzmir, it is now a modern, developed and bustling commercial center, located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are marked by traditional red roofs, the 18th-century market, and the old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere reminiscent more of Mediterranean Europe than of classical Turkey.

Please treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the place by staining or cracking the buildings with graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half of people prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost all know Spanish.
However, most of the plates are only in Catalan, because this is the language that has been established by law as an official language.
Still, Spanish is widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned outages are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inappropriate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is still good behavior, to act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-educated). This will make the trip considerably easier.
The brusque exterior of Parisians will quickly disappear, if you show some basic courtesies
Plitvice Lakes National Park is highly wooded, mostly with beech, fir, and pine trees, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
There is a remarkable diversity of plant communities, due to the varied microclimates, different soils and different levels of altitude.

Rare animals can be and found there, such as European grizzly bears, wolves, eagles, owls, bobcats, feral cats and tetrazes, as well as several other common species
While visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts covering their knees and also need to have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide costumes for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own costumes, especially with bright colors, you will be greeted with a smile from the monk or nun.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants covering their knees.
It is possible to borrow clothes at the entrance; however, they are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For men, there is a one-size-fits-all!
Majorcan cuisine, as well as that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in everything.

Premodern observatories are most often outdated today and remain in museums or schools.
Because light pollution in their golden age wasn't a problem, they often find themselves in cities or university campuses, easier to get to than those built more recently.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas that have favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look best when they're in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" seedling.
If you are going to visit a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will also cause you to be expelled, with no right to discussion.
Singapore is usually an extremely safe and very easy place to explore, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.

There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches usually hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend. Congregations often break the celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you're visiting the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you'll experience polar night, which means the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky gets dark more or less at the right time.
As the areas are sparsely inhabited, and consequently light pollution is not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
In Japan, labor cultural relations are more based on hierarchy and formality than Westerners are used to seeing.
Suits are the standard attire in business, and co-workers call each other by their last names or job titles.
