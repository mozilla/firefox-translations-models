What's going to happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor any pastry shop in Prague.
The newly elected CSSD mayor of the capital will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand each other at the level of the municipal council with their old and new colleagues of the ODS.
The daily Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the city council belonging to CSSD, to know if they know the argôt that was born in recent years in the town hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition who ruled in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that Prague's political cream set in motion during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It was with surprise that it was discovered that the newly elected do not understand the known terms very well.
Or so they say.
"Who is Valdemort".
"I really don't know."
"I am a youngster in Prague politics," said Lukas Kaucky, the elected representative of culture to the test of the vocabulary of the "godfather".
And as for the veteran politician, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example the meaning of "golf hole".
"This is the only expression among those you propose to me that I use"
Otherwise, I do not use argôt.
From the vocabulary, whose expressions were published by the Aktualne.cz daily in June this year before the ODS pre-ectoral congress, the editorial team chose 6 examples, primarily those linked to Prague City Hall.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", go to the pastry", "bull's nerve", "betrayal of the capital" and "coat".
Three of the elected representatives agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who is to lead education in Prague in the future - first promised an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek flatly refused the test.
"I do not deal at all with these things and how the representatives of citizen democracy have fun: I will not give my opinion."
"I am currently dealing with how we are going to understand each other in our programmes," he said.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would not apparently recognize in the legend above, that it is the influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," Kaucky says and immediately adds, "But I know it from the newspapers."
"I'll have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the elected for the environment, know that the golf hole is the Blanko tunnel.
The two Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks of the meaning of "going to the pastry".
"It's about, I think, going to a company", Plachy is ready to guess that this is the headquarters of the Janousek companies.
In the same tone, Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather from newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to test takers, there is no lexicon of argôt in social democracy.
"I've taken advice with colleagues and it turns out we really don't have something like this."
"We say names to each other sometimes we use abbreviations and symbols," says Peter Hlinsky, chairman of the Social Democratic Party, which party members call Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Brezina said of the nicknames.
The daily Actuel.cz tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Grandpa for the members of the Party or the less friendly Little old man, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by scams during the sponsorship of the party, is nicknamed "the little toy".
The nicknames are also the only ones that the Social Democrats admit to using within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda very much, but the daily Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor of baton law" it is said that Petr Hulinsky obtained his doctorate in law JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "witches", a pamphlet has been published.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
They tend to belong to the older generation, cannot work for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes a "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man very rarely has this destiny."
"Young women are also not judged to be healthy because they participate in labour and give birth to children," says a sister who cares in the West African capital, Burkina Faso, in a special facility of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He has published a pamphlet that should help limit witch hunting.
The case has a "catch".
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the daily Die Standard warned about the disadvantage of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Burkina Faso's neighbour Ghana, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman, died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil they had sprayed on her.
It was the BBC server that transmitted this information.
The criminals claim it was the evil eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual anointing ignited on contact with the woman.
The oil blazed, it seems, when the team wanted to "chase away the evil spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Human spirit eaters have always been a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso is working to curb the witch hunt, Gambia as recently as last year even saw the President himself participate.
"Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a broad witch hunt who, it seems, participated in his death and tried with black magic to kill the President as well."
"Shamans from nearby Guinea came to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police and the personal guard of the President, men and women chosen at random from villages in The Gambia," Amnesty International said in a message.
On the farm the imprisoned people had to drink a plant-based potion with hallucinogenic effects that also caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
Under international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
Bakal's tenant: The stoves are heating up, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing elderly man walked out the door of the customer center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his own, that of his daughter and his son who is serving a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 apartment of second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and the heating runs on solid fuel," points to the man who has the signing power on his son's new contract.
"But I signed anyway," he explains angrily and half-resigned.
The citizens' association of BytyOKD.cz apartments, which has described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to follow to claim.
But the man reacts to this with a wave of the hand.
"One says that, the other says something else," frowning.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what awaits most apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne.cz decided to personally visit the "laboratory".
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesdays at 9 a.m.
Right next to the door stands a guard from a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, "rent 2011", is lit on the touch screen.
A single press and a paper with a number comes out of the device.
You do not have time to read your number "157" that your number already begins to light up on the big screen under the topit of the waiting room.
In a split second it's your turn.
After a short while, an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rents don't seem to concern the people in the waiting room.
The majority of people came to solve common problems like everywhere - requests for repairs, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have been receiving letters with new lease agreements in their mailboxes since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
The special window for new rents has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It's been working for almost a week, so it's still on trial," replies, after a moment's hesitation, the employee behind the counter when the customer introduces himself as a journalist.
Deragulation and the former miners' apartments in Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
Lubomir Zaoralek, deputy speaker of parliament from the Ostrava region, of the Social Democrats, reported on this quite extensively before the elections and it now fills the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change me a put... n of board in the toilet, relieves himself in introduction the man mentioned.
However, it is mostly, according to employees, retirees who come to be sure that they will receive a discount on the new rent price if they sign now as RPG promised in a special offer.
It is a rebate of half the amount of rent that will receive the other loctaries who have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" counter on Havirovaska Street is really not burdened by questions.
"Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent," says the employee at the counter.
And yet RPG offers both on its website and in the windows individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If the two parties do not agree on the rent, an independent tribunal will make the decision.
"These are not threats but only to inform about the unique and legitimate way to act legally," RPG says on its website.
"No one will go to court here," thinks one of RPG Byty's employees and the man in the street in front of the customer center agrees with her.
"I have 13,000 crowns of pension and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he said.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore people wait," she said.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," says Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that it is precisely the negligence of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the rent increase.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with rents to invest in apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 it should make 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling in front of the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room on Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
"The rent increase in 2011 is 15 percent and concerns no less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be no more than 7.50 Czech crowns per m² per month," the screen says.
The 38 percent increase is for only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, it is an increase of a really very low sum of 19.66 Czech crowns per m²," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical increase but a gradual increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the rent increase (see graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the rent increase agreement have priority.
The nursery school is also part of the offices understood by the architects.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also house a mini kindergarten with everything you need - colored walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of Arch. design employees have been able to go there.
The architectonic project company Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini company nursery school since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
She employs about 90 people, mostly of childbearing age, and it was important to her that women architects and project managers could quickly return to work.
Along with short-time employment contracts, kindergarten is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. as part of its social programme.
Builders and architects have the opportunity to combine work taking care of children.
These are the employees of Arch. Design.themselves who imagined this nursery school and with the support of the management they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-kindergarten is financed from the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme for Human Resources and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to funding grants (up to 2.8 mil.de Czech crowns). They were able to buy equipment and appliances and after two years ensure qualified personnel as well as start-up.
After the use of the funding endowment (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini nursery school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project took a year and Economy rating helped to apply for the endowment.
The care of the children is provided by qualified staff, all day a nurse and a kindergarten teacher take care of the children. Children can go to nursery school without age limit, but they are over three years old for the most part.
As it is a "mini kindergarten" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who replace each other.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school regardless of hierarchical position.
Although it is an individual care and education, the curriculum of the mini-kindergarten is comparable to that for preschool education.
The children not only play but also quality education is provided - from the beginning to the preparation for school benches English is taught.
The classroom is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and not have the stress of being late in picking up children from a school far from the parents' workplace.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty is created between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.has thus registered among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and that are friendly towards the family and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look into Gaudi's interiors.
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase looks like a dinosaur spine and the balconies look like open fish mouths.
This is how the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi is.
Due to its organic forms, the house received from the locals the nickname of Bone House.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, façade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present curves, this is all that is ypic for Antoni Gaudi's Art Nouveau.
The front façade of the house unfolds its dream lines, pleasant colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation we see the geometry, the rhythm and the order thought with precision.
At night the façade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brilliance of the colors is reinforced.
The winding and twisting of shapes also appears in interiors with the same measure.
The wood copies in waves the window frames, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyepiece and the slats.
The Battlo house that stands in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia at the number. 43, was born from the construction of a house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction was done for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, initially insisted on demolishing the old building and building a brand new one but soon accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-unit house was not thought of by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that the decorations for a representative apartment of the owner of the building and the use of mosaic for the facade were born.
For the façade also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work for the plans of the Casa Battlo house began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi's Casa Mila house and Guell Park in which there are other works by Gaudi.
The locals nicknamed the hot house right after it was finished because of its organic forms "the Bone House".
Others, in view of the specific mechanism of opening the windows, have called it "the house that yawns".
It is said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of Saint George the patron saint of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the construction contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi has designed for the house a unique system in its time of central heating, with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree tilt seems odd.
During the creation Gaudi absolutely did not respect the building guidelines of the time and did not let himself be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the building permit, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the finishing the city council was horrified and asked for modifications.
It did not please, for example, the members of the municipal council that the pillars of the construction encroached on the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked (and obtained satisfaction) the authorization to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which one accesses up to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled out by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of linking spaces.
The common area can be connected completely by opening the doors of the lounges and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit the private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi received besides new facades a non-traditional roof and two floors more.
Gaudi's play with light is also impressive, blue and white glazed tiles with which the inner courtyard is decorated and with skylights.
The two-color play gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was enough to bet on the principle that white reflects more than dark which on the contrary absorbs the sun's rays.
The Casa Battlo house, which was inscribed in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund, can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous designer.
They continued the visits because they found that it is a lucrative business and they expanded the scope of visits to the common areas and the attic including roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; Students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders get 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entrance fee to Gaudi's other constructions in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you need to quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and completely visit the house.
How to choose a mattress and box spring: women have different criteria than men.
No ostentatious setting, but rather the quality of the bedtime area, so the mattress and box spring give a real base for a good bed.
They must of course complement each other harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are decisive: weight, height, age, state of health as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and box spring will be placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where one does not sleep continuously latex mattresses are not suitable because they "warm up" gently.
They also weigh more than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to turn them frequently.
If they do not also have enough ventilation channels in the core and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mold can also form there.
Habit is also decisive in the choice.
Those who spend most of the time abroad where very thick mattresses with a softening layer are frequently used, will hardly feel good on a low and hard surface.
"That's how all the hokeyists who come back from the NHL complain that they can't sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that therefore poorly assume 'information' from joints and skin," says Sylva Adamczikova who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered hokeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything is going well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have for example suitable mattresses.
You don't have to be an NHL guy to enjoy a lazy foam.
This "miracle" simply works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won't turn around in the night like after a tough game.
You just sleep better.
Lazy foam also works as a protection against esquarres.
For the choice of mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm, i.e. a total of 180 cm.
For single-seater beds, singles for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
This is convenient in case of visit.
'However there is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when lying on your back you should put your hands comfortably with your elbows slightly bent. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Saddlers-Mattressers and Decorators who has been dedicated for several years to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and teaches it in specialized schools.
For a double bed everyone needs their own box spring and mattress, so be careful however during the achât to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only have to mount the box spring at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, from this count for the shape and ventilation layer at least three centimeters.
"When touching or sitting on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a specific type of box spring.
The box spring bed, when the mattress and the box spring are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses ventilate very poorly; It should not be washed, which is common today.
And since during the night we normally sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large (and clogged) sieve.
For this, specialists refuse to advertise a 25-year lifetime for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But everything to its but.
And for this an advice of experience from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, forgo, for the coating of the mattress, hygiene or washing but rather add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to make coatings with zipper for the whole set, that is to say that after opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise the manipulation for large models (and for only one person) becomes when they are removed a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight in a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a box spring?
Never!
Maximum for a bed intended for visitors for a single night.
However equip the board (if there are none) with ventilation holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with pouch springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and a layer of ventilation.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type.
For single-position slat bases with 14/18 slats, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more slats, 28 and above, where the lamellae are lined in the lower part of the kidneys and it is thus possible to regulate their rigidity.
For multi-position mattresses do not take a spring mattress because it does not respond to changes in position.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the lamellae, you can also install what is called a shoulder cradle.
It is a special connection of the lamellae that allows to put pressure or even tilt the lamella so that the shoulder of the sleeper "integrates" well.
For men who have "shoulders as wide as their backs", this is really an important thing.
This thing is already considered by mattress manufacturers who for "men" have begun to use a softening area at the shoulders.
But they also think about women - they again offer them a softer surface at the hips.
For the most difficult customer there are wing or platelet bed bases with what is called a multi-force suspension.
The pressure spreads to more points and diinuates the tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated with air) on good mattresses and box spring, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow should support the head, and its tips should reach only the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians for example prefer.
When lying on your side, the pillow should level (with the shoulder cradle of the box spring or the softened area in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first ones based on straw and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also towards organic mattresses.
The petrole-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is made, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soy.
"The term organic for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products," says Petr vasicek of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coverings; One of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop forest or lavender scents.
There are differences between men and women.
While birch plant extract so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, coatings "heat" women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weaker sex.
The current favorites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cell structure so more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different stiffness of cold foams results in polyzone mattresses that know precisely where the head, lower back and feet are.
You will pay for a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those that are characterized by their parameters for health have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached first place.
Saving for the mattress and box spring is not easy.
From time to time, it is possible to have two mattresses for the price of one as part of special actions on the part of manufacturers or producers.
For example, the company Magniflex offers Duofreeze mattresses with Memory memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
We can obviously take the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and great thickness was started with Tempur material at a "cosmic" pace.
It started as material for NASA because astronauts were experiencing huge load factors at the start.
The Tempur softens in the heat and hardens, on the contrary, in the cold.
It therefore adapts perfectly to the hot human body and distributes optimal pressure.
It is therefore ideal against poor sleep and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot cushions that relieve the legs and venous system.
Czech manufacturers use, for example, EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly in demand by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child leads more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars, can just as easily be used to trace the movement of people and help in certain cases such as that of little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a matchbox but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka moved many people and they began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not espionage but just another way to reduce the likelihood that there will be another tragedy," says Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices to the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
"The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons," adds Pilin.
According to him, children should always know for what purpose "the box" is used and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bockova draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to carry something like this, he will get rid of it.
"And even the little ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something on purpose when they don't want to be under control."
"Mobile phones, which can cut off like these tracing devices, have already brought parents to long waits," Bockova says.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in case of aggression is very questionable.
"If it is a prepared abduction, the perpetrator will do everything to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him."
"Right now, it's the phone."
"As soon as the tracking devices develop, they (criminals) will look for them too because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases criminals will always be ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
She admits that such devices can help during an unprepared assault by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracing services for both cars and people, says that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an assault.
"The apparatus may be set in such a way that it is in regular emission after a specified period."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, there is still the last position of the person concerned."
"More expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who has slipped and finds themselves lying down without moving," says Cech.
According to him, so-called smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after formatting it with a special software.
The problem with current tracing systems is that they are either a device similar to those worn as a pendant the size of a matchbox or to the smallest telephone devices.
They can always be lost.
According to Pilina of the company Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being conducted to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential attacker will not be able to recognize the tracing device."
"Or he will find out after a while, which will have given the police a little more time," he adds.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to trace cars.
It is a combination of GPS location acquisition systems (which is commonly used in autonavigation) and a mobile phone feature that alerts a vehicle's current position.
The army has so many explosive cords that it could go around the Czech Republic with it. But it can only last two years.
The army has purchased 445 km of ropes used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defense had bought 224 km.
So the army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the cords is two to four years maximum.
The army bought explosive cords from the limited company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave as the reason for the achât of a huge quantity of detonating cords to MF DNES that the soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the calculations of reserve to be held made by the pyrotechnicians of the army, which MF DNES contacted, it appears that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household staff should have an annual exercise with explosives.
Alexander Vondra, Minister of Defence, and Vlastimil Picek, Army Commander, are no exception.
Only to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating cords.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army's reserves could support it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is enough at most 2 m of detonating cords, as the experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - with also the consumption of special units and engineers - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the soldiers of the Rapid Intervention Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that shooting sessions are limited because of the need for money.
About the lack of underwear we do not talk about it.
"And I don't mind if they buy such a large amount of detonating cords from us."
"And it's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"For us the army is a good customer that we strive as traders to please," says STV Group Commercial Director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of km of explosive cords have been destroyed by the fact that the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, reports only four years of detonating cord life and police and army pyrotechnicians only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it can even be up to four years," says one of them, who does not want his name published in view of the army's criticism.
Once the lifespan has passed, each munition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
These tests, however, are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the ministry is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating cortwo.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," said spokesman Pejsek, who is speaking for the defence ministry's buyers.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating cords of the police pyrotechnicians who neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police still order only the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of its lifespan.
This was established for reasons of safety for pyrotechnicians and in addition to be able to obtain more modern and reliable types of detonating cords more flexibly.
the Ministry of Defence today has great problems for the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, heading for the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old explosive cords that it buys today "cheaply".
Until today I benefit from contacts I have obtained through competitions.
The sale under franchise of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun for the place of winner of the contest for the best Individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of the Best Individual Entrepreneur competition for the past year was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure towards success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that Libérec lacked a quality hosting site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a third-year graduate student, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between the quality and price of accommodation in our region made me want to do something," says Lucas Pytloun.
He began renting the first rebuilt apartment to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profits in the building, which he transformed into a boarding house with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial action has allowed him to open in Libérec 4 pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of these was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year he received another one of identical quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the franchise of Pytloun Hotels have come forward," last year's No. 1 entrepreneur said.
"And for the sale of the license to operate a hotel on a large scale, winning the Entrepreneur of the Year competition served well," adds Pytloun gratefully.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Libérec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very pleasant," he recalls.
He recommends participation in this competition to anyone who is trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he is still using his contacts and knowledge that he could not have obtained in any other way.
"With those I met through the competition I started to maintain business relations regularly.
According to him, the fame linked to success has also had an impact on employees.
And he's about 70.
"I see in them above all the loyalty and pride of having committed themselves to something that has generally been recognized."
"This is not, by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of good work by all of us together.
"Only my name is being pushed forward," Lucas Pytloun says modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory has been replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the winner's sense of purpose Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to Slovansky dum for first place in the contest for Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tool shop in Ceska Skalice into a firm with a turnover of 100 million crowns.
"I can say that the award not only encouraged me also my employees and increased our self-confidence to fight against the competition," says the winner of last year's competition today.
At the beginning of the history of the Farmet company there was the desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the communists, he did not hesitate for long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with some comrades in his father's entourage for the manufacture of plastic bathtubs.
Not long after they started to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After eighteen years, it became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers really get to know the Farmet brand better, but also foreign partners who began to realize that they were collaborating with a company that was most successful in its home country," says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year was not spent in Farmet only there in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was based on the economic results of 2008 and partly of 2009.
And precisely in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their achâts of new equipment and technologies.
"We have obviously not escaped this situation."
"Turnover fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even lay off workers," says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation properly and maintained profitable results even if they were inferior to those they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued uncompromisingly to invest in research and development.
"With the endowments, we built a training and research center, strengthened the presentation of the company in international fairs and won the main awards in national exhibitions," Zdarsky says.
Everything leads us to believe that the crisis is behind them.
The figures of affires go up and with them the number of employees as well.
"To the new winner I wish that pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes senseless regulations.
The Absurdity of the Year investigation is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations have been removed.
This year's inglorious winner of this year's Absurdity of the Year survey was the requirement to bring documents into offices that officials can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the social affairs administration requested a paper extract from the commercial register, whereas the official can obtain it with two mouse clicks.
It changes thanks to the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the extract from the commercial register for insurance payment checks," said Jana Buranova, spokeswoman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
Highlighting all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs have to complete in the Czech Republic and having those that are absurd removed is the meaning of this Absurdity of the Year competition.
This survey is again this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3000 voters showed up, it is at least 4000 this year who brought their vote.
And it is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only hinder the company, and this, more and more.
"We may be at the top of the list of documents for tax returns in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the rest of the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is in 74th place in terms of conditions for the company, 8 places more than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was first established in 2006 and continues every year according to the same script.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic absurdities every year from April to the end of September, the last deadline before the competition closes.
To account there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organizer of the contest chooses seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita website and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that received the highest number of votes was declared the winner.
Until the last survey last year, a hundred, or more precisely, 105 regulations and decrees have lost their meaning.
Comments are sent by entrepreneurs but also professional unions and professors.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore among the nominees is for example the obligation that highway and expressway maintenance vehicles pay tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees, repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The proclamation of the competition, which always begins at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening in which personalities from political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the highlight of the competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts sucks in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this my goal is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the enterprise," said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to suppress absurd decrees is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what people did not like was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days before at the office for the sole proprietorship at the place where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the amendment of the Sole Proprietorship Act.
The second most popular requirement in 2007, which was to declare to the Labour Office a 30-day service trip for a foreign employee, was removed with the so-called Green Card Act.
And everything is ok until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of the Year 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year – the requirement to have a refrigerator has been removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Ecological, humanitarian, training and sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has already existed for 5 years, is the category called Responsible Firm of the Year 2010.
The objective of this contest is support for reasonable and fair enterprise.
"We want to support companies that monitor their company's environmental impacts and conduct socially responsible business," says Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone, which is the guarantor and promoter of this contest, as in the case of the contest for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this sub-category of the contest of the firm of the year 2010, organized by the firm Vodaphone, registered the companies that do not have success with a single long-term goal for the company.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspirations and an independent article would be to edit.
Although the purpose of their business is different from each other, their support and forecasting activity can be considered the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, it concerns people with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole of the Czech Republic is the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund that sponsors children with disabilities for 17 years.
In addition to dealing with employees with health problems, we can also mention the old paper mill in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 per cent of them, and for this reason was awarded the title of Responsible Firm for the Central Bohemian Region and placed third in the region in the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition.
In Olomouc, it was MiRyz Soft, a financial company, that won for introducing flexible working hours and even reducing average to 35 hours a week without, proportionately, a reduction in salary.
The jury also awarded her the title because she buys primarily from Czech manufacturers, supports a loyal activity in the immediate circle and is concerned about the environment.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business activity and administration have the least impact on the environment," says Miluse Ryznarova, the company's executive director.
the IT company Enlogit in the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up an ergonomic chair and keyboard for each laptop, encourages them to work from home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the Man in the Shadows Foundation, which helps the local Roma community," says Ondrej Suchy, the company's representative.
Also in the last place for its activities is a washing and cleaning company from the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the pension insurance of its employees in the form of above-standard bonuses.
"In our society we contribute to food, transportation, skill upgrading and recreation," says Joseph Strapac of the Bruntal construction company Czasch, winner for the Moravian-Silesian region.
All regional finalists for Vodaphone's Firm of the Year contest were automatically entered in the Responsible Company category, who had answered the questionnaires attached to the registration document and returned it to the organizer before August 15.
Incorrectly completed or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were removed from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing firms had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Firm's contest but were not disqualified from the Vodaphone Firm of the Year 'main' contest."
"Independent entries are not possible because it is a sub-category of the main competition of the Firm of the Year," says Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison&Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police made arrests during a public competition
In the Land Fund building in Plzen, anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed the local entrepreneur and real estate trader Lubos. G.
The latter had tried to manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a claim for restitution in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a particular candidate.
The latter had to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For now I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for insider trading in a public tender and competition." said for the newspaper Pravo the head of the prosecutor's office of Plzen Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more explanations because the investigation is ongoing.
The police released the 46-year-old entrepreneur after 24 hours.
As to how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate in view of the so little official information.
In response to a question from Pravo, Land Fund spokeswoman Lubomira Cerna said that the police had actually made an arrest in Plzen at a separate workplace during the public competition.
"This was a customer and not an employee," she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has the real name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land according to the Land Law" and is set up when several candidates who benefit from rights come forward.
"These persons propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to resitutions which must be settled before the value of the land is announced".
"According to the proposed rights a ranking of the purchasers is put in place and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," explained the spokesman of the Fund.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information concerning the persons who had registered for the call and as he himself is also a beneficiary because having purchased a large number of rights to restitutions, he had proposed to the candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And he was probably cashing in by withdrawing.
This would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts well above the standards at the FdT (Fonds des Terrains).
It was included in the case of the former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted in criminal proceedings for having published land for which the decision to set up a building had already been published.
For example, Lubos G. had obtained land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place where the access artery to the Borske Pole industrial estate was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far higher.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it risked jeopardizing the construction by blocking the land.
Households will pay an extra 100 crowns monthly for housing.
Households from January will have to pay extra not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
From January, families will therefore have to draw from their wallets up to a hundred crowns monthly more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity for apartment households is expected to be around 100 crowns more than at present.
However, all suppliers have lowered electricity prices given the significant development to encourage the manufacture of renewable energies, especially photovoltaic cells.
Gas increases moderately but of course when people need it most to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
We can therefore also count a hundred crowns more.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest municipalities that plan the price increase.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 crowns more per month, families in Libérec will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For Prague residents is preparing a 9 percent increase for water and sanitation in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If rents do not change the people of Prague will pay an extra 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest in comparison with the whole country.
In North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are rising by 7.4 percent.
Rent prices will increase significantly for example in the 450 thousand rental apartments from January, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns almost 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase it up to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with the new rent increase will be taken to court by the company.
The regulated rents that people pay in nearly 300,000 apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
Czech children get drunk on rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts slowly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from the parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who get drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in hospital for recurrence are no exception.
This is the result of the experience of physicians who encounter cases similar to admissions from children's departments in hospitals.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be drunk."
"The trend is really towards strong alcohol," says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, head of the children's department at the hospital in Horovice in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to steal a bottle from the cupboard, it is sometimes wisky but it is fernet and vodka that prevail."
"Vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not smell it," says the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokeswoman for the Motel Hospital, also agrees with him.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"It's now the fashionable alcohol, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was slivovice that they brought back from home," Jurinova added.
According to Department Chief Pélikan, seeing drunk children between the ages of thirteen and fourteen at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he practiced ten years precisely in pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren from the wide area completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times.
"She began her career at the age of twelve when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in her blood with the addition of a mixture with ecstasy," described the doctor.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Centre at a party."
"What is interesting is that it did not seem strange to the mother that her daughter was absent 48 hours," says the Director of the Department astonished.
It is precisely the disinterest of parents or their extraordinary tolerance in the face of the fact that their offspring indulge in drinking that are the main cause of the development of alcoholism in children.
According to specialists, however, we are not talking about dependence, in its strict sense, for children.
"Under the term alcoholic we mean a chronic dependence on alcohol of several years with all the phenomena that result from it but that we do not find in children".
"In those who use the acool repeatedly, it is rather a socio-family back-ground significantly unfavorable," explained the Head of Department Pélikan.
According to spokeswoman Jurinova, about forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with severe intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are after emergency care brought home by parents or police, are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit down and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pelikan, there are three seasonal waves to which we can reck: Witches' Day, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink out of spite after bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"Of course I experienced on Witches' Day an admission of 7 drunk children all at once," Pelikan said.
The drunk child who spent the night in the hospital in detoxification under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned home and suffers the next day from the "hangover".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are better off because they have a great evening and then a sweet awakening and nothing hurts them."
"They are only amazed at where they are," adds Pelikan, knowing that from time to time it spoils the good mood of patients at least with the bill to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and intensive care bed hospitalization can cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I applied this as a means of education by counting on these children how much their drunkenness cost and that they could spend the whole summer in seasonal work to pay back a single evening," Pelikan added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their declining management, which should recover from parents the costs related to care, do not deal with cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L-159 aircraft of the five in all, for which the Ministry of Defense exchanged Casa C-295M transport planes, took off Tuesday for Seville in Spain where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is headquartered.
This is the first time that aircraft of this type have become the property of anyone other than the Czech army.
Yet they have been abroad as part of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seat versions of the L-159T1 that were until now in service with the Czech Army and were airworthy.
The three remaining aircraft are single-seat versions of the L-159.
These are currently parked at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the firm Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Press Department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure of the Vodochody planes is currently unknown.
"The single-seat L-159 aircraft planned for the exchange were taken from aircraft that had been stored for a long time without causing additional burdens or investments for the Ministry of Defense."
"The L-159 T1 two-seaters were exchanged in the state," Pejsek told Pravo.
He added that the army will not remain without a two-seater since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused L-159 single-seaters into two two-seaters.
The military took delivery of the first aircraft in July, with the second scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS is committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of some Allied countries.
"In the contract it is clearly stated that the one who takes the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will be used for the training of pilots from NATO member countries."
"It is therefore a matter for whoever takes into account how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by Mirek Topomanek's government.
The Ministry of Defence did not issue a call for tenders and contacted EADS directly.
the Directorate of Defence argued that the exchange ensured a future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and uses only 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will likely have legal implications.
however, the European Commission has lodged a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence with the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been chosen as part of an EU-wide tender and under no circumstances by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
An index finger longer than the ring finger is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have an index finger longer than their ring finger are at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple risk test for prostate cancer, especially for men before the age of 60," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, including combining with genetic risk or other aggravating factors like family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Great Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the index finger of their right hand shorter than their ring fingers.
For them, as for the 19 per cent of those who had fingers of the same length, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
In the case of those who had the index finger longer than the ring finger the risk fell to 33 percent, for men before 60 years the decrease in risk reached 87 percent.
The length ratio of the two fingers mentioned - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research has shown that it is precisely testosterone that helps in the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is aware of the study but that it does not seem to him, it seems, that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "fully demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
Czechia, like most of Europe, is covered by snow on Thursday morning.
On roads and sidewalks, there is mostly compact snow, the clearers have worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd kilometer in the direction of Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 road in Brno towards Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (UAMK) told the news
At the 91st kilometer a truck was accidented, at the 93rd two trucks collided, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at the 185th kilometer towards Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers should exit just after Brno at the 190th kilometer or go through Brno and then enter at the 182nd kilometer in Kyvalka.
A line of cars several kilometers long formed at this point.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Queues of cars are created for example in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also clogged.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
For example, trams are lagging behind on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning the Prague Crisis Staff has yet to meet.
The railway tracks and the airport are also experiencing problems.
Czech Railways has already had to cancel 7 fast connections due to snow.
The lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should be in control of the current situation.
Ruzyne airport has been closed since Wednesday 11:00 in the night until 5 am.
Most roads in South Moravia are already rollable but with extra vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impassable, on the road to Brno there begin to be in places gusts of snow and on the road to Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass certain lines of communication in the places placed above.
The Vyskov region was among the most affected places.
Until now are closed the axes: Rusinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them it may be necessary to send snowplows and snow cutters.
We cannot yet estimate when they will be rollable.
On the road to Hodonin, caution is required in the region of the White Carpathians.
On roads that are, with regard to nature protection, maintained only by spraying inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow, warns CTK.
In the Czech Republic, between two and 10 centimetres of snow fell; it fell the most in northern Bohemia, often with up to 18 centimetres of snow.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimetres of snow fell.
Snow cover is gradually disappearing in the Czech Republic.
Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The US military has sent a new "smart" weapon to Afghanistan, known only by the code name XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and "change the game" to their advantage.
The new weapon is like a super accurate barrel
Its projectiles are laser guided with an accuracy of a few meters.
The special 25 mm caliber ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly shattering explosive, actually works like small grenades.
The munitions can be programmed in such a way that they will explode on contact with the target but also at any point on their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, wall or ditch.
He is also not protected from above and when he falls on a deadly rain of steel shrapnel, it can put him out of action as well.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "smart" technology.
"The soldier basically uses it in such a way that he finds the target, sends it a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtaining a precise aiming point, according to which he corrects his site aim and pulls the trigger.
"Let's say you aimed at 543 meters."
"When you pull the trigger, the gun loads and fires at a distance of 543 meters plus or minus 1, 2, 3 meters," Audette said.
400 jobs relocated
The Fujitsu Group relocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will move their workplace to Astro Park, which is currently located in the office building on Mareinbader Square in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer manufacturing and maintenance giant said on Wednesday, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located until now on Marienbader Square in the city of Bad Homburg, will be moved to Astro Park, a huge office complex on Lyoner Straße in Frankfurt's Niederrad district.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu said that in the medium term, the group should consolidate 100 other jobs still scattered so far in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive. In addition, Astro Park's open-plan offices are better suited to the way employees work.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
Managing Director Bernd Wagner said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location for us with a remarkable infrastructure."
He says the connection to the airport is of great importance to a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again a "global player" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relating to the location".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its location is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
Management informed the municipality of this intention at an early stage.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer vis-à-vis the owner of the building on Marienbader Square.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a question of preventing such an exceptional place from remaining unoccupied for a long time.
"I am hopeful that the owner and lessor of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building on City Hall Square, previously used by the Fujitsu company and the "small vertical" next door, as well as the rest of the buildings on Marienbad Square, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
The result of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and the Town Hall. This provoked much criticism, not only because of the impressive layout of the surfaces that were once partly used as a car park, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment advisory firm, Feri, the manufacturer of computers for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, a computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Frankfurt group Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the real estate fund Morgan Stanley. A year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Group considers itself the third largest supplier of IT products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides essential services.
Its branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has many more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, moves from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad. Other subsidiaries on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, houses among other things the headquarters of the Confederation of the Electronic and Electrical Engineering Industry.
Amazon Kicks Server - Threats Against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is finding more and more difficulty.
Internet service provider Amazon has expelled from its servers the site specializing in the revelation of confidential documents.
This attitude may conceal political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr Assange, is apparently staying in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks website is under attack with ever greater force.
The cyber-activist group "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server previously hosted in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is likely staying in Britain, according to newspaper reports.
"Wikileaks excluded from Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the land of freedom," said Wednesday (local time) the cyber-activists behind the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Shortly before, the cyber company, Amazon, had deleted the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the secret diplomatic notes were published, the cyber activists resorted to Amazon's Web Service (AWS) in order to achieve the greatest number of accesses to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Great, our dollars are now being spent on caring for people in Europe."
When free speech is a problem for Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
CNN, citing Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon banned Wikileaks from using its servers after an investigation by Sen. Joe Lieberman's aides.
The chairman of the Senate Committee for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian".
"I wish Amazon had taken this step sooner given Wikileaks' previous releases of classified information," the senator said.
At the same time, Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the platform's use of servers.
"Wikileaks is acting illegally, monstrously and unscrupulously. In doing so, it puts our national security at risk and endangers lives around the world," the independent senator said in a statement.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks disseminate the contents of stolen documents."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
According to reports by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently described Sweden's lawsuits against him as intrigues orchestrated by his critics.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats had been made against the site.
"Calls have even been made for the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange particularly fears for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to go into hiding.
Hrafnsson was clearly reacting to statements made in North America.
In America, former Republican Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee demanded that those responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's adviser said on television, obviously ironically, that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a drone."
Meanwhile, a controversy has erupted between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for US President Barack Obama, described as "ridiculous and absurd" that Mr Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and disclosed just recently, to engage in espionage activities.
"I'm not sure why we have to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website," Gibbs says.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website."
The U.S. government is now completely testing the protection of its databases.
According to a White House statement, Mr. Russell Travers, deputy director of the Center for Counterterrorism, has been named in charge of countering the leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for implementing "the necessary structural reforms" made necessary after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House is also willing to audit the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the US government has announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they are ever threatened by the Wikileaks revelations.
"We have made every effort to get in touch with them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
Ice University
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where does all the ice come from?
From the Glacier and the ice machine.
The ice cream parlour, that is to say in German the somewhat old-fashioned ice confectioner, makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice making.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated display case using a spatula, places it in the waffle and then starts selling it.
To find out, one does not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream can't avoid "Gelato-University" by Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of ice cream makers founded the Ice University in 2003 so that the ice creams coming out of its machines everywhere meet the high Italian ideals.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
There are also special chocolate ice cream courses spanning several days. Similarly, practical sessions are organized in the private ice cream shop.
In the midst of a midlife crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply venture to fulfill their burning desire on smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants came from 19 countries on all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia and Hungary.
Jacky, an art education teacher from California, is passionate about the Slow Food movement. In the future, he wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and after a few years she wants to get something unique out of this nerve-wracking job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housekeeper came because her kids love Italian ice cream.
Master ice cream maker Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice cream.
Determining is not only the good flavor, but also the silky suppleness and consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the icing on the cake of the national and, in general, southern superstructure: "Italian ice cream is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender that heats everything to 85 degrees through an electronic program, then immediately cools to four degrees.
He then opens a tap installed on the machine: he takes out a white cream of pasteurized base, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately assailed with questions: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can we give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of the times.
Anyone who only talks about ice cream "made from natural ingredients", may have nevertheless used stabilizers: most often a natural product, for example, guar seed flour obtained from guar bean.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will bite nothing but ice pellets.
Some modifications to the base mass are permitted.
It gets more exciting with the aromas.
Master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that are acquired in the fruit or confectionery section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powder and pasta.
"Suppliers will all try to pass dozens of flavored ingredients back to you."
"However, you should just try."
Either in the recipes of fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs, becomes a yellow cream and constitutes, when cocoa powder is added, the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now all course participants must switch to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
Different kinds of fruit ice cream are also subjected to the same experiment.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purees: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily have the taste of nuts, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
The popular kiwi ice cream is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly enhances the taste of an ice cream," says Luciano.
Making ice cream is a calculation exercise: if peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is required for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents a device with which he determines the sugar content of different types of fruit (winemakers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, tables make calculations easier.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires, as in the past, as much physical intervention.
It's not just the automatic base mass manufacturing machine that helps.
There is also a device in which the available ice mixture is simultaneously beaten to make it creamy and brought back to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automations, slight breakdowns are not excluded.
Brazil's Gustavo smears fruit puree from head to toe and splashes his classmates when control of the colossal mixing bowl eludes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that "such an incident is likely to occur during every class: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry experimenting with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has infiltrated the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now being made by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an independent institute for assessing the consequences of biotechnology.
"This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well informed," Testbiotech Director Christoph Then said Wednesday in Munich.
There are reports that the Chair of the EFSA Expert Group on Genetically Modified Plants, Mr Harry Kuiper, and other EFSA experts are under contract with the lobby group Ilsi.
The latter is financed by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Kuiper was instrumental in developing EFSA's testing requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest, according to Then's criticism.
The regulations drawn up correspond verbatim, in paragraphs, to the positions adopted by the pressure group Ilsi and thus bear the mark of the industry which, basically, is controlled by the authorities based in Parma, Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech has denounced a conflict of interest.
A senior EFSA official recently joined the Swiss food group Syngenta unconditionally or without a transitional period. In doing so, She changed sides.
Not long ago, even Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union supervisory authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused the suspicions of both the German Federal Environment Agency and MEPs.
However, EFSA does not accept the existence of any conflict of interest.
One opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, is used as long as it is of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of EFSA are not prohibited from establishing contacts with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Kuiper admits he works for the US-based International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI).
This body sees itself as a neutral forum bringing together experts from the fields of science, industry and policy and others to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the pay of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr Then disagree that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feeding tests and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what, for example, the impact of genetically modified maize causes in the field," says Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not allow for reliable results.
"If we don't look for risks, how can we discover them?" asks Mr. Then accusatoryly.
This is also the view of Ms. Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientist has been conducting research in the field of genetics since 1994 and currently works at the Zurich University of Technology.
In this region, as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
This is why there are hardly any researchers who are not linked to companies.
In the opinion of the companies, critical studies would not be published.
Hilbeck says "industry controls safety research."
The stone trace
Uli Gsell bought it, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of the Stuttgart train station with her tube on her back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: By September, the excavators had come and started demolishing much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Several thousand people demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart Central Station into an underground station that will cost billions.
Much of the wing was in ruins when protests halted construction.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (shell limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse pavement badly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
He obtained some fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthusiastically declares: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and earthly."
He claims that when he cut it with a saw, he smelled the smell of cigarette smoke.
He does not yet know what he will do with this fragment.
Rocks have time.
So did Uli Gsell.
the traces of the Stuttgart stones lead to a former ammunition depot of the French army in a forest near Tubingo, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or disappeared into the landfill," he said in his office in a hut, once a guard post.
He says he was insulted and threatened when newspapers reported in September that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that there was nothing he could do at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it takes place, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
About 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took away one of the stone parallelepipeds weighing an average of 80 kilos whose value is between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir in while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half are still crammed into the forest, the rest long since sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, Individuals.
They came from everywhere and took away everything that could fit in the trunk and trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long since turned into "Mäuerle" or limitations of grass beds.
"By the way, this stone is nothing special," says Mr. Rongen.
"Had it not been for this political component."
He gets into his all-terrain car, goes around his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He studied law and dropped out. Later, he set out to study biology before later becoming interested in computer science and eventually becoming a quarryman.
And a lover of stones.
It stores 40,000 tons.
He amassed treasures all over Germany.
He claims that he is the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He restrains himself.
Artfully carved sand stones are laid on the snow.
"They were once part of the Marienbrücke bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he says enthusiastically.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that climbs through the forest.
He points to a bunch: Red sand stone, previously, part of Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Nice travertine."
The parallelepiped was once part of the grandstand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, travertine from Cannstatt from the police headquarters, reddish granite from St. Blasian Cathedral, tuff from Heilbronn Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that once stones were carved by hand and moved using simple hoists and ox-drawn carts, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such heritage were torn to pieces."
He did not become rich, let alone rich.
But this carrier now employs 14 people. In addition, stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a gardener settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's rewarding," says the waste recycler.
He is due to go to Cologne soon.
There, too, there are stones to save.
Talent struggle to conquer high potentials
The counter is very busy.
16 students jostle to buy salmon rolls, tomato sauce and whiteeats.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited the design and mechanical engineering students to a workshop.
As part of a kind of ideas competition, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW designers, and, by the way, get to know the Volkswagen firm.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go hand to hand in the competition to find better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most talented graduates as much as possible in lecture halls before they enter the job market and are courted by others.
And since universities don't publish statements about their students' performance, we try to identify exceptional talent in practical projects and retain them.
On the second day of the workshop held at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the automotive group is coaxing talent.
A young lady from the personnel department shares pens, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the calendar of professional internships and student jobs to young talents; She shows them the ways to access the group's compound.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen Group, it can get to know the students, take a closer look at serious candidates and appreciate those who come into play as an employee."
According to Mr. Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What is new is the offensive with which we are trying to attract students.
"In the past, the focus was more on the professional project," says Selle.
The fight for new graduates will become much more bitter.
In many sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by screening a host of candidates.
But they must boast of their reliability and above all court the highly qualified workforce.
It is especially graduates from engineering fields who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German engineering association VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the vacuum for engineering positions will grow even bigger.
Roman Dykta hunts for talent on behalf of KPMG, an audit, accounting and consulting firm.
It organizes expensive events aimed at recruiting talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise, a kind of paper rally where competitors must find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel the United States in this way.
Participants can also visit KPMG subsidiaries and get to know the company.
The person who is to participate decides in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the crème de la crème of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Dykta, the means used to quest for high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to stand out from the crowd through the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
For the talent hunter that is Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"Until today, we have kept in touch with all the people who took part in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to send their applications to our company soon." Saying.
Apart from the direct co-operation on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises proceed in a completely classic way by participating in trade fairs where they engage in brain hunting.
"We try to reach graduates by participating in trade shows."
"For example, at the solar technology fair," says Sitha Stübe, human resources director at Solarworld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe is aware of the issue of succession.
Currently, 35 positions are being advertised on the company's website.
"Right now, it's very difficult to fill vacancies."
"It's expensive and time-consuming," he said.
Another way to establish contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"The professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to do professional internships or write his final project with us."
Expensive advertising campaigns are advertised among solar specialists.
That's why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often a large group can't do that," says Stübe, head of personnel.
It's been a long time since money played the main role in the job search.
Other determining factors include flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among Germany's top 100 employers.
The institute is an annual honour roll of German employers.
To this end, it asks employees about their degree of satisfaction with their work and its context while looking at the framework conditions of employees.
Head of Personnel Ms. Stübe hopes that this placement will enhance the company's image among jobseekers.
"I think candidates mostly rely on external assessments when it comes to a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Akademie (DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Kriegler, that means, first and foremost, taking internal action.
"The best way for an employer to make itself attractive is through its own employees," he says.
This is called, in industry jargon, internal image strategy, which is the creation of the employer's brand within its own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best messengers."
When you treat your employees well and they identify with the company, they advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing in an orchestra," says Kriegler.
Obama puts brakes on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, a southeastern state of the United States, in the coming years.
The government in Washington imposed an equivalent ban and, thus, permanently cancelled its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited for the time being.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement Wednesday.
It was the explosion in April of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" that caused this strict ban. It must remain in force for at least the next five years.
Faced with this accident, which claimed the lives of eleven employees and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated that he was willing to authorize the realization of new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents of this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries for oil supplies.
The question of who bears responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf has not, to date, been definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing multi-billion compensation claims, is at the center of the accusations.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted a drilling freeze imposed after the platform exploded.
Following this decision, various oil groups immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter safety guidelines, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another catastrophe.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after numerous accusations of corruption, is currently undergoing in-depth reforms.
At the same time, Obama announced that they would eliminate the lucrative tax loopholes of oil and gas groups.
Industry players are now publicly warning that the feed rate in the Gulf is significantly lower than has been the case so far.
"The government's objective is to curb the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector," according to the results of a current survey conducted in the sector by the audit firm BDO, ahead of the drilling ban on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows what exactly will change with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing in the rivers is oiled brown; It has a smell similar to that which exists in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of liters of crude oil destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live on theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't exhaust yourself," the environmental activist tells reporters to calm them down: "You still have enough oil mud in front of the duckweed."
The 37-year-old Nigerian attempted to photograph a young man sunk into the chest-deep muddy water, as well as the greasy trail that surrounds him: This scene looks almost beautiful in the rainbow-colored burst of water.
You can't see that the subsoil is full of brown slicks of crude oil.
On the bank of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom says she used to collect shrimp in whole buckets here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil spilled from an exploded pipeline in the huge swamp.
Fishermen living in the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach the fish-rich waters: The Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The full extent of the devastation is obvious when you walk through the mangrove marshes crossed by rivers.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat splits a filthy brown water. Whoever plunges his hand into it removes it all covered with oil.
The roots of mangrove cubs emerge from the ground like licorice sticks. The isolated palm trees sadly let their palms hang.
We search in vain for flocks of birds, as we usually meet in wetlands: As soon as the outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence falls on this paradise of yesteryear that resembles a gas station by the smell it gives off.
"What is happening here is a war against the environment," says Mr. Celestine Akpobari sadly: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The area where the Ogoni live has been a battlefield besieged for decades: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. He was later executed. In 1993, the Shell Group had to stop its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the return to the Ogoni country is forbidden to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 drilling wells and 7000 kilometers of pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are unexploited,  Because the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
Every few hundred meters steel trestles stand in the water like strange sculptures: The heads of boreholes are very affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees".
They are up to 50 years old, most are eaten away by corrosion to the mark.
Akpobari believes that a drill head of this nature occasionally breaks into pieces, as a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion liters have spilled on the ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil equivalent to that which flowed into the sea during the accident of the super-tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Who should bear responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell Group, sabotage and siphoning of oil pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, see drillhead explosions and perforated pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, the American researcher Richard Steiner criticized the Shell group for applying in Nigeria safety standards essentially less stringent than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of pipe failures is "still much higher than pace".
Some forms emerge from the mangroves in a place that, seen from a distance, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of sludge and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with sludge up to their necks.
A fire sparkles under one of the many barrels that sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without reason on the site must be repeated: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
First, gasoline enters a container through pipes, then at the end of the pipe drops of kerosene fall and finally diesel is obtained.
This is how Michael and his four collaborators produce four 300-liter diesel drums daily: "It brings us 34,000 Naira", about 22 dollars.
Delta residents are taking advantage of chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil-producing country in sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a cheaper price than the ridiculously low one of barely 40 euro cents per liter of diesel: because they acquire their raw material for free.
it is offered by the "protectors" who put the network of pipelines in drilling throughout the land of the Ogoni. According to experts, the country loses at least 16 million liters of crude oil in the entire Niger Delta in this way.
Only a small, completely insignificant part of the temporarily stored raw material is illegally purified: Organized crime networks, which also include politicians and high-ranking military personnel, load the lion's share into tankers and sell it off on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers the debate about whether to attribute the environmental catastrophe or rather subversive activities to the population or the lax mode of production to be purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of fishermen's lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refineries."
But in the meantime, the Ogoni's relations, especially vis-à-vis Shell, deteriorated so much that it was only a question of the group's withdrawal. "Maybe operators with other nationalities, like the Chinese, will turn out to be better."
Then Michael gets nervous.
"It's high time you left," the sturdy oil worker announced.
"Soldiers can appear at any time."
If illegal refiners are caught by special units of the armed forces, they will not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribes.
Even soldiers, especially from the north of the country, intend to benefit from raw materials like all Nigerians.
"By any measure, this damn thing has brought our country down," Akpori said.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 engines
The A380 clearly suffers from a major safety problem.
While examining an aircraft that made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction defect that can lead to "catastrophic reactor failure."
The airline Qantas now wants to file a complaint against the manufacturer of the engine.
At the beginning of November, the passengers of the Airbus belonging to the company Quantas had obviously been more fortunate so far: During the investigation it conducted, the Australian aviation safety authority found that the engines of some A380 aircraft presented a serious safety problem, and it warns of a possible construction defect.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in the connection of the oil line, says a position paper published Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have led to a "catastrophic failure of the reactors".
This concerns the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce and equipping 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
The Airbus of the company Quantas, which had to land urgently on November 4 in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British engine manufacturer.
She filed a legal complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney. This gives him the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas director Alan Joyce said his company would seek damages in connection with the incident in early November.
Parts came loose and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the ignition of oil that is causing the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety-related tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security issue is considered important enough to inform all parties involved.
After the emergency landing of its plane, the airline Quantas grounded its entire fleet of A380s for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily grounded three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa has replaced the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-decker aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall throughout the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany all covered in white: In one night, snow fell on almost the entire country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany shiver: In freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, which leads to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, snow cover reaches 15 centimeters in places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several highways and on many roads.
On the A7 in Flensburg, the winter service staff worked permanently, but they could not overcome the snow that kept accumulating.
In addition, violent gusts swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects tidal waves to occur on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow piles on motorways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the weather warning center Meteomedia announced the purple alert level was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In places, 30 centimetres of fresh snow fell that the strong and cool winds dispersed.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities have announced serious disruptions on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused traffic disruption and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall affected the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious disruptions to rail traffic occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on railways, fallen trees on railway tracks, catenaries or needles destroyed.
In Saxony, interregional transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be discontinued.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train bound for Munich had to interrupt its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the train's 165 passengers with blankets, food and drink.
Snow winds swept through the roads.
The snowfall has led to numerous flight cancellations at Germany's main airports.
According to a spokesperson for the switchboard and flight information, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
A Fraport spokesperson says 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that passengers stuck at the airport are no longer numerous, despite this barely 400 beds are made available to them.
Accidents occurred Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train driver sustained minor injuries.
Due to the layers of snow on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was hit at a level crossing because the vehicle was stopped there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the early hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car rolled over on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce good news: The snow will certainly still be soft and powdery, but it will swirl in case of light gusts.
But, the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by strong and fast winds.
However, it is very cold, up to minus 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
Deutsche Bank is seeking to part with its emblem: According to newspaper reports, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its Frankfurt headquarters.
This building could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just embellished the group's headquarters: The twin towers located in the Business District have been modernized; In the meantime, the bankers had to return to their former place of service.
Now, the financial group is clearly looking to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not say the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we are checking whether it is more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or to sell them, and to rent them again later".
As a result, Germany's largest financial institution has already relinquished its headquarters shortly thereafter.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank acquired the twin towers for an amount of 272 million euros from equity holders. They then rehabilitated them.
Transformations aimed at energy optimisation have, according to some indications, swallowed up around EUR 200 million.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector of activity estimate the value of the towers, renamed in the meantime "Green Towers", at about 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesman, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn the miners who perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of buried miners who were pronounced dead following several mine explosions.
The bodies had not yet been recovered because the security situation of the stricken well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been inserted into the stricken well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue team was able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that the miners no longer had any chance of survival.
Until now, the bodies could not be reassembled.
Today, relatives and friends organized a party in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a bright sun in Greymouth in the south of the New Zealand island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 buried miners, 29 tables were set up on which names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal belongings, including clothes and surfboards, also had their place.
Flags were flown at half-mast in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the memorial party that New Zealand had raised hopes that the miners would rise to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pits, said he cannot resign himself to accepting his son's death until he sees his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Miners of South African and British origin were also buried in the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescuers have begun extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine in New Zealand's South Island.
Police Commissioner Gary Knowles told reporters that when the masses of explosive gas are moved, the scorching temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter movie an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the ancient genre with his film, "Walhalla Rising", an epic of the fighter.
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) possessing only one eye is taken prisoner; He frees himself from his executioner and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male viewers looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal assassination methods. When he is in a bad mood, he tears out the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to be dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the one-eyed man says no word about his real name. Even the other characters let out, at most, at the turn of one or two sentences a few cries of terrible agony.
Otherwise, we say nothing and feast in the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland that is the setting of the Viking universe, about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travelling.
When a film targets several target groups, it is a pity that they are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been considered, since the release of "Pusher," his trilogy about the fierce and stylish drug dealer, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to arthouse cinema.
Most supporters of art cinema must feel horror at the brain that spreads all around and the intestines.
Action movie lovers die of boredom when the one-eyed man embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by calm and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to remain silent.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" has not found any film distributor in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
This is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that deserved some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It's not about dialogue in this film, nor about coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream turned into a film.
The viewer cannot escape it.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with icy images and a gloomy soundtrack, but mostly with an elusive hatred that springs from the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who stands faithfully by the one-eyed man, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the one-eyed hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by transforming himself into a warrior, is perhaps sent by the devil himself.
It represents decay, but perhaps also, just for those who are, anyway, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, which aims at annoyance, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications of a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, let alone submit to the agency's controls.
On the night of 5-6 September 2007 at around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It lies on the bank of the Euphrates; the largest city located nearby is 30 kilometers away: it is Dair as-Sur.
His name appears in IAEA documents because it refers to the reactor that Syria has built apparently with the help of North Korea in stone parallelepiped, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a briefing by the United States intelligence services, the CIA, dating from late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighboring locality, el-Kibar, would be well suited to produce plutonium, which would make it possible to manufacture atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video featuring blurry satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the likely location of each reactor component before the destruction of the plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, or even the interior of it.
It appears that the reactor was about to be commissioned, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is little more information than then, and even, with time, the mystery thickens more and more.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to the attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor at el-Kibar, but had little evidence that Syria was developing "an active nuclear weapons program."
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of an "alleged reactor", even if they consider the CIA's presentation "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how he ensures he is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior UN diplomat gave only a terse answer in the summer, saying the IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions."
The Syrians certainly hastily removed the rubble of the "unused military building" and proceeded to methodically level the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts, led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen, discovered traces of man-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial contractors from a member State showing the moment directly following the attack. it seems that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, possibly Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always maintained that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus maintains that the uranium found at the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after the analysis of the particles as implausible.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss this, as well as satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to carry out a second inspection at the el-Kibar site and refuses access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then sitting prime minister at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this."
Thus, the investigation into this case has dragged on since June 2008 without reaching a result and "is increasingly turning into a serious problem of the Agency's credibility", as a senior Western diplomat serving at IAEA headquarters in Vienna acknowledges, ultimately it is a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA considers that in order to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the other three facilities that must have a "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities are involved, what their function is or what they are suspected of containing.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah respectively also from the names of neighboring cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington identified these locations and found on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It is possible that it is in a military base or directly next to it; that is exactly why Syria is denying IAEA inspectors access to the three sites.
In Vienna, it is claimed that the Syrians fear that the inspection group is in fact spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
In fact, it is intelligence provided by U.S. secret agents that attracts the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have shuttled between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "be used for fuel production."
It would have "no indications of sensitive activities", such as uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are indispensable for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works on unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible hypotheses about the following fundamental questions: where should the uranium have come from and where the plutonium needed to make the bomb would later have been separated.
It is not known whether the rubble, which could hide valuable traces, was stored at the three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks loaded with earth are gone, no one will have any information about where the rubble is stored.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometers from el-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates River, examined in 1998 to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
By recently analyzing satellite photos taken for the famous Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked them to the reactor in question.
Satellite photos, however, show that Syria undertook earthworks at the three suspect sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to those locations.
It is possible that this was a coincidence, but it did not help to dispel suspicions.
In diplomatic circles, it is said that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections to be carried out there. This plan was to allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only the time invested shows how interested the inspectors are in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also ignored this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported on the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be reported for this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the US ambassador who has been talking for some months about what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means the Atomic Agency has to implement its controls.
The director of the IAEA, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
This means carries an enormous risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and many of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation escalate.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who gives food for thought: "Would it be useful if in the end they find nothing"
Love in Wartime
It's been going badly since Angelina Jolie made her summer debut as a director.
She wrote the screenplay herself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
Nothing more is known about this story, but it is enough to cause unease.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested. In response, some filming sequences planned for Sarajevo were moved at the last minute to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests are still going on in Bosnia.
According to reports in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the Women's War Victims Organization sent a letter to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and demanded to meet the actress. Jolie is a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador herself.
She is not a diplomat. A few weeks ago, she proposed to these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's script says a lot about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization subsequently recommended that the UN High Commission revoke Jolie's status as Goodwill Ambassador.
But, by the way, what kind of script did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of his script, granted after some hesitation a permission to shoot in Sarajevo, but it is not known why did not then come despite this authorization.
The young author herself assures that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that it is by making a lot of effort that she became aware of the Yugoslav conflict. She argues that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of war and give all stakeholders the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the war began. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is still a big difference with the version "a rape victim falls in love with her tormentor".
That Jolie's film began long before the war, of course.
The pressure on her, as Jolie puts it, is "unfair and based on misinformation."
From now on, only Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: By illegally putting this scenario on the Net, like many others before.
Let's shoot!
Tonight, all is well again with the Irish.
No trace of dismay.
This is why the home team excessively dominates visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans scream with joy against the background of loud music, they stumble their feet.
Baileyu-Pub in Cork, Southern Ireland vibrates because players throw and manage to drop table tennis balls from a distance of three meters into beer cups of the opposing team.
This bizarre spectacle is called "beer pong". The winner pockets 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to attend the World Beer Pong Championship in Las Vegas in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; This subtle drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really do not go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the stubborn question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not in his plans. In January, he will conduct job interviews in New Zealand.
"I have a strange feeling, though," he says.
"The homeland is so far away and I don't have a job there."
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "in less than two, she has landed her desired job as an event project manager, maybe a good sign" says the young man with a smile.
Because of the bleak outlook at home, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, his brother Colin now works as an IT consultant in London.
Young people are leaving: The situation of most families living on the island resembles that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute of Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even predict a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This is a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these predictions come true, it will be a flow of emigration comparable to that suffered in Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish enjoyed great affluence, grief now takes over.
However, the economic crisis is mainly affecting well-educated young Irishmen, who have so far only known moments of happiness.
Job loss and social decay seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone had a job, there is excess money.
But in the meantime, three out of ten people under the age of thirty are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper published extensively letters from readers written by young emigrants, who complained: "In Ireland, everything is adrift."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever has the chances, leaves and so does our country for a whole generation."
"The last one to leave turns off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish students' union, sees a bleak future because the government is just throwing smoke and mirrors and offering young people no prospects.
"They are reducing minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old student.
She sees how her classmates cling from one unpaid practical internship to another.
She says her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this theme positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" which offers comprehensive support on the theme of "working abroad".
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for newcomers to the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," says the official.
His website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a hassle, but it also guarantees freedom and fun.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing left for the 29-year-old engineer to do in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the German construction sector.
A fashion house is just emerging in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other projects Hannover or Berlin.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visited his native country, as he participated in an additional job so that he could complete the loan taken out to build his house in his native country.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says as he crosses the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I hardly live anymore."
He bursts out laughing embarrassedly as he walks through the cold rooms.
The small house is in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive cars of major brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house jointly with his sister for 380,000 Euros, 100 percent financed by credit.
"These were crazy moments, without a doubt, money was easy," he says.
Is he afraid of seeing everything fall apart because of credit?
O'Donovan thought for a moment, poured hot tea and declared, "I have no children to support and I am young; Even everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The building engineer does not like the lamentations he often hears lately.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not as dramatic as what we once experienced here on the island," he said.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe that's what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years there, and in Ireland life just went on."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future and discover how life goes elsewhere.
In his list, he already has a few years of work in London. That's why life doesn't have to be so easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is one more thing that worries him in recent days: the party to be organized on the occasion of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He fears that it could turn into a farewell evening.
"Only, not a lot of emotions," he says, taking a long sip of beer.
"A farewell, it still seems worrying."
"Let's call it a relaxed goodbye night with a few friends, a few drinks and a few games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the US in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro poll taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it tracks attitudinal changes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the fairly sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the Pacific of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a low of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also rose in Mexico, where the economy recovered after suffering a sharp drop in output last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are staunch democrats, pushing down the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region were satisfied with the way their country's democracy worked in practice; This is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase from 25% in 2001 (Figure 3).
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45% in their government, both the same as last year; but up sharply compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America shook support for democracy.
If this held up during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in the Americas suffered only a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty rose only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year, to 32 percent.)
But the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see Figure 4).
Brazil's strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a widely shared sense of progress.
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and violent crime has worsened.
This is only the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
About 31% say they or a relative have been the victim of a crime in the past year; Nevertheless, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for private enterprise and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela feel this way (and 80% support private enterprise); even if their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the biggest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (up from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% from last year).
But the U.S. is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, and Nicaragua.
A tainted vote
No one expected to have a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the stricken and fear-ridden country.
Ballot boxes and a new ballot were presented, ballots scattered in gutters, polling stations ransacked and intimidation was presented.
Polling stations opened late at night.
Many Hataians, including many who were displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged frontrunners, denounced the fraud and called for the election to be annulled.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior United Nations official in Haiti, considers the event "a pretty good election in many ways."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they "did not believe that these irregularities, however serious, had necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared void.
But there may be problems if Mr Celestin, who has little or no discernible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority to have reached the second round and reached the second round.
With a cholera outbreak raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so due to disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, needed to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The stakes are high.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in Haiti's reconstruction.
And so, it is clear, Haitians do it themselves.
Tiptoe to the center
The weeks after suddenly becoming a widow, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, enjoyed a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rating by 20 points, to more than 50%; This is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning that into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on whether or not Fernández will abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to craft budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the extra income at will.
Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has descended into disarray following Mr. Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement have rallied to Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where one parliamentarian punched one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president even more room to spend at will.
The economy is vastly overheating: it is likely to grow by nearly 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and union wage demands see this figure close to 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared economic collapse, has made growth and poverty reduction a priority, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged INDEC, the statistical office, which falsified official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18 percent.
The economy has been boosted by high world prices for Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded the boost to growth following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Ms. Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused an earlier forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not paid its maturities in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve IMF surveillance, as is customary.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index; which looks like a prelude to INDEC's remediation.
It is unclear whether Fernández wants to stay in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer by her side.
If it does, it needs to win support from the middle class, among whom Kirchnerism is much advocated.
When Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have ebbed.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to quietly repudiate many of her husband's policies.
Half a hurrah for China
Taiwanese voters are moving towards some sort of closer union with the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters turned out on Nov. 27, or 70 percent of those eligible, to elect mayors and city councilors in five urban districts, in what is seen as a general assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Ma himself has become a substitute for mainland sentiments, having forged innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the biggest reorganization of relations with China proper since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just right.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party won three of the five mayoralties, he failed to win a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which leaned toward full Taiwan independence, won nearly 50 percent of all votes for the KMT by 45 percent.
If it had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in city councils.
The event unveiled most of the main topics of Taiwan's elections, including rowdy campaign trucks and mass rally flags with girls dancing in minimal attire.
A mandatory mysterious assassination attempt was also perpetrated.
Sean Lien, son of KMT honorary president Lien Chan, conducted an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd shot young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, wounding him and killing a bystander.
Oddly, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the PDP leader, the murder had consequences for the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking how the question of the mainland itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates toyed with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threat from China.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from whipping up anti-China sentiment.
It is the response to a new realization that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan's economic survival.
Ma, for his part, demanded confirmation as to whether his China policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
The Beijing government can be expected to continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan back home.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Certainly, she would also like to see political integration; But let's start at the beginning.
It is better to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, it was bad: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur in favor of explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under Ms. Tsai's leadership, and the PDP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP presidential candidate, as was Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that it too can engage with Beijing.
Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided their talks can take place without preconditions.
Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party presents a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Tsai's hasty approach. Ma on China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement released from his cell, he said the PDP candidates would have fared better if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will find it difficult to choose between his potential candidates.
The KMT must do some self-reflection.
The evaluations of Mr. Ma were weak; despite dizzying economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says its cabinet and local branches will be reshuffled.
The DPP's good performance suggests that Taiwan's support for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise shortlisted in the "Best New Artist" category
Perform at the request of a president, and people are required to read it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer hand-picked by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the surprises at this year's Grammy Awards with a high-profile nomination for "Best New Artist."
Considering that Spalding has been a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains a bit of a mystery but it is consistent with Grammy rules that an artist should not release more than three albums before recording; which "establishes the public identity of this artist."
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society," certainly marked a step forward and, given her slightly engaging vocal style, deft pop and funk hand, and Latin influences, it's possible to draw at least a dotted line at Spalding compared to Norah Jones' runaway hit in 2003.  the closest equivalent for Grammy voters taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "instrumental album" category, a ride on an invigorating thrill of a recording that was one of last year's all-time favorites.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a New Orleans-husky voice favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme," was honored in the contemporary jazz category; which also leans strongly towards a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of savage Darcy James Argue, familiar with steampunk, won some well-deserved recognitions in the large ensemble category; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his octet's live was a fine example of the democratic hand of this bassist as a band leader.
Grammy Award nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd annual Grammy Awards feature a mix of landscapes by musicians and composers from around the world.
Topping the nominations include Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five "yeses"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse," an electric orchestral work, with three "yeses."
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles," a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman's Madolin Concerto is also up for an award.
Classical nominations are spread over 13 categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for Classic Producer of the Year features five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classical album are Bruckner's Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" by Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the art of the Castrati" featuring various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Royal Opera House Orchestra, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse of the Ars Lyrica Houston; "Love from afar" by Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin of the Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra and Chorus; and "Ivanhoe" by Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for its solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he wrote the 15-minute work especially for mandolin performer Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a lot of scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a phone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Instrumental soloists who received nominations included pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only nominees vocalists-soloists; Here they are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical blends category, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Roots: My Life, My Song"
The Temecula Mosque project wins the approval of the planning commission.
A mosque project in Temecula has received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public, often passionate, testimony.
Critics lashed out at the project, claiming it promoted both terrorism and traffic jams.
But commissioners ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center adhered to local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to support him: Christians, Jews, Baha'is, you mention it," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, said speaking Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it, as an American citizen."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people voting for or against the center, with speaking time roughly evenly distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," one speaker wrote.
"This is another ape planet with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of 135 families has co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years but she wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a property shared with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and rise 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4.32-hectare site on Route Nicolas about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the city council.
An arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has a dual capacity."
"It can grow with either phosphorus or arsenic."
"That's why it's very special, even though it's far from being a truly 'foreign' form of life," said Paul Davies C.W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But the researchers found that the bacteria, discovered in California's Mono Lake, is able to continue growing after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"One wonders what's still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, Anbar says.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose details of the find, generated widespread speculation on the internet that the report could disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms might be able to use other elements to activate biochemistry and that the 'standard' set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, may not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute for Planetary and Space Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes.  United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it shows the substitution of one element for another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cogelll added.
This was not a serendipitous discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrology Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; Thus, she speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances might be able to substitute one for the other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to phosphorus."
"As a result, agencies have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately."
"But arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it gets inside and, in a way, erases the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic may occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; But nothing has ever shown that it can work.
Arsenic was more common early in Earth's existence, she says; Thus, the researchers hypothesized that early life forms could have used it.
This suggests that there could be other ways of forming life, not just the way life on Earth was formed in the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two show dogs stolen were found in Compton
The other two show dogs out of four stolen from outside a motel in Bellflower have been found, Los Angeles County sheriffs announced Thursday.
The four show dogs - two akitas and two Welsh pembroke corgis - went missing on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express pickup truck they had spent the night in outside a Bellflower 6 motel, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late Wednesday evening, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore told Steve Whitmore.
"The good news is that the dogs are fine," Whitmore says.
"They're in good shape."
"They have been returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say precisely where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood and what the circumstances of their discovery were.
"An investigation is ongoing."
"We don't want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
The dogs' owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached for comment Thursday.
They were reunited Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter located in Downey.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were safe and sound, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were missing until they were discovered Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the "AKC/Eukanuba" National Championship in Long Beach, where they planned to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events scheduled in the days leading up to the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple's nearly month-long dog show tour.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, right next to their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs — a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany spaniel — who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and corgis, with thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a bit, so the dogs could get fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, equipped with an implanted microchip to identify them.
It is unclear whether an award was given on Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM is only waiting for the final green light from the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start from scratch.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York on Thursday officially praised the "pre-packaged" plan by creditors that about $5 billion of debt would be written off; paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television shows.
With Thursday's ruling that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, there are no legal hurdles left for MGM to get back on track under the tutelage of Entertainment Spyglass founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the chief executives of what will be a lean studio.
The staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 at departure.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a $500 million credit facility to fund MGM's new operations and productions.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which is itself facing $75 million, and is expected to be funded around mid-December.
The studio's restructuring process began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to invest its finances as it could not afford to pay interest amounting to $300 million per year.
In August, chief executive Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron CEO and turnaround expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial woes and satisfy the studio's more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed at the end of 2009 to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the additional $2 billion that creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be redone as the MGM team began work on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially emerged from bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper received multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already secured $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which raised $375,000 a month for their company leadership services, will receive a $4 million "success bonus."
Barber and Birnbaum plan to restart production at MGM, which released only one film this year, and put together an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released starting in 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", with Warner Bros.
The studio must take out a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18 percent of MGM's debt, has tried to achieve a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech Toys to keep your gift budget in balance
While the leading contender for this year's most wonderful toy is the iPad, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make a significant dent in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic hop strings of beads, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers — Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, and BJ's Wholesale Club — to see electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It's clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's tech toy is likely to have more force; while costing the same if not a little less, compared to last year.
Also, while there are usually fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most well-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offerings.
And button cell toys are on the rise, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise stated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for ages 3 and up) are stuffed toys the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when you press them on their stomachs.
One pressure is equal to one note, and a second is used to compose a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Warning: once you start pressing, you can't stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for ages 2 and up) is the best choice.
Taking inspiration from last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll takes turns playing games like Simon Says and can do the moon dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel locks.
Children who have swept away the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It's back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for ages 3 and up), with a backpack filled with quiz cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with auto-correction and a valve binder.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three standalone alternatives.
VTech's Mobigo ($60, for ages 3-8) is the cheapest and easiest to use, along with a qwerty keyboard, although the games don't educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for ages 3-12), it's the first major revision of the Leapster lineup, with a newer, brighter display.
No version is compatible with older cartridges.
The Fisher-Price iXL ($90, ages 3-7) uses an iTunes-like system to offer games and e-books and has an SD card slot for displaying family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, ages 8 and up) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a matchbox, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks in line before time runs out, it's ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have some sort of online connection.
Based solely on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online from Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for ages 6-12) that includes a coin marked with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child receives enough Club Penguin store credits for two items to choose from.
It can be roller skates or a toy pet Uffle.
Slightly larger than the bristle at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for ages 5 and up) is the latest button battery micro robot.
The fake critter moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours withstood a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage in the mouth of our dog.
Bringing a softer side to policing in China
Tang Shenbin roamed a city square like an urban sergeant in training, severely inspecting his nervous loads, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan – imposing law enforcement officials in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and penchant for violence – to convey a certain impression to a set of spectators.
"Stand up straight!"
"Be piercing!"
Show them, he says, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely spent adolescence in white gloves, dressed in identical olive-colored jackets and pants, froze at attention.
Four pairs of black heeled shoes, lined up with the ruler.
Four neat hats perfectly perched on top of hair tied by a striped knot in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," Tang said, dismissively.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city required all new recruits to have an advanced degree.
Guangdong province has swapped the gray-green of uniforms for a supposedly more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the lower-the-eyes with the strong way: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by throwing black stares, firmly for half an hour, until the peddler packed up his belongings and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose to do a big image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its urban street police force with 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, shapeliness and young age.
The idea is to give the rougher police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have trouble drawing attention to China's underground urban brigade.
And for good reason, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce municipal ordinances by imposing fines or other administrative penalties.
But Chinese media portray the news as a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei province beat an observer to death after he used his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and posted online, described how to effectively defeat offenders without emitting blood.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon peddler was left with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game steeped in violence, available for download online, shows Chinese inspectors trained to assault street vendors.
"Chengguan has left its mark on the government," China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after yet another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for a "real complete clean-up."
Skeptics say the approach is a long way off.
After the district placed an ad in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News questioned whether the women had any real tasks or were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district's announcement required female candidates, aged between 18 and 22, to have a beautiful figure and "all five facial features in the correct order."
They must be above average in size of 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
Retirement at age 26 is compulsory.
Officers said the work was physically too strenuous for women over 25.
"It's their image that's important," a certain district officer told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine their suitability; It's about height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities."
The women of Chengguan are like flower vessels, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the city's district management office, does not subscribe to this description.
But he noted that height requirements are the standard in many Chinese job postings for both genders.
Such is the case with the requirement relating to the order of facial features.
Whether it means beautiful is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, people with disabilities or disfigurements should not apply.
"We can't let a limping person or a hunchback come and serve here," Zheng said.
"He wouldn't give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has cheeks with a finely curved mouth.
She doesn't consider highlighting her appearance to be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked disillusionedly.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old dimpled colleague, says: "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They are not opposed to their term being limited, they said, because they have greater career ambitions than simply chasing vendors into the alleys where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen street vendors who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many rolls or tofu bowls as possible before fleeing.
"Master Wang, you have to leave."
"We've already told you this many times!" said Ms. Xu as a vendor fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle cart bike.
Officers describe their duties as monotonous rather than arduous.
"It's pretty much the same every day," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies after-work marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate vendors' property.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after false rumors spread that chengguan agents had killed a vendor.
In one night, more than a dozen chengguan police and officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the placid Baoguang Square, where female officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle cried foul.
A 15-minute standoff ensued before the sinister-faced police elbowed their way to their vehicle and sped off with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, stayed behind, his white badge turned upside down to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 or over - play purely a supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Li said in a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it's the audience that starts."
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have dropped criminal charges against Sen. John Ensign stemming from a case related to a former campaign aide and his efforts to get lobbying work for the woman's husband, the senator's lawyers said Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible 2012 Republican presidential candidate until the scandal surrounding his case made national headlines last year and hurt his career.
Ensign's office said it was "very happy" with the decision, the result of a year-long investigation.
The senator could still be subject to disciplinary action by the Senate ethics committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer under investigation and did not intend to pursue any charges against him in this matter."
The Department of Justice declined to comment.
The announcement came as something of a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there was significant evidence that Mr. Ensign conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first reported in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his aides, secure lucrative lobbying work to gain the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then advocated for their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been an associate of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited by law for one year from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts argued that the unusual deal between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appears to contradict the so-called revolving door ban on lobbying.
Based on the evidence that has been made public, "there appears to be prima facie evidence of conspiracy to violate and material violation of the Revolving Door Law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients from a government investigation.
While the department's judge declined to explain the reasoning behind the Ensign decision, Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared wary of political prosecutions after a number of high-level setbacks by its public integrity section, including last year's decision to drop charges against former Sen. Ted Stevens accused of misconduct.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the executive director of citizens for accountability and ethics in Washington, a advocacy group that has received several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them", she added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's lead attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call Monday from a Justice Department prosecutor and a follow-up the next day, telling him the department was not seeking charges against his client.
Ensign's legal team had been working with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed Wednesday in a statement, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutor's office.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Justice Department except to say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Committee decided to drop an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada corporation that has long supported the senator, is one for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him he was "hammering" the Interior Department on an issue in dispute.
Ensign also attended a luncheon with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the transportation secretary to schedule a meeting on behalf of the airline after engaging Hampton to lobby.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth-largest Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for several months, Ensign said two weeks ago that he intends to run for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Department of Justice's lead and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing her hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were banging in the rows of the courtroom in the distance.
They sent reports of horrific testimony every minute via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said there were more than 140,000 messages about the rape trial and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of murdering three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to result in an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in court that outlines appeals that could occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial – as well as journalists' widespread and widespread use of Twitter – created a "circus atmosphere," a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with inflammatory details that the jury was misinfluenced by the passions of the audience.
The request could prompt appellate judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I experienced this in this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in courtrooms violates the human rights to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, attorney for Mr. Hayes, chief counsel.
Trial Judge Jon C. Bleue of the State Superior Court laconically dismissed the claims in last week's ruling, saying the media was "carefully controlled" and there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But this does not seem to be the last word on the matter.
Appellate courts have recognized for decades that media coverage of high-profile cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for murdering his wife, arguing in its ruling that there was a "carnival atmosphere at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the TV show and movie "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers have said that appellate courts called upon to review Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later may be curious given the argument that new rules may be needed to manage courtroom means of communication, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to be concerned about the impact of new media" in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue says some appellate judges may be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could allow for fairer trials.
The Twitter case is just one of many described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers that is likely to be discussed for years; which delays execution.
Defense attorneys also argue, for example, that Hayes would have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome photos of criminal scenes during jury selection.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical of prosecutors, and unduly pressured a verdict by making the unusual decision to have the jury deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors were not sequestered.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial might be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a challenge to the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and was being discussed during the campaign campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They maintained that the computer media kept fanning the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily stampede of tweets from media, cameras, and reporters outside the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "was unlike anything that has been seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even nationwide."
Their focus on Twitter system coverage is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that instant news was more inflammatory than slower releases was a Luddist view that would impoverish the court's policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said appellate courts are often drawn to arguments that social and technological changes require adaptation by the courts.
Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their file, they refer to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of media coverage of the trial and indicated that they would cite the need for new rules for new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century. "
Can civility bridge divides?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a modicum of civility erupted in Washington this week.
Is this a harbinger of true bipartisan forward cooperation or an illusory moment before the rapid return to partisan fighting in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no breakthrough on the big issues that need to be addressed during the "lame duck" session.
But clearly, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences of the two sides as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points. Empty scoring point partisan.
Wednesday's public meeting of the president's deficit committee was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain among members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect transcending the ideological divide; but which, nevertheless, still divides the members.
This is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two sides are now in a period of trial and mutual testing for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to gauge the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
That's why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent comments from participants revealed minimal demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxation, expenses, health care, or entitlements, the two sides stay miles apart.
Yet the November election moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There's no question that things have changed in tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official who now stands alongside the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
"It's inevitable after the elections.
Elections arouse partisan passions and then fade.
That's good."
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of that.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve part or all of it, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on extending unemployment benefits, if only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, while denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, there is more optimism about a possible agreement on the issues raised during the "lame duck" session, with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the lame duck session will not necessarily lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
"Once the things that need to be done are, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed widely shared skepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what happens between now and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present at the tea who helped create it.
But Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know they must try to live up to their promises to cut public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first reactions to the Deficit Committee's recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes, raising the retirement age and cutting spending.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, in their own view, imposed the deficit issue on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have struggled to reach that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the elected representatives of the group; This suggests that there is little reason or willingness to compromise on tax issues, at least today.
Galston foresees two phases in the fighting between the White House and congressional Republicans.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes and health care; and then followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
Public opinion.
There is ample evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully watch the public reaction.
Whoever is judged to be losing will have to change course and find compromises.
But it would nevertheless be an optimistic point of view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and congressional Republicans than there was then between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more substantial election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility on display this week might be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked US documents describe Moscow as a haven for corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a "kleptocracy" and is smuggling some of the bribes and protective money it collects to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia said in a February memo.
The police and the Federal Security Service carry out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized crime groups.
Every layer of the bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of power" – is doing its part as money moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The note is based on redacted sources.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and it is largely held accountable for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there has been little sign of cleaning up since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Baturina, who owns a leading construction company, have consistently denied accusations of corruption over the years; And he has won several defamation lawsuits on those charges.
In September, he told a Russian television station, when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's to be thrown away, it's nonsense."
Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt; according to surveys.
But it is unusual to find the information stated in an embassy report; And it is unheard of to conceive that it would be up to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link established between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it 'dysfunctional' and claim that the government functions more like a kleptocracy than a government," according to the embassy note.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term used in the criminal/mafia world that literally means 'roof' or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts identify a three-level structure in Moscow's criminal underworld."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, MVD and militias are on the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a void in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report states that the FSB handles the money of the largest companies and that the police target the small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow business owners understand that it is better to get protection from the MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law."
"This is why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer as high."
The note notes that, although the collection of money is extensive, the protection itself may be uneven; Even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their businesses closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption but has admitted that little progress has been made.
The embassy note transmits reports of men bringing suitcases, presumably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of Moscow's Indem think tank, said in a recent interview.
"But he's part of that bureaucracy."
"He is not part of a political class because there is none in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to INDEM, the costs of corruption amount to more than $300 billion a year across Russia.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The disclosure of the US embassy note, which was only carried out late yesterday evening, Moscow time, will certainly stir up discontent within the Russian government; although Luzhkov may be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow's failures, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin speculated that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fabrication and reacted angrily to the comments that US diplomats had leaked calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
"The problem lies in the fact that this is our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we didn't suspect it would be done with such arrogance, pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with decrepit concrete walls of poor quality, the principal of Anlong Veng Secondary School spoke of the man who built it, the last Khmer Rouge leader, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated stronghold of former Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former ISIS soldiers still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty to Anlong Veng is finally being challenged.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to face publicly those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook that, for the first time, teaches Khmer Rouge history to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly run with the United Nations, handed down its first sentence to a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch," to 35 years in prison.
As a result of these developments, anxiety has increased among Khmer Rouge veterans in Anlong Veng; complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation is generating divisions within families."
Under Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla warfare from their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a sequel to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had stood his ground, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 awaiting trial.
Without their benefactors, most former Khmer Rouge combatants have sunk into abject poverty, common to rural Cambodia; And many remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although some elite Khmer Rouge officers kept their positions as local leaders in exchange for laying down their arms, they are unskilled farmers with low rank and records.
"These people received very little follow-up after the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums across Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are imbued with the regime's utopian agrarian ideology."
"They were raised in an environment where doing business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Your Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to provide for ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge tribunal has also caused concern here.
The court is expected early next year to begin sentencing Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court's mandate is to try senior leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it has not said whether it is pursuing beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm Anlong Veng's fears.
The latest media speculation has turned to 64-year-old Im Chaem, a former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province under Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Documentation Centre of Cambodia that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced labourers were killed.
Recently, on a steamy evening, Im Chaem was returning from work in the field near his wooden house on stilts, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows over the parched grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court prosecuted several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confronting the past is all Cambodia needs to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang of the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation in Khmer terms is about reconnecting broken pieces," he says.
"We need to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The center produced the first government-approved manual on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, consisting of 75 pages."
He distributed it in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's history textbooks designed for higher education institutions, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the youth of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he came home with the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he says.
"They are suspicious because they don't know exactly how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are starting to have an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful atrait here.
In the heights of the Dangrek mountains, a path, overgrown with weeds and dotted with plastic bags, leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside mobile phone saleswoman, said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a great spirit; And many locals go there to pray, she says.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day she planned to walk to Pol Pot's final resting place where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas hoping to bring good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stockpile of weapons-grade uranium
The government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it would abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, an essential component for nuclear weapons; the move is part of a surprise victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials around the world.
The agreement was leaked in a joint statement issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research center.
That paved the way for an agreement Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the about 500-pound material, according to an official who raised the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Obama-initiated Nuclear Security Summit; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to provide an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit Nuclear Security Summit."
"This proves to me that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a nuclear security advocacy group.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" achieved by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world within the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries dispose of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially weapons-grade uranium and low-enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our product... We're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus moved closer to the United States a few months ago; however, by showing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, officials said.
The second operation was completed Monday and was carried out by plane, according to officials.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million on its efforts, largely to replace Belarus' research facilities with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"Careful coordination and organization have been implemented with a view to building confidence"; thus leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official specializing in Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates by the James Martin Center for the Study of Nonproliferation, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential revival.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains essential to improving bilateral relations; and indispensable to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government has raised no objections to the CIA flights
The government has raised no objections to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the US ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks to the daily El País, which add that the First Vice-President of the Government at that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed in order to "be able to demonstrate that they exercised adequate vigilance over foreign planes passing through Spain".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in practices contrary to human rights, a meeting took place between former US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "had caught Zapatero's Government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "caught off guard," Aguirre said in a cable.
The holder of the Ministry of External Affairs at that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity for influence".
In turn, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González conveyed to the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating elements, any sensitive information," the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States nevertheless showed its concern for the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the declassified information of CNI o of the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to maneuver the case quietly between governments," Aguirre said.
In March 2007 during a lunch between the U.S. Ambassador and the Minister of Internal Affairs, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented to him that "even though Spanish judges are madly jealous of his independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had instructed his aides "to avoid comments of fiery rhetoric.  trying to lower the temperature."
The ambassador also expresses his concern for the PP's action in this case.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the US Government,"  she says.
The parricide who confessed complained in a network of the "overwhelming" of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Galician terror"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used from childhood, communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; both from Noia, the village of La Coruña where she is from.
The messages date from 2008.
To hear them, you have to know your love life, which ABC builds with the help of the testimonies of his parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had initiated a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they separated, it was known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
Another new boyfriend was discovered shortly after that.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
With him, she lived together for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the job market, the little one stayed with his partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But according to the content of his communications, we hear that their romance has fractured, they have separated.
In March 2008 she was in Menorca, alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and upset for the fact that I came to work there."
"When I told him, it seemed like a good thing, but of course he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she talks about a mobile message she just received: "I want you to come home this month or you give me an address to send you the child."
Ella complains: "If he doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take it when I get home," she alleges.
In May, she talks about the return to her village: "This week I am leaving, but I will only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to go to a job so as not to lose it".
She explains that if all was well, she would have taken her eldest with her.
"He will stay with the correct person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him in my life with another person if that person is not my mother," dubious intention, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July, there is another post.
When she typed it, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived at the island on the 1st of that month, and had supposedly been murdered on the 10th, was dead.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but he is not happy on the other."
"On the one hand he is with me and he likes this place a little, but on the other hand he goes to school almost every day."
She talks about a trip to Mallorca.
"He will go there (the child) a few hours in the summer and so I save a little money from the babysitter."
On the 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when will you come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to the email, you see, when he wants, he finds me,."
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Víctor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me money".
On the Internet she has posts in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the now-blocked MySpace universe, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"Galician Terror (epigraph)".
The last man who lived with her, a security guard, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything had passed so that she hadn't told him that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered yesterday at the Provincial Penitentiary of Palma, from the Menorca Judicial Detention Centre.
The court-appointed lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she does not remember how the facts happened, "nor did she intend to harm the minor".
Before she had confessed to having drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his corpse in a suitcase.
The defence and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
The members of the People's Party would win 4 seats in the Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and deputies recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the general elections because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party obtains in these comices normally doubles that which it receives in the Catalan ones.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the general elections of 2008, while in the autonomics of 2006, they had obtained 316,222.
Last Sunday, the CPP received 384,091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend, desired of a diversion of votes of the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, the analysts of this formation have calculated the fact that, if there were general elections, the CPP could go from 8 to 12 deputies in the Congress, while CiU would also win four (it now has 10) and PSC would lose no more and no less than 9 deputies (it has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the people, ERC would lose one MP - it has three now - while ICV would keep one MP or gain one.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next appointment would take place in May 2011 for the municipal committees, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and popular people agree that PSC could lose the town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Gerona, where the Socialists would also not get a majority to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would not be fanciful for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona City Council - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its vote count in all four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they governed with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign they met several times.
The popular ones have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
At present, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in as many localities as possible.
Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerien detained by agents of the General Information Station of the Barcelona Police formed a jihadist cell which, led from Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaeda groups, including "Tigers for the Liberation of Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the latter being the perpetrator of the Mumbai attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internals has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" has "been debilitated" the apparatus of falsification of Al Qaeda at the international level and "consequently, its operational capacity".
Investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then distributed to groups that integrated the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its "fighters" could cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network held operational in Europe, which is why in the investigations participated, apart from Thai services, other European police units, which is why in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days blows similar to the one recorded last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerien Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), another was held in Thailand, with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were the ones who ran the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole from tourists passports that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be in the name of young men aged between 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The investigators point out that so far no details have been found that connects detainees in Catalonia with the Mumbai attack, even though the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless we must remember the fact that a few days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia a few thousand dollars were sent through a transfer agency that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used later by the members of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police seized on an abundant documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally explain to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as President of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and which boil down to giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignist adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to address halfway through his mandate.
The president of the Catalan people arrived at the appointment with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition abstains in the vote of the investiture.
On a possible agreement with the PP depend the future alliances that the nationalists wish to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are taking place in Catalan key.
And as for the president of the PP, to support an investiture "it would be necessary to eliminate all sovereignist and separatist speeches", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wants to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bet to slim down the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomic administration and the elimination of the tax applied to inheritances and gifts.
Details of the negotiations on Mas's investiture will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
Geriatric says the deaths were not due to 'lack of measures'
Olot center owners don't rule out possibility their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The heads of the geriatric La Caritat of Olot (Girona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible in the meantime he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the center's lawyer, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the responsible" for the dead, but "legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civilian officials".
And apart from the social discrediting that the entity may suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a large compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' relatives are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that from that day on he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric - because he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures can not have been at any time the cause of what happened".
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in this case there is only an indication of recklessness on the part of any other person than the accused".
The person already baptized as the "Angel of Death" confessed the day before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused her death by injecting her with a sober dose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative lozenges.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control the access of the centre's staff to medicine.
Insulin injections and the cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to relieve the suffering of the interns, used to kill them.
But laboratory tests will clarify whether Vila is not lying by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside giving them laundry as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed in the interval 12 - 17 October.
Caritas does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of confessed murders, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number being greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way of killing after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
Peripheral differentials closed with strength and European bank shares suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should also not underestimate the ECB's ability to get it wrong and the euro has barely recorded an increment, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way that it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by close short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose fear.
A month ago, ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
Bundesbank demanded the finalization of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the long term and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, let us hope that the current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and that the quarterly auction with unlimited access will be maintained at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We hope that the bond-buying programme will continue and that we will even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not fulfill the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, may God help us!
Just as they said they had not even considered buying bonds and collapsed the markets, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
ECB must be believable and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and on Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the auction of one-year drafts in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million at 5.28% compared to 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the guys in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a shift in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland the figures for the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland have been published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potential and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Even if Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are bearable in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval for its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a hotbed of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest Beethoven's hymn of joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity yesterday to present the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment ring to investors' hears like Vivaldi's four seasons.
The double Trichet and ZP effect explains the fact that the Spanish stock exchange suffered 4.5%, double that of the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was swift and radical, and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will resolve itself with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for an Assistance Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in liquidity available, triple compared to March, to very expensive types and they cut off access to markets indefinitely.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "apart from being, seeming".
Courage, we can get by!
The president of Eulen will challenge the advice of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will contest, because he considers it "null and void", the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, solicited by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of the firm titular Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for control of a share of the group.
The founder of the larger holding company for business services for companies does not seem to be willing to give in in his dispute to be present on the management bodies of El Enebro.
He was excluded from his board of directors by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors at the shareholders' meeting of January 18 this year, the contestation of which is registered in the Trade and Companies Register.
The Judicial Council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, has once again opened the box of thunders within the Álvarez family.
Recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate appeal by the plaintiffs of his five sons to try, through a procedural quibble, clearly defrauding the law and abusing the law, to validate and correct the radically null assembly on January 18," according to its official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for that, once the meeting takes place, it is contested by considering that it is "null and void".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully to have the magistrate convene an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a patrimonial company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group nevertheless seeks usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the application for contestation for which there is not yet a date indicated.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with secret weapon from Siemens
Software creates improvements on cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select world of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of recent seasons, the past November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the triumph of Ferrari Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering the ability as a driver of the champion, the German Sebastien Vette, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives far removed from high motorist competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to create assembly lines for manufacturing plants around the world, energy stations, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 teams had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on the vehicles each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyse and project all kinds of modifications to the cars.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull's cars except the engine, which is the exclusive responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features are modified.
Changes can go from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced high-tech laser and autoclave production systems.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological improvement is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to create and produce its cars in a locality 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret".
The staff for this duty is 580 people, including two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's Formula 1 hero, arguably, is recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and whose notoriety is zero.
The plant's chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be argued that R+D advances in the case of race cars brought 50% of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology accounts for 85% of success, while pilots provide 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computers, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 own stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the network of 20 stores between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will count this initiative with the 16 zones already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the redesigned store located on Barcelona's Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been working for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to set up 200 branded points of sale in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first opened were those in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero wouldn't reveal the next possible stores, though she admitted Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM Personal Systems assured that the philosophy for the establishment of the stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and takes care of the exclusive furniture of the stores (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of institutional staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and pointed out that the exclusive network of shops claims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchasing, support, post-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering pilot program on a global level that solves possible problems with HP computer equipment under warranty.
An online service connects with a technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is designed especially for MSEs and users, because large companies have already contracted technical support services," Helena Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'stealing' one million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse in interest margins, which will be partially offset by increments in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million private customers, its task to accomplish.
Sabadell has found a path to exploit for the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new master plan in 2011 with a three-year term.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need to resort to FROB's public subsidies, is to gain a market rating by capturing a million new individual customers - 700,000 if we deduct those who can leave the bank - its great task to accomplish, because until now this bank had spoiled SMEs and companies more than the individual customer.
This year it attracted 250,000 individual customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market rating for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the bet on productivity, or what is the same thing, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its Optima master plan, established four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for one more year.
Customers who let savings banks slip out will be his main goal.
During a breakfast hosted by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the liability war – which penalizes margins – is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and credit unions pay for its issuance to obtain liquidity are already shifting to the price of credit to compensate for falling margins.
"The liquidity and funding aspect is structural and will be a pressure on credit."
"We haven't tightened the tap, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola admitted.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November-.
He also admitted that the trend in the banking sector now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth although, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "we will solicit larger dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he said.
He claims that capital requirements "increase enormously" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentions that the FROB can replace the market in the capture of funds in the case of new recapitalizations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the time close of the markets, he diminished the importance of the fact that some banks are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that you can't issue, but unlike what happened in June, you can get short-term funding through rest, which alleviates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the caisses
The Director-General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of savings bank mergers and stressed again the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the merger process of the Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that assured that they were not going to participate in this first phase and that they reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CESC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of the mergers have been carried out, we cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most of it was done completely; it is possible that instead of 17 we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation too," said the leader.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Leaders and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration is being carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is carried out within the deadlines that have been set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain",  he emphatized.
"The move from 45 funds with an average of 28,500 million in asset volume to 17 with 75,500 million is a trial without parallel in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to be Basel compliant," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of rather unhappy opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of serosity and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain is doing is reminding us that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
The director general of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world and he attributed to those who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has begun a process of concentration "very important" and "is going at the greatest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector has done well from the stress tests that ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin opted to stay in the euro, but it set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions provoked a doble government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new adjustment methods, which vary from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private employment agencies or abolition of the 426 euros of aid to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of the 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and the 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins Chancellor Angela Merkel's criticism of her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the currency zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, even if now it seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, nearly 50% of the population.
The third, a new conception of the euro, in line with German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payments by one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought should be done (fiscal austerity plans and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including the France, were practicing.
The second blow of the Central European country was when Merkel hardly prolonged the decision to save Greece.
From that moment it was fiercely criticized, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the published were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union's treaties to make it possible to rescue a country and at the same time force private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although somewhat watered down, was approved and, in the following months, we should see the process of reforming the Union that makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think it will cross.
And it tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not be too much in agreement, from that date on the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new currency area, in which countries that break the rules will be severely punished, they can be forced to declare themselves in default and, in this case, the private sector will also bear part of the costs.
Germany warns us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge balance-of-payments holes, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The stakes are clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just a question of renewing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What is being asked of us is much harder.
And what he absolutely must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence allows us to achieve greater tranquility.
And that we know how to seize the opportunity we have been given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard it in this form and his double declaration (the reforms promised after the last Saturday's meeting with big business and yesterday's announcement of the new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticism, the way has been opened to the thesis that the house must be put in order.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to be moving it.
And among the possibilities that are envisaged, we cannot exclude that of abandoning a monetary zone too full of unserious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sport and Fraud of the Law
The tricks similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the will to escape punishment.
The expulsion plotted in principle by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has caused a lot of ink to flow on the unsporting nature of such behavior and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is known, a few minutes before finishing the match (which their team was already clearly winning), both players deliberately wasted time when they committed fouls to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will end up being leaders of their group, both players will carry out the regulatory sanction during the next match of the play-off match against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee sanctioned the team's coach, Jose Mourinho, with two games and different economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, if not rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, the unwritten, but followed, rules of this sport.
Part of the debate that has arisen in this case is due to the fact that this had as protagonist a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem displays nobility and honor and which on past occasions has fined its players for similar acts) and to the orchestrated dramatization,  it seems, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his dilated story of a histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour not expressly prohibited by the rules contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions are committing a fraud of the law; Because, indeed, they are respectful actions with the sporting regulations, but seem to evade its meaning.
The question is to look at the kind of harm they cause to sportsmanship.
One of the goods that includes sportsmanship is the physical integrity of opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been endangered, that is, there has been no violent play.
Another of these goods alluded to with the correct game is to prevent the team of infringer players from taking unfair advantage of the opposite team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not accommodate what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not carried out secretly to try to avoid the sanction, but their action precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty of the referee.
They were waiting and they gladly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of benefit that offenders gain from the intentional misconduct examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and one does not obtain an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action supposes the fact of leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club wouldn't be able to rely on those players.
Obviously the advantage is that the players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action the players perform a penalty match and move on to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So that, climbing the ladder, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to sportsmanship, which includes strategic decision-making that maximizes the benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not take action to avoid the application of the sanction (this would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law), but otherwise they chose instead the moment in which they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without thwarting the penalty or running away from it.
Even if the line between genius and fraud of the law is diffuse, on this occasion I think we had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises because of two factors: because there were two self-expulsions and because of the way in which the director was transmitted to provoke them.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the turret and the lottery, when December arrives also come the group dinners before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but which because of the crisis have led to an offensive adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals,  The businessmen and industry associations interviewed coincide.
To complete the complication of the accounting, this year's calendar (as New Year's Eve falls on Friday) concentrated requests in the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner bookings for peak days (17 and 17) and almost nothing the week before.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying out of their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all ask for battle prices, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employer, now, does not dare to predict how the holidays will be this month.
"People think a lot before booking."
"They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to prices," he said.
The deal will go well "for those who give quality at a good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the tranche around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
In a survey in various establishments of the center we note the collapse of applications for the night of the 17th.
The Soteras group indicates that there is a real boom in requests for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar meant more early bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices as last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, remains optimistic after detecting a surge in billing since the second half of the year and good, albeit concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend a 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as Catalan wine made according to the champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies inviting their employees again and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
On behalf of the Fecasarm employers (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, confides in the possibility of starting to see the final of the tunnel and maintains that overall bookings are "lively", even if customers "negotiate to the maximum".
This is true, hope for the festivities has not diminished, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear program is causing great concern in the United States
Islamabad is producing atomic weapons at "a faster rate than any other country."
Wikileaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concern caused in Washington by the Pakistani nuclear programme.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details offered about the content of the conversations and thoughts of the US diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, is "decreasing" and that the volatile Asian country is producing nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program – the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored in components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack – is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
Thus, the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report before the visit of former National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose noise runs and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is viewed, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a proliferation and a reason to maintain the guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of External Affairs during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The news of the documentation filtered through Julian Assange's portal is the ever-shrinking cooperation between the US and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and Pakistan's high degree of nuclear arma production.
An embassy dispatch in May, which described communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", argued: "Transparency is frequently non-existent; offers of help remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence official for South Asia, noted that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistan Army must end with tacit support for terrorist groups."
Hunting for the head of Wikileaks
Obama will number a senior counterterrorism official to prevent further infiltrations.
Interpol issues a red alert to track movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, this one is not new, otherwise it dates from November 20.
And this one has nothing to do with the latest filtration of more than a quarter million diplomatic documents from the United States but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer and creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
On the 20th the international police force based in Lyon (France) dictated the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, all 188 Interpol countries were instructed to identify or locate Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition."
Even if Interpol cannot issue an order for the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization, consider the red notice call a clear avenue for arrest - which the national police force must carry out - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England.  where Assange is believed to be.
The move outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder has shown himself willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities via video conference.
They also recall that Assange applied for and obtained the permit to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, who is compared to the notorious Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's security chief.
"This appears to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," the letter said.
While the world searches for him – and in Australia his mother defends her son's innocence – Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday he gave an interview to the editor of Time magazine through Skype at an undetermined location, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that she was responsible for giving orders to the American graduates they spy on at the UN by violating the international treaties that the United States signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not at all sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us," he told CNN.
Obama himself tasked a senior counterterrorism official, Rusell Travers, with preventing further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's spokesman's attempt to downplay Assange's importance contrasts with the views conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Peter King, the congressman who from January will chair the National Security Committee in the lower house, has asked the State Department to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance".
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to retract his statements after saying Assange should "be assassinated."
"Obama should turn it into a target and wear out an unmanned aircraft or something similar."
One person who did not ask for an apology was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever is in the Government that leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution would be too kind a punishment," he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with nods to Carod followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to resolve the umpteenth internal revolt inside ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware of the fact that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that this can absolutely not give him headaches that he had with other extinct currents.
This is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new critics with winks that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
For starters, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 ERC national councillors will be able to vote on its continuity in secret.
By ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the carodists want to convey a certain vote of penalization to the president, they will be able to do so without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he said that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "Bulgarian-style" would not be good either.
People close to Carod demanded that the president do little more than make his position available to the militancy, a gesture that was not worth when Puigcercós controlled the maxim body between congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap until May.
For this, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the vote of the national council on the 18th.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the latter's promise to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider a sure fact.
The ERC leader admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that his goal is to ensure that once and for all the organization is able to wash its laundry room with its family.
In this line, the article that the current councillor Josep Huguet signed in his blog results symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five, of which he highlights two.
The first, "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is to say, include new figures who come from the sector adept of Carod.
The second may be the character of big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidates once and for all the assembly as an operating mechanism.
Thus, he defends a reform of the statutes that allows the realization of congresses through delegates elected by vote.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of Puigcercós' team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulse conclave of 2008 instructed the leadership to revise the assembly model in a specific congress of reform of the statutes.
This meeting remains incomplete, because the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this subject.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, now might be a good time to resume and shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the state of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month, according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.

A day later in Nezahualcóyotl a 50-year-old gentleman was murdered with eight shots as he left his house to initiate garbage collection work.
On the seventh of November, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by a gunshot to the head each in the colony of San Pedro Xaloxtoc, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the grace shot in the forehead, the body of a man was found on a lonely path in Colonia El Naranjo and under the body was found a bullet hit by a .25-caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina settlement.
The emergency bodies conducted an exhaustive search for the rest of the body limbs, but they were not found.
Residents of Tepotzotlán alerted to the discovery of a corpse that was in Peña Colorada, hands tied behind and blindfolded.
The man had a gunshot wound to the neck.
In the middle of the month, two men were reported to have been executed and left in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the Atizapán municipality of Zaragoza, and two death warning messages were discovered at the same time with the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the settlement of Valle de los Reyes, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the hamlet Zoquiapan of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning the corpse of a man in Huixquilucan who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, agreed with a message that his executors had left beside him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshot wounds to the neck, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman's skin were detected tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with her image.
Towards the end of the month, the body of a man was found in the vicinity of a man in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet holes and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads wrapped and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said: "This is what happens with those who do not align".
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with their hands and feet tied, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Centre of the San Agustín colony.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next to it; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, agents found a Bristol with a message.
China maintains greenhouse gas reduction targets
The representative of this country in COP16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and detailed that it maintains its offer to reduce until 2020 between 40 and 45 percent its greenhouse gas emissions.
China stands by its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and reconvert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years, his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China will not change its goals, but it will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including the approval last year of a new Energy Law, which recognizes the objectives addressed with regard to the reduction of greenhouse gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with government and local authorities to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans underway or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned, the Energy Efficiency Program, which has been implemented for the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of incandescent lamps with energy-saving lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country's government's scientific adviser on climate change, said China's efforts have been greater than anyone thinks.
For example, he explained, China's per capita greenhouse gas emissions are three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution in contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase a 20% energy efficiency in the last five years and plans to make another similar one around 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN detailed that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
In the interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonoran Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, if necessary, by making a complaint to the Order Commission of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance for the presidential candidacy on the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections next 4 and 5 December where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for now, it has been an approach to local elections that has been successful and achieved its goal," he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; On the contrary, "we savor it and make ourselves stronger," he said.
He said that no doubt the board will be able to elegate the best leader Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so it would give the succession "to the person determined by the council."
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the office of party president to any of the five."
He predicted that the recovery recorded by the party in the past elections of July 4 will be reflected on the next dispute, even if "it is not yet the time to think about 2012."
"For the moment it is a question of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that there have been "many hopes for them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years in government, César Nava asked the priistes to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas were better than those of Fox y Calderón; that they begin to defend them; Let them come out of the 'cupboard,'" he said.
He said that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Audience, because in the country there is no gag order, let alone censorship.
Obama tweets law for undocumented students
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," the US president tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Obama tweeted.
His short message keeps open a cyber link to a larger document that asks the public to contact senators immediately as the vote on legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that we hope soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was leaked after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the passage of any legislation if the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding continues.
Such a blockage, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the passage of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the New START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockage of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax problem is resolved we can fix an arrangement for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be solved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at some point to that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would call for a "closing debate" vote on the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on starting next Thursday in the Senate, although the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act would legalize 800,000 young people who came to the United States before the age of 16, stayed in this country for the past five years and were accepted by an institution of higher learning or the military.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the support of a large number of Republicans, at times when the project's partisan organizations are lobbying intensively to ensure the approval of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican expressed support for the bill, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That's why supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most sought-after Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and incumbent Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed Senator Mel Martínez's term.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they have said they will not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his posture so far.
Even though the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles of the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature we put our finger on the wound
The second stage of the Pleasures of Language was a walk in which participants displayed the narrative
"Sex in language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what do they expect from me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of Language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and this time used the subtitle of her question (during another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the wound"... embarrasses us," the Argentine writer gently told the audience, most of them young people, who had gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined afterwards as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "wound" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: "patience is not my forte, it may be my wound".
At the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who took his breath away in the middle of the hallway, but who explains that wound is not a scientific term; It is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "The wound is what is open in reality, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded: "on the wound I could only know that it is that is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced of the fact that the pleasures and pitfalls of the language must be very intertwined.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a delightful narrative entitled In Praise of Invention, where the finger on the wound is not counted but at some point is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he speaks of a famous bewitcher who touched clouds, made people who had gone far or repaired virtues that a damsel had lost, a narrative that turns to speak then America, the great news that had from the beginning its own chroniclers and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of the narratives of the conquering captains.
"Cervantes, who invented all of us (writers), mocked the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a different way one would never have told the history of America with an imagination that lacked even modesty."
Nevertheless, he stressed, "madmen and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with lies, we no longer know how much of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
This is called the 'Cervantes tradition'.
"It is thanks to his legacy that we are what we tell."
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the invitation of the FIL with her round table The Must on the Wound.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican has put hers on the great plague of social violence that her country is going through - and Latin America shares - produces disputes over drug trafficking and sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs contain a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated," she said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also stressed "it must on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in high speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind every statement there is a small no and behind every negation there is a small yes".
"To be the masters of our own feelings and be the masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times to put the finger on the wound and disturb people who feel very convenient thinking in caricature, in white and black, in established ideas and without nuance and also disturb the powers that prefer a world in white and black",  he said, inviting us to recover the meaning of writing.
Romano in the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in finals he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has reached the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find between them a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has been able to reach the decisive series three times, even if so far he has not put in the mile and that's why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentinian ended up consoling himself with the sub-champion medal, he stayed one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Santist strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held the reins of Morelia with whom he lost with an overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the Closing 2003 he also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and it was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the Bicentennial Tournament 2010, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered again a setback, as his team made a match tied 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed from 11 meters and he suffered the jumped to 4-3.
Rubén has lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, so he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to detach himself from the curse to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even if he says that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," said the helmsman when asked what his weaknesses would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot the last final, from which he assures that he learned a lot, "the only lesson we can learn is that until the referee whistles the final, we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to run and I believe that is a lesson,  Before the end of the game we can't celebrate."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he confides in his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to finish within the regular deadline, but sometimes we just have to prepare, the previous tournament we were prepared,  Unfortunately fate has taken a bad turn on us, sometimes it is the emotions or the anguish of holding the title in our hands, hands it escaped us, it served us as a lesson for this final and we hope that we do not arrive in this situation again".
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining the visa
Individuals should go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers prior to their interview in the Consular Section; The cost The waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011 the visa processing procedure at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to report to the Visa Applicant Service Centres (CSAs) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have some advantages for aspirants, among which the following are mentioned:
The total cost to process the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to get an appointment, another payment for visa processing and another for the courier service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a one-time payment that will cover all three services.
The current fee will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (this includes visas for temporary workers) and $390 for merchant and investor visas.
Persons who wish to renew their visa will not have to attend an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only go to the nearest CSA where they will present the documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken from the CSA, applicants who wish a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will stay there for less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the $26 service surcharge.

NASA to announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The US space agency has quoted the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When it quoted the press, NASA assured that it would present who will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which has sparked speculation from experts in other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if its living conditions are improved.
There seems to be talk of a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought to be too venomous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any form, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our volunteer atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will communicate the true significance of the findings in tomorrow's press conference, Thursday.
The conference will feature geobiology by Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest satellite), from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón 'bloc' opposing
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, we make possible the arrival of "bipartisanship", it is denounced.
The 60th had just taken hold when in the Congress appeared an opposing bloc led by the deputies of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared themselves independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of the "two-party system" in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, de PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, de PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'thundered' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, we initiate the "bipartisanship" because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four deputies, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Executive Board chaired by PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that with these institutional reforms we constitute political marginality on the part of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that in the following days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme starting from a political will and if they do not have it, they will again be enslaved by both parties and in this way will finish the opposing coalition.
"So far (the opposing coalition) has arrived, that's what I'm looking at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia, mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, for Congress, after being monopolistic, to now be "duopolistic."
"It is not the spirit of law reform that there should be an eternal bipartisanship in Congress."
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues so that they are more numerous, abounded the Convergent.
PT's Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza explained that now the Congress has turned into a 'spoils' in between, referring to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the deputy, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they do not leave by cupular agreements out to 5 who will probably be 9 deputies, now to the five that we see, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unite to seek a place in the negotiating table, this is the problem, that in the reform they have made, that they have decided,  We are out and we do not agree with this reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The City Council of Mazatlán pays another cheque to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another cheque of about 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With it, the amount paid this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last cheque number 9258447 was issued on November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in concept of "liquidation of accounts payable".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Municipality would pay other amounts to this supplier, who was observed by the Superior Audit of the State to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many checks will still be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and the latter, November 16.
Even if the supplier has not yet published in the Official Gazette of the State, according to the provisions of the Law when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after July 25, Noroeste had published a revision of the checks that the City Council issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the interval March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also transacted with Jumapam, cashing checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Sights need to be cared for
Tourism entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the poor conditions of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatlán.
After a foreign tourist fell in a hollow in the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, Mazatlán's tourism sector asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of Zona Dorada, recalled that they have several times asked that the image of the destination be cared for and and new activities must replace others that tourists find bad.
He said the poor condition of streets and sidewalks has affected as tourists come to walk there and they see the mess and avoid nearby businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it means to close a business one day and they don't know the fortune you lose, elsewhere they didn't do the work for so long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and avoid that it happens again, how to do it, so through preventive maintenance and only do the correction," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because of the fact that it is a tourist area should we maintain it, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to maintain the city well".
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it does not depend only on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They have not been given the attention they need and these types of facts highlight something that is notorious to all, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of Mazatlán's tourist sites is urgent, as they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be put in line together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and that it is attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlán offers a lot of historical and cultural sites and places that we should order first, clean up and put online to make them attractive to be able to add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP demands results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CCE, proposed that deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations that confront it.
The business sector of Mazatlán is asking for a dignified working legislature free of agreements between the parties and the Government Executive, because Sinaloa is convulsed and faces great problems.
Yesterday the 60th legislature was installed formed by seven political forces, 19 deputies of PRI, 13 of PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM, in total 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress is a clean and committed management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of partisanship or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CCE, proposed that deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations that confront it.
"We hope that MPs really exercise their right, free of agreements between parties because the custom is that they make pacts to look after their own interests and they turn into a carnival masquerade of the rulers and leaders of parliamentary fractions."
That is why I ask them to certify the commitment to build the necessary bridges that the current Government is making progress.
"We will ensure that they do a dignified and above all committed job with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Tres Islas Hotels, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is that of pushing and adding forces in seeking the economic growth of the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that in a way that will stimulate the generation of jobs."
Regarding the tourism activity, he asked that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understood that it is the second Secretariat of State with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as an important economic activity and generator of foreign exchange and investment and that competes directly with agribusiness."
Apart from the fact that it is necessary to classify resources to detonating tourism projects that help to give security to the State and update the Law of Alcohol that previous legislatures have not been able to solve.
We are looking for king mage
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Three Kings will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is formed by no more and no less than 12 people and a kid.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live hand-to-mouth because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebs' to sell in the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3, wants a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a monster truck and for his 8-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests size clothes for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like to have this monster', but I told him 'we'll see, my son', because he was very expensive," Cayetana recalls sadly.
For older children, who was at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11, wears size 12; Isaías, 10, wears size 10, while Miguel, 8, wears size eight.
Jose Juan, 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of sizes five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can participate in the We Seek Magus King campaign, donating a toy or money to the Noroeste reception.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places allegedly used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used for production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Sûreté du Québec.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Those arrested were to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
The raids followed a lengthy investigation that lasted nearly a year.
"It was information received from the public that allowed us to make these arrests," Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the Estrie regional investigation module of the Sûreté du Québec, the Service de police de Sherbrooke and the Régie de police Memphrémagog took part in this police operation.
Irregular migration can continue without problems
The Conservatives' bill, which the government says should solve the problem of boats loaded with illegal migrants, will obviously be defeated while the three opposition parties indicated Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I'm standing with a party that created granite under your feet," Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff said as he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the bill as proposed, which would allow anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants to be detained for up to a year, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, has also indicated that he cannot support the bill because he is attacking the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government does," Duceppe said.
NDP immigration critic Olivia Chow dismissed criticism that her party is not tough enough on illegal immigrants.
"New Democrats agree that we should take action against human smugglers and that is what we are doing through another bill, Bill C-35," Chow said.
"We don't support the Conservatives' bill because it preys on refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians are telling MPs overwhelmingly that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a doormat."
"They expect Canada to take strong action," Kenney said.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led to an election if it was rejected.
However, a Conservative told QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that each MP who opposes will then explain himself to his constituents.
The new unit is not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, maintains that this idea is not new: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation of New York on this subject as early as last January.
The metropolis has had a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
Still, Tuesday's announcement came as a surprise to many.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Police Services in Quebec on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was enough for the PQ critic in public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to describe this announcement as "rabbit out of a hat" and "solution cobbled together on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You're going to see the result when we announce it," he said.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr. Charest persists in not wanting to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To break this deadlock, he suggested that Quebec City give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the auditor general," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government's plans.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in this type of investigation.
Federal Public Safety Minister Vic Toews confirmed that his Justice colleague Rob Nicholson is currently considering some amendments related to the issue.
During Operation Spring 2001, which hit motorcycle groups, although the Criminal Code was not adequate, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under close surveillance
Several rivers remain under close surveillance due to the heavy rainfall that has hit several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
Two houses were evacuated as a preventive measure.
In the evening, another slippage would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, with 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters of rain was expected by Thursday evening, depending on the region.
Areas north of the river and in the Ottawa Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
Since this precipitation must be added to the melting of snow already accumulated in some areas, there is concern that several rivers will overflow.
Flood warning warnings were issued Wednesday night by the Civil Security of Quebec for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers, in Lanaudière.
The North River, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and the Oak River, in Lotbinière, were subject to flood watches and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy precipitation caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was washed away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In the Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on alert and is monitoring the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, Security Advisor.
The Quebec Flood Prediction Centre issued heavy flood warnings Wednesday for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and du Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec City radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) for controversial comments about social assistance and Haitians as well as his coarse language on air.
The CBSC found that Mr. Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that some of the comments contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative portrayals of Haitians and coarse language that is inappropriate for programs broadcast during the day."
The Commission also found that a discussion of suicide, including the broadcast of the names of two individuals who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CBSC had received several complaints about comments made during programs broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was rendered following a complaint by the Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the program were inaccurate.
Facilitators must present solid rather than misleading information.
Regarding suicide, the host Stéphane Dupont had estimated that suicide is a cowardly gesture.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the implicated episodes of 'Dupont le midi' addressed a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
No blame was therefore placed on him.
The last dispute concerned statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort then engaged in a media face-to-face that provoked a lot of reactions.
The CHOI host said he didn't make any donations to help Haitians because it couldn't be known for sure that needy people would actually receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative portrayal of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension on this."
"My file has been blank for a year and a half," the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of foul language.
In each case, broadcaster CHOI-FM cooperated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during prime time within three days.
A king of kung fu in Montreal
Algerian-born Montrealer Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special background.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing gets on the tatami mats and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts such as kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," said Zemmal, who has been living in the city since 2008 to play professionally.
"In my case, I look for fights everywhere, because for those who do not like the ground game present in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the man who works as a security guard and clerk for UPS delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Amateur Championship, October 23-30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories," he explained.
"Right now, I'm preparing to go to China for the World Cup in San Shou."
"The fighters who finished in the top four at the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007 in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, while I came third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"What's interesting is that I've progressed with each competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
"San shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where punches and kicks, as well as throws to the ground, are allowed.
Duels are originally held on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most renowned pugilist to come out of this form of fighting is Vietnamese-American Cung Le, who is well known in the martial arts world.
If Nacer Zemmal has to remember only one event in his career, he will certainly answer his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," explained the friendly guy.
"It's kind of the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real pro," he said.
"There are four fighters per category (80kg, 85kg, 90kg and 90kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals compete in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face each other to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without calls for tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded $450 million in contracts to engineering firms by mutual agreement for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium made up of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor was awarded the largest contract, the project management consortium, for $295 million without a call for tenders.
This consortium, called Énergie gérance, was formed in 2004 at the same time as Hydro-Québec decided to entrust the private sector with its responsibility for managing this major $5-billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Energy Management consortium won the lucrative contract without a public call for tenders.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of consortia of companies poses a serious ethical problem that could eliminate competition and cause prices to rise.
"This is the new way of colluding and taking down the competition."
"That is to say, people, instead of doing this secretly, now do it openly," PQ MP Sylvain Simard said yesterday at a press conference.
Earlier this morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said he found it difficult to see how the public interest can be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, vigorously denying that there was collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my trip," she said, arguing that the PQ had been "dishonest" and had "lacked rigour."
She said that "it would be the least we could do" for the PQ to apologize.
The consortia formula is a common practice worldwide.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scope of the work.
Work is underway and is scheduled to run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition; There was negotiation.
Also, the consortia formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula of consortia in the consulting engineering sector is the subject of an investigation by the government.
A quick overview of the Québec enterprise register reveals more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, comes down to one and the same legal person, Dessau.
As for the Energy Stewardship consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay territory responds to specific workforce dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been responding in a particular way since the 70s".
The big boss of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), gave an explanation that raised eyebrows on the fact that the project management contract was awarded by mutual agreement.
"If you go to tender and there are few bidders, your prices are going to be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in that market and say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that it's not the price that's important, it's the skill of the people," Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts over $50,000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After audit, Le Devoir counted 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin won 22 contracts, Génivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not to mention its participation in Énergie gérance.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the contract with Energy Stewardship for $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Quebec Liberal Party".
Minister Normandeau dropped that the PQ is also linked to these firms that "finance" it, before specifying that it was rather its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
Quebec consumers have very little confidence in sustainable development players, but also in fair trade brands and green certifications to guide their choices.
Worse, even if he is immersed in a media universe where messages in favor of more responsible consumption abound, he deplores a lack of credible information, a deficiency that he even describes as a brake on his commitment, says the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even though they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of Responsible Consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another observation: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications affixed to so-called fair trade products, but also the credibility of products and brands claiming to be eco-responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, politicians' discourse on this theme is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this part of consumption, which is currently driven by nearly one-third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and dubious nature of the information would calm the ardour of 46% of consumers.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers also say they are suspicious of the alleged performance of green products or services that are sought to put in their hands.
On another note, in 2010 consumers were nearly half to have changed their habit and especially changed the brand of one or more products to meet their conviction.
At 61%, they also favored purchases from merchants in their neighborhood and favored the purchase of food products grown in their region, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about animal protection.
But his social and ecological conscience seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers said they had used public transit or advocated carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this vast behavioral survey, which has just taken its first shot.
A loan from the State for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which was asked to make a financial commitment to the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by Société Angus and Le Parallèle, agreed to collaborate, but only up to one loan.
The Société de développement Angus et le Parallèle, which had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinema complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard by restoring it to its full cinephilic vocation, did not get what they demanded.
The government agreed to get involved in the file, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Quebec government is proposing a loan whose amount would be lower than initial expectations, which could be a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of sources from government offices.
A first action plan and a request for $12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who is leading the eXcentris file.
He sent her a final report about ten days ago.
But the cabinet's counter-proposal reached SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
It seems, however, that the hypothesis of the gift of the State really must be rejected.
Recall that the Association des propriétaires de cinémas et de cinéparcs du Québec opposed a direct investment by the state to support the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it has not done for other movie theaters.
On the contrary, several stakeholders in the field called for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of céans, carried auteur cinema at arm's length in his premises of the complex after having financed its construction himself, which could justify a derogation on the part of the Treasury Board.
The lack of theaters for independent films is glaring in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to retain its clientele.
Société Angus and Le Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, are piloting a private fundraising campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the acquisition wheel.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, continues to broadcast films on eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three cinemas on February 27 by screening Xavier Beauvois' beautiful film Des hommes et des dieux.
But Christian Yaccarini has not recalled Le Devoir and it is unclear what he and his group think of the downward proposals made to them.
The veil lifted on a complexed Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables leaked by WikiLeaks unveil what the U.S. sees as Canadians' inferiority complex toward Americans, but at the same time betray Americans' sense of superiority toward Canada.
For example, U.S. diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter does not have Canada-U.S. relations in mind when they go to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government pass its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were on the public floor yesterday, offer more crunchy details than substantial content to chew on.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the middle of the federal election campaign, tells how the United States is not among the issues discussed by political leaders.
Much to the astonishment of the U.S. ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
"An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may condition Canadian political leaders to talk about domestic issues of everyday life rather than focusing this election on the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)," he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about."
The ambassador understands all the less this "deafening silence" as the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically," he believes, "the ability of a candidate, a party and even more so a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote."
The other expression of this sense of importance can be found in the January 22, 2009 cable sent by Terry Breese, Chargé d'Affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival in the early February confidence vote on the federal budget, in which Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade because of a $30 billion to $40 billion stimulus package," Breese wrote.
Nowhere is there any mention that the government had to prorogue Parliament before Christmas to avoid being toppled by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed stimulus package.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that CBC drama series are sending back from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the programs Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are not very subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or kidnappings for harsh interrogations of the CIA.
Another cable reports that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to take in some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner answered yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it said, "he handed a paper to the secretary of state about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian descent."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, it should be noted that tempers are heating up regarding the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser to Stephen Harper, told CBC that the person responsible for the mass leak should be "murdered."
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate lighting
The UN proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gases (GHGs) that is almost one-third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan comes on the heels of the major concrete projects that the UN hopes to have adopted in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by compact fluorescent bulbs or, better, by light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, most of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHGs emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global car fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to reduce overall GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract from this balance still 5 Gt to stabilize by 2020 the rise of the climate at 2 degrees centigrade in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated as heat and the rest, 5%, produces light.
With compact fluorescent bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced by two more times.
Compact fluorescent bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
New LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the possible savings with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These brand new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emitting very little heat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about compact fluorescent light bulbs because they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place guidelines.
But, the report says, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent light bulb, but rather coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in glowing bulbs.
In the U.S. alone, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains each country would make as a result of this international program.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost it 2.5 billion to build.
Côte d'Ivoire waits nervously for election results to be announced
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the publication "without delay" of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the deadlines have expired.
"The secretary-general stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," said a spokesman for the UN chief.
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to show responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the announcement of the provisional results."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission let the Wednesday midnight deadline pass without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's vote.
About forty minutes before the deadline expired, the president of the IEC had said on television that the commission was "continuing to work" to announce the results.
Calls multiplied Wednesday in the world for the IEC to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the incumbent Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the Constitutional Council cancelling "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former rebellion of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the Ivorian president's campaign manager, said FN voter intimidation in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the incumbent from voting.
The entire election could be annulled if Gbagbo's complaints are upheld by the Constitutional Council.
But Gbagbo's opponents say the country's highest court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any link with the former rebels, called the delay in announcing the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies say Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from releasing the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that had been split in two for years.
The United Nations warned Ivorian politicians on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished first in the first round, on October 31, with 38% of the vote against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France as defined by the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including the overseas departments), show provisional seasonally adjusted data (CVS) published Thursday by INSEE.
The number of unemployed stands at 2.631 million in metropolitan France.
The data for the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the working population in metropolitan France and 9.7% with the French overseas departments.
Over one year, the unemployment rate rose by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for work.
The situation of young people on the labour market has deteriorated further, with a further rise in the unemployment rate, brought to 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points over three months, + 0.5 points over one year) and 25% including the French overseas departments.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed as defined by the ILO.
Seniors experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points over three months as well as over one year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with the French overseas departments.
Only 25-49 year olds enjoyed stable unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% throughout the France.
INSEE has not published a monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the statistics agency of the European Union, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for the France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the Bouches-du-Rhône General Council, was indicted and imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini was indicted for misuse of company assets, embezzlement of funds and public property, concealment, active corruption, influence peddling and possession of ammunition, says his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and wants to explain himself on all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, and not fantasies."
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible charges, it is another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before the hearing of his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strong man of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, insisted, through his lawyers, to pass the judge before his hearing a memo to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also indicted Wednesday night and imprisoned.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything other than operate the landfills he had to manage.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of funds related to their operation, he was never aware of it, said Mr. Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was indicted Wednesday for embezzlement of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with prohibition to meet the protagonists of the case.
"My client was able to provide explanations for the charges against him."
"The investigating magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of liberty," said his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
Four other people had been indicted and released in the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, with placement under judicial control for two of them, said the deputy prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager for cleaning of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "influence peddling and passive corruption".
Two officials of the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are indicted one for "embezzlement and misappropriation of public property by a person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complicity in embezzlement of public funds".
Finally the companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was indicted for "concealment of abuse of social property".
Among those who have been confronted with Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies of being used to launder money from organized crime.
The investigation is being conducted in the context of several judicial investigations opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous letters, for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
According to a source close to the investigation, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as from certain cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysee exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", kept public opinion in suspense in France, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of the underside of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice for dealing with their own "hostage" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman had not been counterpart to the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by American justice for trafficking materials for the benefit of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they cast a harsh light on the way in which the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to lend credence to the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, this was not the case.
A diplomatic cable written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage cases".
The Elysée Councillor for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, meet with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise the Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise", they say, "hammer incessantly" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate liberation".
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is sensitive to its image.
"Do it especially since the Iranians are asking you not to."
Because, after attempts at discussions through discreet channels, "silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "masters of delaying tactics".
Richier added that arresting foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail."
He announced that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day she took refuge in the embassy of France) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large sum of money" (230,000 euros bail).
And he says that the Elysee anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for twelve days, but remains stranded in Iran.
Information is disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is seeking for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, by decision of a judge.
The U.S. embassy, like many observers, is wondering about this troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks Iranian clandestine networks for the acquisition of equipment for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did the France agree to a bargain?
The release of the Iranian against that of the French?
During a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysee, he said, was not only "completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision," but sought to oppose it.
"There were lively exchanges between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot go back on the decision" judicial, he observes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" surveillance of the French intelligence services.
The Elysee adviser dials a phone number, hangs up, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée spares no effort, by means of communiqués and "leaks" organized in the media, to make believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and note that the manipulation bears fruit since several press articles echo the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 evokes "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
On what is the basis of so much "gratitude" expressed towards Mr. Assad, wonders the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their laudatory statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then looks at the reasons that pushed the Elysée to fall into this fiction.
The intense communication effort "aims to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived, by many critics in France and abroad, as premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "demonstrate to Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows this from good sources.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least confuse Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriot."
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will pass a so-called "Cinderella" law that will ban teens from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to parliament in December to ask online gambling companies to block access to these games after midnight for young people under the age of 16, representatives of the ministries of culture and family said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the ministry official in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be accessible again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents request them, the official added.
It will also provide people who request it with free software that limits the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report news related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, beating 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA designates the organizing countries
In turmoil due to suspicions of corruption, the FIFA executive committee on Thursday designates the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, an eminently political choice where power struggles and lobbying risk taking precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of FIFA's premier competition will take place in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
That of 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its establishment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who are part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political stakes of a World Cup.
Behind-the-scenes negotiations are therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to FIFA's evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavily on the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, at the origin of the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, cradle of football that has hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC put a layer back on Monday, broadcasting a documentary that pins three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to displease FIFA and embarrass English officials, who have embarked on intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of government hopes to repeat the coup succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who won the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore England's image with the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the Spain-Portugal duo does not lack assets with its stadiums already ready, its expertise (World-82 in Spain, Olympics-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the gloomy economic and financial outlook for both countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, which has become a major outsider despite the shortcomings of its file (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a barely veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
"We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, with the experience of 1994, appears to be the logical favorites.
The world's leading economic power, home to FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to be one step ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have separately built a very beautiful project.
But these new candidacies seem premature for two countries that co-organized the event in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, ardently desired by FIFA, which would effectively render null and void the Asian chances for 2022.
With Qatar, which has pulled out all the stops by offering futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new countries, but these two countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights paid (due to jet lag) by European countries, the sinews of war for FIFA.
Second mandate: the obvious
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made it seem that he was hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had not the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One mandate at the Elysée calls for another.
So the present head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not mix well with the part of mystery attached to the presidential office.
So we must act as if doubt still exists.
Either way.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On 15th November, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would take his decision "somewhere in the autumn of 2011".
That he evokes in front of UMP parliamentarians, Tuesday evening at the Elysee, the prospect of "two mandates" has therefore sown a little feverishness.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far from that.
The president was merely recalling that the constitutional revision of 2008 limited the number of five-year terms to two.
He was making an observation, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has evoked the presidential election, in a humorous tone, during such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he told them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step."
His words the day before yesterday do not make him any more a candidate than the day before; they make it no less.
If they provoke comments, it is for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But it is not the entry into the race of Ségolène Royal that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS are calling for an earlier than expected battle order.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion in the UMP on this," immediately and cautiously reacted the Prime Minister's entourage.
"If he believes defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to be an opportunity to clarify the modalities for ending the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of many of the unconventional monetary policy operations due to end at the end of the year.
Due to the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt issuing institution will probably not be able to afford to be so peremptory or risk aggravating a more than tense situation today on the European bond markets.
The political cost would be all the higher.
Yesterday, during a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde praised the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
It declined to comment on whether it believed the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my thoughts for my European partners (...)".
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the president of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more divided about his intentions, simply indicating that the program of purchase of government securities on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decide" at the meeting on Thursday.
The only certainty: the ECB will keep its main interest rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of Treasury bonds by the ECB doubled last week to nearly €1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, Eurosystem central banks have purchased €67 billion since May 2010.
Among market participants, there is no doubt about expectations of further buying (see page 29).
Economists also do not expect a noticeable change of course.
While lending operations of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still allocates unlimited liquidity on generous terms and for maturities ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this arrangement to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine her changing her program in any significant way."
"Otherwise it would be taking the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A gradual exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," said Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of these bonds to animate a sluggish market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the large exposures of European banks to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It must at all costs replace the lack of investors on the market and act in such a way as to prevent a runaway yield paid by the most fragile states," said a major bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates soar, governments will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
The safeguarding of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is doing the round back
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation eased a little yesterday with the decline in 10-year bond yields.
A return to precarious calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of the Economy, the presidents of the regions said they had heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which the interested party then denied.
On Tuesday in any case, the spread with German long rates had reached the record of 210 basis points and the price of hedging contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had soared to 263 points, causing some panic in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain the spread with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "deeply concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the sluggishness of tax revenues that goes with it, running the risk of the State no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget currently being examined by the Senate is counting on 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, calculates the European Commission the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of the GDP next year (against 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour of a new budget collective that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken," said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been saying this for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, neither in the short nor in the long term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, editor's note), the stabilisation efforts required of Italy are less than those required of other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
There remains the question of political instability.
On 14th December Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, following which early elections could be organised at the end of March.
This would open up a period that is not conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde hammered it again yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I think we demonstrated it again on Sunday during the day and in the night, are obviously united, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although relative, yesterday's easing on European government bond yields has provided grist to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet speak of the beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it could downgrade Portugal's debt rating, the target most targeted today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs in particular on banking systems," said economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this gap and the dangers it contains, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis measures.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are well underway.
This is also in view of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the crosshairs of the markets (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform Far Eastern investors of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first issues of EFSF securities are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the U.S. would support a possible increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries that are on the front line, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in terms of labour market organisation.
These reforms are in addition to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from Greece and Ireland.
Both are keen at all costs to avoid asking for international assistance before implementing their own fiscal corrections and deciding on the structural reforms needed to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European lenders discuss the options available to accelerate the process of normalization of sovereign bond markets.
Passing through Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to put forward the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to put its hand back in the wallet.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a major player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of around 100 billion euros would suffice, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism with EUR 60 billion to date.
A council that is likely to be carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
Snowy episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on orange alert because of the risk of snow and ice.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne, were added to the 20 departments already on orange alert, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, sustained snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows lightly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, occasionally from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snowy episodes are notable enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departmental roads have been banned for heavy goods vehicles over 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend taking your vehicle only when necessary and the circulation of some TER buses has been suspended for the day.
School transport has been banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were envisaged Wednesday evening to restrict the circulation of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to be very careful on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel Thursday 25% of their flights at Paris Roissy airport and 10% at Orly because of the upcoming snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the time that the debate around the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France is in full swing, billions have been raining down.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion euros are mentioned for the Grand Paris metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the State announced a capital endowment of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this sum that will then allow SGP to borrow on the markets a share of the financing of its double loop.
Today, we finally come to the first additions.
The 2010 amending finance law, examined by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the mechanisms planned to find the beginning of this money.
There are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, we read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public establishment Société du Grand Paris".
It is quantified: "The revenue from this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a reorganization of a tax on offices that already exists "in order to modernize it, increase the revenue and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring in?
Mystery.
It is not encrypted in the text.
We are far from 4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are in addition to the 4 billion euros of the capital endowment that will be mobilized by the State and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," reads the explanatory memorandum.
At the SGP, we do not find this system shocking.
"From the moment we create revenue (the two taxes, editor's note), we can cover the studies over three years and then hit in the 4 billion after, it is explained."
"It will be written into the budget and drawn as we go along."
The SGP estimates that the 4 billion will begin to be included in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the 4 billion promised are still absent subscribers, is likely to provoke a somewhat agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Avenging hackers and spys in stagecoach
The WikiLeaks affair has a double value.
On the one hand, it is an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other, it heralds profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let us proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that every dossier compiled by a secret service (of any nation) consists exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those Berlusconi owns), and Gaddafi's eerily cartoonish profile has long been sketch material for cabaret artists.
The rule that secret files should only consist of already known news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) exactly what was already written in previous works.
And this not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (nor does he know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only what they already know, and which reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
Ditto for secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited-minded) the head of the secret services (otherwise he could be, what do I know, editor of Liberation), who retains as true only what he recognizes.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the US embassy in Rome was sending to the State Department was the same as that which Newsweek published the week before.
So why have the revelations about these cases caused so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since heads of state can telephone each other or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few small exercises in representation,  have turned into spy centres.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only out of hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, repeating this publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to cast American diplomacy in the wrong light.
Second, the idea that any hacker could capture the most secret secrets of the world's most powerful country is a significant blow to the State Department's prestige.
So the scandal does not put the victims in crisis so much as the "executioners".
But let us come to the deeper nature of what happened.
Formerly, in Orwell's time, one could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every move of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been completely proven since that, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway taken and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as is happening now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control ratio ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the vengeful citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the possibility of keeping its own secrets hold?
It is true, as Georg Simmel already said, that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that everything you know about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret, because it is in the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets is to take away her power.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but did too great a credit to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer be able to put any reserved information online - this would be like publishing it on a poster stuck on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with today's technologies, it is futile to hope to be able to maintain confidential reports over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state flew and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved relations be maintained in the future?
I am well aware that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and therefore romantic, but I am forced to imagine government agents moving discreetly in stagecoaches with uncontrollable routes, carrying only messages learned by heart or, at most, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept in a single copy in locked drawers: basically, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now advancing in crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet re-established a wire (telephone) telegraph.
(Analog) videocassettes had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going back and forth and discovering all the secrets of editing, whereas now (digital) CDs only allow you to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macro portions.
With high-speed trains, you go from Rome to Milan in three hours, whereas by plane, and the trips it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that politics and communications technology should return to horse-drawn carriages.
One final observation.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was going on in the secrecy of embassies.
Now it is the embassies that request confidential information from the press.
Climate: how the France is tinkering with its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to review the fulfilment of the pledges of fast-release financing (so-called fast start or early-stage financing) made by developed countries.
And the big French hacks are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries committed $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged €7.2 billion over three years and the France €1.26 billion (€420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU pulled out all the stops to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast-start financing: a report detailing the action of its Member States, a press conference, a big side event, distribution of brochures...
The transparency exercise is valuable and appreciated: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has made €2.2 billion available in 2010, putting it on track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Accord, this money must be "new and additional", in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of Official Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some member states including the France blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has taken 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years under fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
On the other hand, the France considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to previous years' expenditures or to the overall level of Official Development Assistance.
Concretely, the total amount of France support to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment in terms of "new and additional" financing...
Another crucial element is the distribution between grants and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, like the France, consider that 1 € lent is equivalent to 1 € given.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions that rely on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... At most, only the cost of the loan to the lending country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be counted as part of its commitments.
But the France does not care about such reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% grants (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts €1 to meet its commitment, the France puts only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice sleight of hand!
In summary, in its fast-start financing, the France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of the action over time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only 36.1 million euros, it manages to make believe that it spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter on early financing is only a small question, of relative short-term, compared to the whole climate discussion.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn the lessons of this first year of early funding.
First of all, the France could announce a change in its accounting method for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, the France could advance discussions on the issues of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently being discussed): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans.
The France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
Hope therefore rests on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on the France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Alert to pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemical substances in one day, according to a study published on Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (formerly the Movement for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no statistically significant value in view of the small number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", bought between July and September the food generally consumed in four meals and a snack in one day by a child of about ten years, in the supermarkets of the Oise and Paris.
These typical meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as treats, were examined by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance sheet of the plate is damning: 81 chemical substances, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as certain carcinogens as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EDCs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical substance taken individually are not exceeded, it is clear in our survey that the reality of consumer exposure to possibly carcinogenic contaminants and / or EDC is worrying," notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven to be certain carcinogens as well as nearly twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack by the study, has traces of six chemical substances including a fungicide yet banned in France.
The same goes for green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a strong insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, ground steak, canned tuna, and even bread baguette and chewing gum were riddled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water the analyzes revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues detected and even examining the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not exempt from it.
The final risk to the consumer of this "cocktails of contaminants" "is probably underestimated," according to the study.
The Europe Ecology-Greens Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "in the face of the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase in diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
