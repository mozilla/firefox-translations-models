Barack Obama will be the fourth US President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo to Norway to spend 26 hours and be the fourth US president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The diploma, medal and cheque of 1.4 million dollars will be awarded to him, among other things, for his exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a busy programme.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple's schedule then included an interview with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The visit will come to his pinnacle in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth US President to receive it, but only the third award will be awarded the prize in the Committee.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the award ceremony.
The President does not want to avoid this subject because he is aware that he is receiving this prize by being a president who is waging a war in two countries at the moment.
It strengthened the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of its critics will forget to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check of ten million Swedish kronor (about 1.1 million euros).
He intends to donate it to charities, but he has not yet decided in practice which ones.
His programme will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 guests.
Obama was rather reluctant to do so at first.
He mentioned, for example, that he did not fully deem it.
He also repeated several times that this is not a prize for himself, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
As soon as he was announced, he said that this would be an "invitation to act".
Nature defender accused of blackmail
The Litom-ice police charged the president of the association Society of Nature Protectors of Litomici with blackmail.
On several occasions last year he called on several construction yard proceedings and asked for money from investors for his personal benefit in exchange for withdrawing his appeal, said Alena Romova, spokesman for the Litociice police.
The president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litomsice is Lubomur Studnyika.
He is currently in detention and at risk of up to three years'imprisonment.
Waste sorting skips are not perfume in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort out their beverage packages, while in the villages of South Moravia you come across sorting dumpsters on every street corner.
What about Brno?
Here, you would have to take several minutes before finding the right ski lifts.
I don't mean we wouldn't sort the waste at all in Brno.
But I have the impression that the city councillors in our city, the second largest city in the country, are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is in the Stone Age of sorting waste not only because citizens can only sort paper, glass and PVC, but especially in view of the number of dumpsters dedicated to this waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city centre?
It's a whole science, which requires mostly time and nerves of steel.
The only place I've found right now is Moravia Square in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues do not resent me, but it seems damn little to me.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city it's not a sinecure either.
So, a lot of my friends don't sort their waste.
Out of laziness.
It makes them a trot to get to the dumpsters.
I'm not surprised by them.
I myself, after a party, offered to throw away a few glass bottles and PVC.
Except I didn't see any dumpsters on Kounicova Street.
Luckily, I found the right place by going to take the tram.
That said, the waste was spilling over.
It's after all the center of Brno, who's supposed to be the best of the city, right?
It is probably because ecology and so-called aestheticism are not of too much interest to the Brno socialists.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first hockey league that shames the city throughout the country, instead of buying a few extra dumpsters and offering sorting more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I was able to confirm my impression with official statistics after hanging around the Internet for a while.
According to data from the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire southern Moravia region.
Paroubek budget took away money from pensions and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the government's view, farmers or civil servants, it may lack money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on State debt or international judicial procedures.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for some classes, they were based on the fact that the government would make loans for sensitive spending, pensions or sick leave. "It's just posting problems, undermining the field," said Janota.
It should be borne in mind that the money borrowed on the interest to be paid is increasing and that it will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state has no real choice as to where to draw money.
If it does not reduce social assistance or expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those who have been on the rise of the left: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and must not fear their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of greater government debt – next year there will be no shortage of 163 billion in the coffers, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will thus grow faster and faster and with it, interest-related spending.
The state will need money to repay it, and it will no longer be enough to increase VAT slightly or to reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
It will also miss five billion to complete road and rail constructions due to the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly sections already decided and started which are not possible to modify projects in order to possibly reduce costs.
At most, which is not free of charge either.
This means delaying or stopping 30 major projects, and the withdrawal of European funds is also at risk, according to the warning of Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The SSD has proposed to resolve the very clever financial deficit - it will draw on the dividends of the electricity supply and distributor, which the State has for the most part and will supply the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is by no means a bottomless well.
Last year, 18 billion were sailed from the budget to the budget.
Every year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of environmental damage, to supplement pension accounts or to serve as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
Moreover, this trick increases the real deficit of the budget to 5.7% of GNP under EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensations to victims of communism and crime, and even housing savings, has fallen by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save on the department side or, at worst, to the government’s budget reserve.
The State Cash project is also missing worth EUR 2 billion, which is intended to track the expenditure of each administration online.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister could not find any money elsewhere, the bill would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed look promising.
Just one button and you switch from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the objective of the American company VMware, which is mainly concerned with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We're going to allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them into staff and professionals
Both will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and it was first demonstrated a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, a smartphone with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM, which simultaneously ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now working with European and US operators to test smartphone virtualisation, and customers should have access to devices during 2012.
The shortage of snow in the mountains is bothering hoteliers
Desert tracks are not a problem only for ski lift operators.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking their skiing trips in hotels and guest houses.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits to our website.
Internet users browse the offers, ask for prices but do not dare to commit to booking for the time being.
And if they call us, they ask right away if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl.Info news portal.
If you want to spend the New Year's day of your dreams at 'pindler'v Mlon', it is better no longer to hesitate to book.
If savings are given priority and the quality of accommodation comes only afterwards, then we can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers of the city currently offer only one-week stays for the New Year.
I think they will try to put them up for a while, but they will also give in and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," said Jandura.
The Tourist Agency Ingtours du Vrchlab also offers free beds for all winter periods.
We're most interested in Christmas week at the moment, it's not completely sold.
There is still freedom, let's say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared a few cheaper last-minute Christmas trips," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The tourist agency of Vrchlab can also offer the New Year in Krkonoe, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February also leave, the remaining winter stays sell for a medium.
This year, interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoe.
People are waiting for her to start falling.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas will also be complete," Schiefert thought.
In contrast, the occupation of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Snukou is slightly higher than last year.
There is an improvement of about five percent.
We still have a few final places for the New Year and for Christmas.
There is great interest during the Polish holidays of January and February is selling well as," says Karel Rada, manager of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel is also complete, near the central car park of Junske Luzna, is also complete, at a low percentage during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the newest hotel in Junské Luzno.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have 60 per cent of occupations today.
February is a little weaker at the moment but as soon as the snow falls, interest in stays in the Krkonoia will certainly grow again, said Hotel manager Erik Sporysch.
However, the hoteliers of the Krkonoe must not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be cooler and if there is rainfall, it should be snowy in the mountains.
Afterwards, however, the weather is expected to warm, according to Jic Jakubska of the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United States: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
He even becomes comical, the hard-working effort with which Barack Obama, president with a wise reputation, replicates his predecessor’s strategy on the Afghan issue, which he himself considered simple.
When he finally let his doctrine so eagerly emptive, he turned out to have copied it with carbon paper since Bush’s Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times the phrase 'as in Iraq', he did not hesitate, moreover, to use the title of Bush's 2007 speech as the title of his own speech: "A new road ahead".
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements to a civil-war-gustled Iraq as "irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences."
In the following months, however, it showed that Bush's strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of the campaign commanders, was the only one possible and likely to be so successful that the newspapers at present do not talk about Iraq at all.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, however, objectively speaking, he left his successor a very more favourable final situation than could have been hoped.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again.
Campaign commanders again called for an increase in the military contingent, including the Afghan Operation Commander, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the White House's reluctance despite the habits of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men in order to be able to make the situation more favourable.
The president hesitated for three months, but if he did not have a better option, he at least defrauded the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to extricate the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, although it originally had 10,000.
What brings the most problems in all of Obama’s strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies of Afghanistan within 18 months and complete this entire process within three years. Obama’s entire doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that an increase in half will bring the same fruits as the advance in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders are honouring the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is marked by the exact opposite -- no one can be relied upon and no treaty is respected.
In these circumstances, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, who are accustomed to changing their heads on a day-to-day basis according to what suits them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain nothing but dull behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity as to the reports, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "prompt state to act", which is the basic goal of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy puzzles his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the verge of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and out-of-real-life heart can be persuaded that the little soldiers sent into the tumult of the war for their "prompt back home" will bring a real miracle.
From a political point of view, defining a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, since the Taliban will regard it as the indirect admission of the American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that the will of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is oriented towards the negative.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their constituents how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of Iran-related events.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of solving the problem through the use of military force.
This will be answered, for example, at a time when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Each solution of this kind, however, will lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only stubborn for Obama is the fact that he stays three years until the presidential election, and so there is still enough time for him to work on a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs Bank executives will no longer receive cash premiums
The senior executives of the US Goldman Sachs Bank will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced this to respond to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior leaders will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell for five years.
Actions can be withdrawn from leaders in the event that they take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs set the lead in the effort to link rewards with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I guess Wall Street is well aware of the global meaning that needs to be taken, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after setting aside almost 17 billion dollars for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums is likely to exceed 20 billion dollars despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the onset of the financial crisis, high premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it expects to spend a single tax of fifty percent bankers' bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics
Five women, a record number, have received the Nobel Prize in technical disciplines and literature in Stockholm today from King Charles XVI Gustave in technical disciplines and literature.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also the Romanian-born German writer Herta Muller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their Chromosome Research.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to the Isralian Ada Jonath with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clearing the structure and function of the ribosomes.
The last laureate was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, Elinor Ostrom with fellow countryman Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have a laureate this year was physics.
The award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of fibre optics and George Smith with William Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner was awarded the diploma, the Nobel Medal and the Certificate of Easy Award.
This amounts to SEK 10 million in each category. (approximately EUR 1.1 million)
If one of them has more than one winner, they will share the reward with each other.
The much-anticipated Nobel Peace Prize has already been presented this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, to US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward, since he is only at the beginning of his journey and he is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the disgrace of his policy, he added that in some situations war was essential for peace, even if the price was high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is weighing his stay in the government as a result of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted on by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps Janota's position in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
In his view, the deficit was too large, which further deepened the public finance crisis.
Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat briefed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss her position on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget that will be submitted to Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday validated the left's proposals on money transfers and increased the remuneration of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed Social Democrats' proposals for them to indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left, on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other, which calls into question the future of Fischer's cabinet, which was formed by agreement between the ODS, the SSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as voted by MEPs, abolishes the package of cost-saving measures passed by the Fischer government and which, in its view, must stem state indebtedness.
Klaus, who can ratify the law on the state budget but which there is no obligation to do so, said today at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs that politicians have long neglected the 'serious problem' of the 'irreminent deficit' of public finances.
There is now no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could bring an improvement if it could build on a broader political party consensus, according to the president.
ODS President Mirek Topolanek said that the budget was staggering and that the government should question its subsequent existence.
The vice-president of the ODS Petr Neas told the 'TK' that the idea of an administrative firm supported by the SSD, the ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer called such words 'dramatic verdicts'.
The leader of the SSD Jic Paroubek reacted to Topolanek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Topolinek government is frightening and that it will exceed DKK 200 billion.
Already on Wednesday, the SSD described the ratification of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman to star in Clint Eastwood's new film
Despite criticism of the fact that the leading roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood Invictus film - Undefeated will expose a lot to the world about the country, its fighting, and its victories.
History speaks of sport, relations between races and Nelson Mandela.
American Oscar-winning actor Morgan Freeman portrays the film about the life of Nelson Mandela, an indefatigable fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said, it was a ninety- 11-year-old Mandela who asked him to play him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I have to play you, I should be able to see you personally..
The seventy-two-year-old actor who was awarded a prize for his role in Clint Eastwood's drama Milion Dollar Baby in the boxing business circled, for example, as the leader of a movement against slavery that has become himself a slave, a fictional US president, or even God in the film Evan Almighty but never someone else's lively.
The former South African statesman was imprisoned for 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning undefeated and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. President Mandela, the newly elected President, knows that his country still remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He was convinced that he could unite his people through sport and decided to unite the rugby players who were among the outsiders in the world.
The South African team will eventually progress to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela's story to the big screen.
I had no other purpose but to play this role in such a way as to bring it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was of course to speak like him.
The actor stated that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake hands with you, I get back from your energy, it's being passed on and I felt like I knew how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon starred in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor stated that he was six months old to prepare for a role in the middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I rang at the door of the house, it opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: 'I look much bigger in the film'.
Despite the differences between the actors and the actual models, Invictus under the leadership of Eastwood received positive reviews and even talk about ambitions for the Oscars.
Daily Variety's film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very good film made."
In film evaluations on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange light phenomenon of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only admitted that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from Norway's borders.
But the launch was still a failure, and the "Bulava" missile, which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is gradually becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during the rocket testing did not have the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava did not fly away, or it got damaged in mid-flight.
Russian newspapers talk about "Bulava" as "missile that doesn't fly"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th test was scheduled at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was again damage to the aircraft.
It was clearly the engine on the third stage of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew away from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij who was navigating beneath the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be precisely ignited by a boat in motion and immersed.
This is why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably so by a faulty "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time we cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket resisted and the damage affected only the third.
In the preceding cases, the engines have experienced failures on the first stage.
Although none of the test launches went smoothly, the Department of Defense leadership considered that only six out of thirteen had failed.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and they therefore always say that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will even carry ten hypersonic nuclear nucleus with a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetissov will again appear in a professional match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder, will assist his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably enter Friday's match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of 40 in 1998, is currently the President of CSKA.
After the injury of Denis Kuliash we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to assist the team.
We still have to sort out some details of the form, says club coach Sergey Nyemchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the legendary hockey player's comeback will only be one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov became the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, legendary striker Gordie Howe played a season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Fetissov quint, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players.
Under the Soviet Union he won gold twice at the Olympics, seven world championships, he won the Canada Cup and the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also earned tributes to the NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai listened to trade unions and canceled all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in Nosovice agreed with the trade unions to cancel all overtime.
It was precisely because of the frequent overtime that the trade unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
The Hyundai factory spokesman Petr Vanak confirmed this.
However, the management wants to agree again with the trade unions on a Saturday that has been working again this year.
We can't give up our production plan, it's essential, that's why voluntary overtime was offered on Saturday, December 19 knowing that there would be two teams, said Vanik.
The company reported that the company offered a bonus of Czech kroons 400 to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be awarded after the day worked on 28 November.
According to Vanak, the company decided to change the way it motivated its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the extra hourly supplement, or they can take a replacement leave on 28 December and thus extend their end-of-year festivities indicated Vanik.
In addition to this, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and for their lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and demands of both trade unions and employees who spontaneously ceased production last week, the management took the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, said Vanik.
Until last week, employees at the car factory were forced to work almost two hours of overtime in addition to eight hours.
The trade unions intend to cancel the strike state after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the management of the car factory and the trade unions is scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchay said on Wednesday that they were ready to stop the strike in the event of agreement on their claims and the signing of a joint document.
The situation in the factory peaked last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to incessant overtime.
They also protested against poor wage and so-called hazing conditions.
Management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work in addition to fulfilling the requirements for car production.
When the strike was announced on Monday, the trade unions also called for no sanctions to be imposed on employees who had ceased production.
Trade unions are asking society to keep the time spent on overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a reward of 5,000 kroner (about 209 dollars) for them.
The Hyundai car factory in Nosovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started mass production last year in November.
It manufactured about 80,000 vehicles until September this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech Discovery: a substance that works on "Winning" HIV viruses too
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow down the proliferation of HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to medicines.
This reality takes precedence, in some cases, over the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on the common variants of the virus as well as certain medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the moment.
However, the lives of patients can be radically prolonged via a mixture of medicines that prevent the multiplication of HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption leads to a series of side effects.
Moreover, the suppression of this multiplication has the effect of the development of so-called resistant viruses on which the drugs no longer have any effect.
The work of the experts of three institutions, the Czech Academy of Sciences, the Prague VCHT and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for dealing with the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalcarboranes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers' work leads them to discover new 'improved' substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bonds on the virus's proteins.
Metalcarboranes have a single three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are formed by boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A traitorous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is an HIV virus protein that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by HIV protease there would be no mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, the virus spread in the patient's body will also be stopped, the researchers say in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Republic's Academy of Sciences.
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic link, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases was tested in test specimens as well as on its resistant variants obtained from patients infected with HIV.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however it does not weaken on resistant versions against which common drugs are often ineffective.
Metallocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications are therefore interesting combinations to be examined further towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlanna zezov, director of the laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Genetics.
Dispute over the budget. The ODS attacks Fischer, who defends himself
The president of the ODS (Civic Democratic Party), Mirek Topolonek, described as "eradicating" the budget ratified for the following year, and he said that Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should question its existence.
The Prime Minister described the purpose of the ODS as a drastic verdict.
He says he takes time to analyze.
ODS spokesman Petr Neias said that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the SSD, the ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Neias, the Head of Government should decide whether to support the minority in the minority, or whether he is concerned with the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Neias warned that the ODS and Social Democrats’ positions on the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified the budget for the year 2010 on Wednesday, but with the proposed amendments of 12 billion kroons included by the left.
The Chamber increased the money for civil servants'salaries, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's claim to the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's wish that a modified budget is a less poor variant than a temporary agency budget.
Disappointment and use
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer has indicated that the government will think again about the current situation.
Nezas was convinced that if Janota threatened to leave his post if the proposed amendments were ratified, the situation might be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment with the Prime Minister on Monday after his visit to the government:
At the same time, he said that he wondered whether he would remain in his post.
His disappointment with the budget negotiations is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Neaas believes that the representatives of the SSD, who have imposed the changes in the budget, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other laws increasing the deficit, such as those relating to health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolanek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the business of the head of the Fischer government and the entire government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing harmful, Topolinek stressed in a textual communiqué from the United States.
He recalled that the vice-ministers of certain ministries claimed to be TOP 09, which had voted against the budget.
Neas stressed that if Fischer decided to resign in the face of fighting the amount of the public finance deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House. "
Having said that, he should not expect the support and tolerance of democrats.
I haven't thought about it and once it's on the agenda, I've been talking about it, told journalists, the Minister of Defence Martin Bark, who was elected to the government by the Democrats, has been elected to the government.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS backtracked at the Prime Minister's request.
At the same time, the ODS would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not specifically asked the Democratic MPs to allow the budget to vote.
We do not feel that we are orphans, we are not small children, he said to the question of whether the ODS had not been reproached by the President of the Party in the House or in the country during the budget negotiations.
I did not notice that my vote would have been missing.
I already knew when I gave up my term of office that what would follow in the following months would be a bolchévisation of the House and a destruction of all the positive, he was reacting to Topolinek in person.
According to the new timetables of the DA there will be fewer trains for the same fares.
Czech Railways will remove or restrict from 13 December certain express or regional trains with less loaded and will instead strengthen some others.
Total transport coverage will fall on the day of entry into force of new timetables by two per cent compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic and reduced fares.
For example, it is the inhabitants of the Ostrava region who will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino train.
On the contrary, an express will cease to serve Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the Prague-Pesek-Seko-Bedjovice-Seko-Bedjovice-Letohrad-Large-Letohrad-Peské Bud-jojovice-Ship-Bed-Bedjo-Bed-Bed-jo-Buz-Seko-B
At the regional level, the largest reduction in transport concerns the Hradec Krolové region by a total of eight per cent, while Prague and its surroundings can welcome an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague-Tabor-Tabor-Seko-Budjovice-Sekojovice-Ship-Budjovice-Ship-Tabor-Tabor-Tabor-Tabor-Tabor-Tabor-Tabor-Tabor-Tabor-Tabor-Tabor-Tabor-Tabor-Tabor-Tabor-Tabor-Tabor-Tabor-Tabor-Tabor-Tabor-Tabor-T
Among the largest changes are the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the time being, the inhabitants of Milovice are due to change in Lysa nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, which is possible through the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysa nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at the main station in Prague (Praha Hlavna ndra).
The D will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to zumperk/Jesenok will start at two-hour intervals.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
The bill this year for regional railways is an additional 200 million kroons.
Express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport and will pay to the Railways next year in a total of four billion kroner to pay for visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are being ordered by regions that will pay for their own a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will contribute almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a ten-year contract, until now the duration has been one year.
Railways appreciate the system, which also explains why they have not used a price increase for the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will only affect one-day tickets and discounted eLi-ka internet tickets.
For passengers without a discount card, the price of zD Net will be increased from 450 to 600 kroons.
The price of eLiika will be newly dependent on the route travelled, whereas until then it was valid between cities of a region of choice and was at a single rate of 160 kroons.
Filipino rebels still retain more than 50 people, children have been released
The rebels have now abducted 75 people in the southern Philippines, including some primary school students and their primary school teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed this, but which originally spoke of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used the hostages as human shields in a flight from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AFP, the police first sued the kidnappers as a result of violence caused in settling accounts between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in Maguindanao province in the southern Philippines because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre related to the elections of the governor's administration were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippine province was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
South Africa's history is about everyone, according to Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in theaters in the United States in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporaen), and narrated part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the global combatant against apartheid has reverted to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theaters, the feedback from critics and the audience is heard.
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of spirit, and in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes, since it is being presented at a time when, on the one hand, South Africa is in the midst of preparations for the football World Cup, and on the other hand because the media are being agitated by worrying news about the increase in racial conflict and discrimination on the part of the black majority in power.
According to AP, reactions to the new film are currently rather positive in South Africa, despite frequent reservations about the leading roles in "paveloping" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, resuming his own words, is proud of the film.
I dreamed of this role for many years and I prepared well.
I also met Nelson Mandela many times personally to be able - as they say - to recover from his energy, he said at the film's official premiere in Los Angeles.
I think that is a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember Mandela's personality and message via the film.
This is the story of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns each individual added.
Wear the national rugby team jersey
The film based on the story of the novel by the British writer John Carlin the title is freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that created the people to create it depicts the South African human rights defender during his tenure as President.
So during the film, Morgan Freeman tries to pick up two racial groups from a long-divided population, and Nelson Mandela in 1995 he came dressed in the South African national jersey on the World Cup lawn, which South Africa won at the time.
For showing up on the jersey lawn, which is considered something sacred in South Africa, Mandela was long cheered fourteen years ago mainly by the white public and was recognized by white populations.
Hopefully, the football championship will succeed in uniting people again into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only "black" on the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense South African situation will improve.
The white South Africans, however, are skeptical, as recently said in an interview with LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship began on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of dramming kroner in the Louny region
A fire engulfed in the morning a processor of the company zeps of the distribution centre near the municipality of Vakov na Lounsku.
According to Luka Marvan, the spokesman for the firefighters of Osta, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to allow the transformer to consume, but they reviewed their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short-circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured, and according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandotova, the incident did not endanger the secure operation of the transmission package.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of kroons, the exact figure can be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandotova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
She added that, in ten years of activity, the company had not experienced anything similar and that incidents of such incidents were isolated.
The supply of electricity was not interrupted, says the spokesperson for the North Bohemia Soia Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of households, administrations and industries was not influenced by the fire at the processing station.
A.s. It is the exclusive operator on Czech territory of the 400 kV and 220 kV transmission and power lines.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from transport units to distribution sets and line layouts with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Janaura to file defamation lawsuits against three prefects of the SSD
Student Agency owner Radim Janaura will file a lawsuit for defamation against three social Democratic prefects.
And concretely against Michal Hayek of the South Moravian region, against Radko Martina in the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesaik.
Janura pointed this out in Dvacet minut de Radiournul.
The complaint is linked to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions have ended up signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three attacked us and claimed that the mouths were made, whereas only an offer was made for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
In exchange for slander of the Student Agency, Janaura told Radiourn.
Similarly, he indicated that he had evidence that no region had proceeded in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for the European Commission for this.
Haishi considers that the filing of a complaint by Mr. Janaura represents the continuation of his media show, which serves as free advertising to his company and for his person.
I am, of course, prepared to defend my name and the name of my region, and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Janura who is manipulating public opinion and resorting to false and unlactical arguments about regional rail transport, says Hayek
He already informed last week that he will invest a few million kroner in an advertisement that will mention the unfavourable actions of the regions.
He told Radiourn that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and plan to resume it after the New Year.
He said that the campaign would target corruption in the broadest sense.
Janura began her campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of the rail links for an order of around DKK 150 billion, without issuing a call for tenders.
According to Janaura, such a way of doing things is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to the threats of a Member of the SSD.
The only threat was that if we did not stop, we could lose our bus licences.
He introduced himself as a Member of the SSD, I do not know who it is, but I will not say his name, Janaura said today to Radiourn.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococci will reverse old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
There are already voices that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are high.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines the maximum prices for vaccines that health insurance will pay.
Specialists also see a clear picture of the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococci.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If vaccination started last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the next vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of vaccine should be given between the child's 3rd and 5th month.
Already last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococci.
However, parents paid 1,600 kroons or more for a dose.
Vaccination of the youngest takes four doses.
Specialists estimate that every year health insurance spends 300 to 450,000 kroons on vaccine doses.
However, they are saving on the need for medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
Until now, the State has spent about 500,000 kroons a year on all child immunization.
Reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Junota package".
Pneumococci are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
According to hospital investigations, there are up to 28 deaths of children under the age of 10 caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced reimbursement vaccination.
Will vaccination be compulsory?
There are opinions on a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
From January onwards, it must be regulated by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovska said that compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have been able to impose at least this.
I think it is a direction that must now be followed, Kalovskac.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are not at all considering it at all at the moment, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sr.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochova, President of the Paediatric Society, acknowledges that vaccination based on volunteering has its shortcomings.
If all the children were vaccinated, we could envisage a decrease in the renewal of vaccinations "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional", says Cabrnochova.
Specialists predict that more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their infants as early as next year.
Pneumococcal vaccination also marks a break, as it is the first vaccination of children that is financed by insurance, not by the State.
Cabrnochova explained that insurance should free up funds for prevention, so they would save on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves
However, this is linked to the concerns of paediatric practitioners, which relate to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have the vaccines purchased by the insurance, as doctors received them in the same way as other vaccine products supplied by the State.
Some MEPs feared, however, that this would allow insurance to 'deduct the sums of health insurance'.
In this way, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for the insurance companies to pay them back.
It is estimated that individual paediatricians will have to invest nearly CK 40 000 per month in vaccines, which is a significant amount of money.
It'll be far from easy, according to Cabrnochova.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum Flight"
Frank Frazetta's son, a well-known illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings worth 20 million dollars (GB12 million) from his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police stated that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested while loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and in a trailer.
In her view, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the entrance to the museum in the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, aged 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press (AP) reported.
AP quoted a police officer as the young man. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, Mr. Frazetta Jr., 52, claims to have been allowed by her father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings in a storage facility," the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denies having given such permission, said the agency.
Labour defends the increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the increase in the tax and the spending cuts announced in the pre-Budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, companies and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about the deficit by postponing its decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also drew ire to attack low wages and average wages.
His main proposals include a 0.5% increase in Social Insurance and a ceiling rate of 1% on public wages from 2011.
The Anger of Social Insurance
The trade unions protested that low wages were penalized by a recession for which they were not responsible and warned that "problems" were foraging.
The fall in Social Insurance – which will make it possible to obtain about GBP 3 billion a year – has angered the world of companies, because, in his view, it is a tax on jobs when the objective should be a recovery of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than GBP 20,000 per year, will affect around 10 million workers.
MAIN ISSUES OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social insurance will increase by a further 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall even more than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
The increase in the company's profit tax for small companies has been abandoned
Tax rebate for electric cars and wind turbines
Pension increase of 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, one person earning GBP 30,000 will lose GBP 90 per year and one GBP 40,000 will lose GBP 190, while one person earning GBP 10,000 per year will earn GBP 110 more.
Ministers said that their target of halving the deficit before 2013 led to "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would put the top 5% of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary of the Treasury, refuted an increase in the tax and pointed out that a reduction in expenditure was a "drop of water in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important. They will allow us to halve the deficit, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident and that economic growth would pick up at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts of economic growth - which will influence the amount it will have to borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be closed - were in doubt after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year – much worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April – while the loan would be 3 billion GDP higher than the previous estimate.
"Failled opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new publicity campaign on Thursday warning of the "debt crisis" of Labour, claimed that the plan to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, 'cynically' evading difficult choices until after the elections - to be held in June 2010.
"They didn't show anything meaningful about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary of the Treasury of the Shadow Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
"The big announcements will be made after the elections, whoever the winner"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future reductions, in contrast to the Tory proposals that would lead to a faster and greater reduction in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money raised from higher taxes and lower spending would be used to support next year’s spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were “built on the wind.”
Nick Robinson, the BBC's political editor, claimed that the timing of announcements - such as the increase in inflation for certain disability benefits next April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor in the face of propaganda accusations, with the money simply recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is provided when people need it most and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
Balance budget
Although ministers did not publish the details of spending beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that public spending restrictions would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies has stated that Chancellor's figures imply, in the future, substantial reductions in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually only postponed," said its Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the election, whoever the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to Deloitte's Accountants.
"This has been a false pre-budget report. The markets are well aware of this."
FBI investigates "Arrests of Americans in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five US reporters suspected of extremist ties.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI stated that it was investigating whether it was the same men who had been declared missing from their home in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The US Foreign Office said that it was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian inheritance and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the accusations against them are and under what conditions they are being held," said Spokesperson Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, an FBI spokesman, claimed that the agency was aware of the arrests and that she was in contact with the families of the missing students.
'We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are missing,' she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington, D.C., claimed that the men had been arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
She said that the house was already being monitored by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, the Reuters news agency reported, but claimed that the US must "more work with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing from their homes by their families in northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian 'abuses'
Over the past two decades, human rights have been as poorly respected as ever, according to the Amnesty International report.
the report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
A man quoted in the report claimed that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another stated that he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its lack of respect for human rights.
The authorities claimed that such criticism was politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the biggest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Dozens had been sentenced to prison terms and prosecutors claimed that at least five people had been sentenced to death.
BBC correspondent Jon Leyne in Tehran now in London says that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International reported on the case of a 26-year-old computer science student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'Working with Facebook networks' and protesting against the election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still in blood and half-conscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the candidate losing in the elections, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that demonstrators detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty International also cited the case of a former detainee who said that he had been locked in a container with 75 others for more than eight weeks in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary should set up a committee to investigate post-election disturbances and the government's response, but stated that the mandate and powers of these bodies were not clear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to transform the Bristol site into a track for competition.
The Trak in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders in competition for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park trail, a small springboard preceded a 100-meter-long runway.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that the top view of the track was beautiful but it was quite intimidating.
It's a magnificent view, with all the lights of the city scintillating below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talent,' he added.
Prizes have rewarded the best voltges - or figures made on the runway.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be dropped on the melting.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French do not like the headscarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and preoccupied the country for about fifteen years and whose effects are still being felt today.
Mr. Bowen has a much broader and more ambitious frame.
Good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is happening now in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide what M. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He is very well aware of the debate between teachers and pupils about the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or mayor's office (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political tragedies that are of concern to the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the end.
The Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr. Bowen generally agreed with their fellow lawyers of a Sunni Sunni Sunni, associated with Saudi Arabia, who today make up a small part of Europe's Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each side.
He wonders how much French politicians (and the intellectual elite that is so virulent guardian of secularism) are truly committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than growing pragmatism, it detects a "stranglehold of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that makes it up is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing are navigating in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
Knowing the history and complicated policies of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by hunting the polar bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then brave 14-year-old aspirant who had only the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young cubs, captured while swaming alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are usually usually a millionth of the surface needed for a free adult. Climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has turned green due to the algae that grew in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often recounts the threat posed by hunters to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continued in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter fighters and Inuit motorski Indians used powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating insight into what the future may be there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither amospherists nor oceanographers can accurately report the speed of change.
It's not because we're not trying.
At the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information on the melting of the ice sheet.
Cold War submarines then mapped the changes in terrain underneath the latter.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on the icebergs are of great help, but most of the work is done by hardened men camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice tributary system, formed by blue nets of brackish water pressed by frosting.
But from the above-mentioned bear to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, scheduled for 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, maybe it's going to be our turn."
Marines, among the 6,000 people who laid wreaths on graves at Arlington
First class De'Angello Robinson, 19, made a seven-hour bus trip to lay a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery Cemetery to decorate the graves, that day was dedicated to greeting men and women who were once in their place.
In a few months, from which we will be sent, we risk being in their place, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If I did, I would like someone to do the same for me, which is why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers to gather on Saturday morning to lay wreaths at veterans' graves in different sections of Arlington Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Cemetery Cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen are making the journey every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 kroons on the tombs of Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the tombs of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and the memorial site for victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than 150,000 dollars to buy and transport the kroner.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, stated that she had made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed themselves.
This is a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family tomb.
Wipped in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between the lawns and the extensive hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers chose old graves, dating from the First and Second World Wars, as well as from the Vietnam War, as they are not as often visited as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, as the children played and the couples stood by the hand, carrying the fresh pine wrists on the gray graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red bowtie on the top.
Nearby, silenced Section 60, where most veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 kroner to decorate the section, but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals cried without hiding, others prayed and families and friends supported themselves in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names carved in stone while others leaned over to see the small black and white information maps, sunk into the wetland for those whose graves had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears, on her son's grave.
She left Ohio and had taken eight hours to collect at the grave of Marine Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in action in July.
No one should ever forget because we're free... my son paid for that, she said.
"Shortly after I'm gone, I want someone to remember him."
American national arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban Government has arrested a United States national who distributes mobile phones and laptops in the country, the US Foreign Office has said.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and World Bank.
The consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana is trying to have access to the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being “dangerous”.
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sanchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are husband and are being followed up and harassed by government agents.
Sanchez made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but permissions have always been denied.
The detention of an American national may increase tensions between the brothers' communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which is pursuing a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by The New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government move forward in concrete stages, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the US can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptop computers are allowed in Cuba, although it is new and desired consumer goods in a country where the average salary of a civil servant is 15 euros per month.
Only this year has the Cuban Government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texting or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a payday.
The use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and foreign visitors to the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to connect often have to communicate their names to the Government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says U.S. Press Officer Gloria Berbena. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said that she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a major mistake.
An activity that would be allowed -- to distribute mobile phones free of charge -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas Program of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a tough report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his sick elder brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban Government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, at a time when the two countries are beginning to engage in a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent plotting to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization that was supposed to prepare a plot to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying they hoped that the case would dismantle an important network of terrorist recruiters who were racing the Internet in search of young radicalized men.
Investigators claimed that they were chasing a hidden insurgent figure, known as Saifullah who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments endorsing the waves of terrorists on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, the men were guided by Saifullah, who tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, home of al-Qa'idah and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani secret service representative who was informed of the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not participating in the CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of north-eastern, which had become a refuge for terrorism.
They were considered infiltrators.
Therefore, they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on condition that he remained anonymous because of the confidentiality of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that the men were determined and that they were still trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to obtain entry into al-Qa'idah camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement agencies.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and who are being questioned by the FBI -- emphasize the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential and perhaps more important terrorists in reaching out to people to trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the United States secret service has been given priority to infiltrating men into the al-Qa'idah network.
The organization's recruiters act as barrier guards, denying entry to those who do not show serious engagement and those who may turn out to be spies.
According to analysts, potential United States recruits are closely studied by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, a US-based NEFA Foundation expert, said that terrorist groups must also pay more and more attention in recent years to the choice of people they accept as the US secret services have become experts on their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment model that so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen call for climate action
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked the streets here on Saturday, calling for greater climate action by negotiators working in the city's Bella Convention Center.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
The event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit a few explosives near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On this day when little happened in the United Nations-sponsored climate discussions, thousands of activists walked through the city, deploying placards in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish, saying 'The Earth says it has had enough'.
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the top model and Danish photographer, Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother's home country, Peru, opened her eyes to the heartbreaking problems facing the country due to the impact of climate change that is already happening."
That's one of the reasons why I decided to join the big march -- to spread the word and appeal to world leaders to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella centre and said that they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
The police prevented the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella centre and said that they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passer-by who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in climate discussions, activists who wore black masks and clothes lit several explosives near the main canal in Copenhagen which is surrounded by some ministries.
They would throw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around television screens to follow the procedure throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters failed to awaken the consciences of key authorities such as China’s climate representative, Su Wei.
When asked whether he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English "In fact, this is something of which I was not aware.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "The event being important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking could seem harmful or useful depending on the outlook.
It shows the interest of the general public and the various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, 'you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others.'
Test results reveal persistent differences between races
Last week's federal report on mathematical performance brought good news to Washington, D.C.
Although the District still lags behind leading institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are much more progressed in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures in the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between African-American and white performance, both local and national.
The average performance of Grade 4 (cm1) white children in Washington, D.C. has increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have increased by only three percentage points, from 209 to 212.
The success gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling by only one point, from 245 to 244.
The mean white result was not included in the test results as the sample was not large enough.
The overview over a six-year period is not more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 (cm1) class, when the first NAEP report of the District was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was reduced to only 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the cluster manager, Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were propelled by white students who were already good things.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by looking at the top of the ladder, which is problematic and inconvenient, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that promotes equality in the education of the District.
I don't jump for one or two points won, said Kwame R. Brown (Adverse Democratic), Member of the Board of D.C. and whose daughter is in Grade 4 in Eaton Elementary (Elementary School).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown has said that the message of the test results is that the middle schools in the city desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect them.
But what's scary is that we don't devote enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee stated that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, targeting early school students who did not incorporate the basics of reading earlier into their school careers and who were quite behind their peers.
Every day, the mathematics curriculum, for Kindergarten (maternal) Grade 6 (6th) classes focuses on games and real-life experiences, as set up in the District by former manager Clifford Janey, who is also to be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think we need to keep working to offer better interventions to these students below the classroom, said Rhee.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to elevate the overall results of the system while providing the money and resources for schools with poorer performance in order to narrow the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher training trainer at the University of Berkeley in California who studies city test results.
The conventional policy solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in Washington's poorest neighborhoods.
This targeting can therefore have political repercussions that hinder this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other superintendents of schools, she's trying to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We are focusing on developing a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, wherever they come from, are assured that their children can obtain an excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the key elements in bridging the success gap was the duration of traditional public school, now 180 days in Washington District, to compete with Charter Schools.
It takes about 200 days to get the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year to get 185 days, he considers a "starting point" to get another increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise for the future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, descends and blinks for a moment from the eyes to the white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela's parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition fees are 38,690 per year, her attitude was less that of an impressed new student than enthusiastic.
Great, this is where I'm going to study," exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, as the guide directed them to the entrance to the science building.
"Youpi, really?" she said, thinking, when she was told the low law professor ratio -- student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that kids visited during their three-day discovery trip and now they had fully incorporated the message: The question is not whether you go to college:
The question is where.
Although this question still arises largely for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school where parents became in their teens, they are also hundreds of thousands of them benefiting from university education that will enable them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a "second generation" Hispanic out of five students in high school -- a notable achievement considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without having finished high school.
Their success is important, the researchers say, they pave the way for succeeding generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers studying the beatings claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many parents also set high targets for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college -- especially, if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who don't have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, won't help them, said Patricia Gundra, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal programme that funded the visit to the universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepared you), it provides more than 300 million dollars a year to local school systems to organize university readiness programs that begin when students from low-income families are middle school and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been attended by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry obtains agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its struggling infrastructure in two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements obtained by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of Iraq's oil industry, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
The United States companies returned with a stake in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven US companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who had put an auction lost.
Two US companies obtained contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of US oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, have pioneered Asian and European companies, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an Internet news site.
It will take a long time for another offer to be made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as US military troops withdrew, curbed US oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq more forcefully into Iraq, which has the world’s third largest crude oil reserve, analysts say.
United States companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, particularly the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and were more likely to take risks because they were not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Ministry.
The largest United States companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintained strong ties with and provided technical advice to the Iraqi Ministry of Oil, have left empty-handed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The State-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. has more bids on contracts than other companies and has returned with significant holdings in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on par with its competitors and will deliver on its behalf in Iraq.
Companies pre-selected to submit auctions made bids which were then compared with the tariff per barrel that the Ministry agreed to pay to justify production above the current levels for each field.
One of the main al-Qa'idah organizers was reportedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that a US missile, hitting the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qa'idah operations this week, US counter-intelligence authorities said on Friday.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed that the missiles were fired by an unmanned aerial vehicle of the type used by the CIA, inside Pakistan's anarchic tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of the Pakistani civilian secret services, speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
The representatives of the authority stated that the suspicious local activists rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of the "totally shredded bodies".
It was totally impossible for the local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two United States anti-terrorist representatives gave unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of the Al-Qaida military organizers who led the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks on the United States and Europe.
It followed the strategic guidelines of al-Qa'idah leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the United States authority stated that Somali had made rapid progress in al-Qa'idest's ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to the American public, but that does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, said the second official.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important figure in al-Qa'idah or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a militant faction in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has declined since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to figures put forward by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the website claims.
United Nations Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
United Nations Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, stated on Friday that he would resign in March, ending a tumultuous mandate tainted by allegations of corruption during the United Nations-backed presidential elections.
Eide's departure comes at a time when the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the increase, but expressed concern about the United States timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he was not resigning but would simply respect his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said that he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said that it was better to start looking for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to United Nations representatives, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement.
The representatives claim that the name Staffan di Mistura was quoted as a citizen of Italy who recently presided over a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September of encouraging President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he said that Galbraith's accusations -- who was thanked -- "prejudiced the mission because there was already a good deal of skepticism about the international observation of the elections".
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of United States forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than is attributed to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in the way their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration with the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy United Nations hiring regulations hampered its ability to bring new talent.
The United Nations rules are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must face additional sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world’s major powers will soon impose “significant additional sanctions” on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a parterre of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a week-long visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, de-dramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such a resolution.
One of the things that weighs most to me is that if I've learned something in Iraq over the last six years, it's the unpredictable side of war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has pointed out that some of these sanctions could also affect Iranians on the street.
He said that a "set of motives and punishment" might be necessary to persuade the Iranian Government that it would in fact be in less good security with nuclear weapons "his people would suffer enormously from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme back in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran persists in saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experiment only for peaceful purposes.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he said that he would resume the dialogue on reducing his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon a significant part of its storage of enriched uranium, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration pushed such an agreement, a way of developing confidence on both sides and saving time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran has emerged from attempts to agree – in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the US.
Frankly, in my view, Iran's stiffening of some of the international community's proposals for which they had in fact agreed in early October, prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join in what they had not envisaged, in terms of substantial additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set Iran’s deadline of December 31 for proposals, before it turned to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “increased sanctions.”
In a statement in New York on Thursday, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls "the unfounded allegations" of some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and affirmed its agreement to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before flying to the wealthy oil region of Kurdish to meet the Troop Leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in US plans to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the Kurdish anxiety about the pending withdrawal. The US authorities quoted Gates, saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: 'We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq'.
We won't abandon you."
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by poster propaganda warning them, "Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "Another baby is a grave more".
They learned so well the lesson that the Shanghai Government authorities, alarmed by the low birth rate of their city and the ageing of the population, radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We have no second left, said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources and has an eight-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children known to be with good cheeks and spoilers, nicknamed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 per cent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that fertile couples must have babies in order to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a shortage of labour in the future".
Shanghai is about to become 'as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden', she said.
Gradual attenuation
Drafted in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is unquestionably the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and to face discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities had given the police the duty to help the country avoid a trend that was dangerous for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers had denounced abuses in the implementation of that policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women from a second child to have an abortion.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to a ratio of boys - unusually high girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they gave more exceptions to the rule -- including for urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research, Peking University, said that central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters inducing families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of retail regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government sent family planners and volunteers to meet with couples at home and slip leaflets under their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial counselling to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the family planner, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural town in the suburb of Shanghai say they saw an increase in requests for files from couples seeking a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The commune of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five requests per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still forecast to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the Shanghai Municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, stated that they would love to have two children and are legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and the health insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly consider the one-child policy to be a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
It's true, we're being swept away from having more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Officer, said that she wanted only one child because she was one herself. "We were the center of the family and used everyone to take care of us."
We're not used to taking care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
42-year-old Chen ziijian and owner of a translation company says it is more blunt.
For couples working in two, middle-class, who lower the birth rate, he says, you have to be selfish to succeed.
People aged 20 or 30 grew up seeing their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and do not want to have this lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space problems -- "you have to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only nine months old, you have to write his CV to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations group has draft plans for emission reduction
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- so far characterized by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- came back to the spotlight on Friday, due to the publication of a paper highlighting the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations supporting most of the load, in the near future.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as far as it has shed light on the way forward.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in the time-speech negotiations, with more than 100 leaders from all over the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Drafted by a UN task force, the text does not indicate how rich countries would give to the poor to support global warming, both in the long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed and emerging economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the increase in global temperature that policymakers would be willing to tolerate.
It gives the process a great deal of flexibility, said John Coequyt, Representative in Washington, Sierra Club.
The six-page of the document, Michael Cutajar, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General on United Nations climate change, Yvo de Boer, described as the "full image".
It shows guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, from 25 to 45 per cent from 1990 levels, while the main developing countries, during the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union also relaunched the negotiations on Friday, promising to provide USD 3.6 billion a year for the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change – to support floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, the US Climate Deal Representative, rejected any discussion that would require the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared to the voluntary efforts of the major emerging economies, if they were not financed by developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration is getting harder on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The US will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of the main developing countries, says Stern, who also regretted that the text did not insist enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after China’s foreign-affiliated deputy minister, He Yafei, said that the US chief negotiator, was “extremely irresponsible” or was “extremely irresponsible” for saying earlier in the week that the US would not help China financially to combat global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the world’s major powers at stake, flaws have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about rescuing individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the US quarrelling over their respective obligations, while poorer nations insist that the two dozen more influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives of acting more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers were fighting for who should suffer the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to blame the major emitters for their actions.
It's really a game in which new economic hegemony is being developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries, which are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change, have indicated that they will continue to put pressure on a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants say that negotiations will lead to a political agreement to a minimum.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of Climate Unity of the European Commission, said that the action of small island states has "pressed political pressure on the entire political process", partly by what they are now unified and that they are asking emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The discussions became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the pending problems before the heads of Government reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister took off their plane and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend closed meetings and news conferences, so that they could make claims that would be investigated the following week.
The real image of the gathering -- in which 13,000 people enter and leave the Congressional Palace every day -- guitar activists show night shows mocking countries that they believe betray and proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and no later than on Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the yard of the greats, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for Global Policy at Conservation International.
Heavy goods vehicles are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will break out at night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Great Britain.
The country's first high-speed suburban train will reach 225 km/h, while it will flow from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on the first Javelin suburban train outside London.
He hoped that the new service would enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The lost small holes will become thriving suburban cities, business travel times will be much shorter and the switch from aircraft and cars to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties are members of this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle, and fears of environmental hazards could curb Britain’s high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will enable him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new London-to-West Midlands line will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where environmental impact can be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres from the final itinerary.
It is also expected that HS2 will present three options for a larger, northerly high-speed network.
Lord Adonis will reply in the spring.
Preferred options are highlighted in a Y-configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line split into two or near Birmingham, with a branch westward from the Pennines to Merchuster and Scotland and another to the northeast, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
'It seems to be the best performance option' said a rail professional.
When it is over, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one-hour journey at present.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400 km/h, making the UK network the fastest in the world.
The original route is designed to allow trains of 400 m in length and capable of carrying 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London-Birmingham route.
A terminal capable of accommodating 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be enlarged to receive the high-speed network.
Experts from the rail industry say that only St Pancras International or Euston offers this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he believes that the project should be put in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if he launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be forced to run off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, with travel times between London and Scotland of more than three hours.
This seems to be the best solution for moving aircraft to trains, constituting a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay GBP 75,000 for Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, the main member of the Tory Parliament, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to reimburse the cost of an orangery he built in his constituency house.
The party leader who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of parliament were "maintaining", increased his loan by GBP 75,000 to build an oak extension at his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer for the additional interest at hundreds of pounds per month.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out an audit of the employees' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan stated that complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
The surrounding houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, a lounge and a dining room, but the emoluments desk states that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan to explain the increase in borrowing in the course of a recent investigation by the Commons Committee on Privileges and Standards concerning its prior borrowing provisions.
The Committee cleared him last month of any charges of non-compliance after an investigation of his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal certainty of the loan of GBP 271 406, from his London property to the house in his constituency that he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately GBP 1,400 per month's borrowing interest until March last year.
In April, his requests increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the loan of GBP 75,000.
The standard variable RBS interest rate increased from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March, this year, without moving since then.
The latest publication of the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for GBP 1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as head of the shadow cabinet in September, after a reporter supposedly filmed him, saying that members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the spending scandal.
"Actually, it's now national, you have to live 'on budget' and you're treated as 'de la m...e'.
He said, "I spent my money on my backyard and I asked for a small part, based on what was correct.
And I could have asked damn more, but I didn't."
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former post as an oil trader, began to explain his expenses in May, after it appeared that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the office of the costs that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a hole in the z-shaped hole in M Duncan's lawn, protesting after it was revealed that he had been asking for GBP 4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for major improvements, approved both by the office of fees and then by Legg."
He added: "There are no problems of evasion or drafting or using the rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It couldn't be sharper or simpler."
Faithful, come all see the Brighton Advent Calendar
Brighton's beach cabins found a new way of promoting the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, a group of the alternative church that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each December day, using Christmas songs as theme.
The event began on 1 December, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m., every day, with pâtés and mulled wine served free of charge.
The songs of Noel chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the booth presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant in Hove, is an unpaid priest from the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: 'We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a church, why do we expect people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should come closer to people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the Advent calendar of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with a few friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we're trying to experiment and represent that through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the global for climate
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where the police made several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to the police, around a thousand according to the organisers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Conference, which will lead by Friday to an agreement that can enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilisation of climate around the world, illustrated by these events, helped to make the "political price" of a very high failure in Copenhagen.
Incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the motorcade, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed entirely in black, broke windows with cobblestones and hammers, an AFP journalist observed.
Riot police officers immediately intervened smoothly.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to them to members of the "Blacks Blocks", these ultra-violent groups, which had distinguished themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of activists were arrested "without distinction", pointing out that some 100 of them "still were being held on the street on Saturday evening "kidned and kept in a seated position despite the extreme cold".
Party of Parliament, the procession, rather good child, has headed the Bella Center, the site of the negotiations.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building, without attempting to enter.
A stage had been erected to welcome the scheduled speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters had come by bus and by the train of the major cities of Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly rainproof, had formed a first gathering in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we are taking to the streets to seek compensation for the ecological debt for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep thinking, we have time," said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, rivers where you can walk the way you've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the anti-globalization movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure in alternating worldism, explained that he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "today, there is no cut between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to global warming, had launched the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, most of them students, marched in red, wearing bandanas praising solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, rallies of a few hundred demonstrators also stood to call for strong action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
On Saturday, Abkhazia elected its president, just over a year after Moscow was recognized by Moscow for the pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a "hit".
Some 131,000 people were called upon to take part in this first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
Polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
The turnout was 58 per cent hours before the end, according to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced during the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the outgoing President, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the vote.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakashvili, "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia", said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it to be part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which claimed several thousand lives, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent State, Svetlana Kvarchia, a 54-year-old historian, told AFP, who claimed to have voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a nice white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr. Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are settled throughout this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, gave a warm welcome to the Russian officials who had come to monitor the conduct of the elections.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said in a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations,” replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, by raising a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the vote by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements reached with Moscow last year, as the one ceding to Russia with control over the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he is not supporting either the current power or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round should be arranged within two weeks.
Climate: global protests, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people around the world marched around the world on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the alert, arrested nearly 700 people on the sidelines of a massive demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, some 100,000 according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until 18 December in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
As a part of Parliament, the procession, generally a good child, has taken the lead in the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the centre, without seeking to enter.
A stage had been erected to welcome the scheduled speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Moments after the train departed, a group of a few hundred demonstrators, dressed entirely in black, with bricks and hammers, broke windows, an AFP journalist.
Riot police officers immediately surrounded them and intervened in dispensingly, throwing several of them ashore.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the Black Blocks, these ultra-violent groups, which had notably been illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a policeman was injured in the jaw by a pavement and four cars set on fire near a squat in incidents that led to the arrest of some 20 people, according to police.
We have the extremist small groups in our eyes, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while the helicopters of the security forces were turning in the sky.
The majority of the demonstrators, who came by bus and by train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly rainproof, had formed a first gathering in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we are taking to the streets to seek compensation for the ecological debt for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep thinking, we have time," said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, there are streams where you can walk when you've never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the anti-globalization movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure in alternating worldism, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "today, there is no cut between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Oxfam called several personalities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen, former United Nations Refugee Commissioner Mary Robinson, who were to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to global warming, had launched the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, most of them students, demonstrated, dressed in red and wearing bandanas praising solar energy in front of the mayor of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, rallies of a few hundred protesters also called for action against climate change.

In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
Geo history strengthens the reform of the General High School, according to Chatel
National Education Minister Luc Chatel said in an interview to be published in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography were emerging from the reform of the General High School, despite the abolition of their compulsory education in senior science.
From now on, first-time students will all have four hours a week and the same programme for a shared common culture, says Mr. Chatel.
According to the minister, 'we need to get out of hypocrisy' because, according to him, 'the S sector is no longer a scientific sector' but 'in large numbers, it concentrates the best pupils'.
The ES and L sectors cannot remain sub-the-shelf, he continues, stressing that 'I have not heard many historians and intellectuals either indignants of the absence of history-month-scale geography in tech high schools'.
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L'Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French people (69%) disapproved of the government's plan to suppress compulsory teaching of history-manageography in terminals. Many intellectuals and teachers have also criticized the abolition, as well as the left and some right-wing officials.
On the other hand, the Minister added that there was no question of deleting the philosophy of the terminal programme S.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they believe is sacrificing the pedagogical training of future teachers.
As a Master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year, which will cover their discipline, and then, at the end of the year, an admission test that will focus on their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
They will also follow courses in situation during the year of M2 and will be a first year in front of the pupils as trainee teachers.
If you add up all the courses offered before the competition, you already get more attendance in front of the students, more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the Minister states that he will propose "the individual right to training, something that does not exist in national education".
It also reaffirms the project of abolishing the school card "by 2012".
In Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge faced by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (IPCC) hosted by the Ecole Normale Supérieure de la Rue d'Ulm.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a series of expert interventions, each of which was 15 minutes, filmed and open to the public, noted an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that caught people and made them want to know more, explained on the sidelines of the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo conference, one of the organizers of that day that took its name from the one given by the students to the fish in the school basin.
Some 20 speakers were selected from among the experts in their disciplines and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
On the subject of global warming, "you can talk about hours, but we can also talk about the key objectives in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, who spoke without notes, but using graphs, in front of about 50 people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that the listeners will remember that 'the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier'.
The videos from these conferences will be posted on the school's website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Payment delays: anger of prison guards, planned actions
Prisoner trade unions called on Friday for "general mobilization" to demand the payment by the end-of-year holidays of premiums and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
FO-Pneitentiary (second union of guards) has asked non-servers to demonstrate in front of the prisons on Tuesday morning and to "block them", to "declare the flight of their own".
The CGT-penetenaire, the third trade union of the profession, calls on them to "assemble in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", deeming "hamingful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "overtimes, night bonuses and public holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of guards, the Autonomous Federal Union of Prisons (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to bring back discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Prisons and the Ministry of Justice explained that overtime had increased significantly in 2009 and had not all been budgeted, but claimed that the remaining funds would be paid in January.
The Chancellery clarified at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by staff to operate and modernize our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I have asked the prison administration's management to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation, which was born of a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours does not happen again in the future, adds Ms Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be meagre, except for management staff with the famous bonuses for functions and objectives, lamented the Ufap/Unsa, for whom "the budgetary constraints have good back".
It is a pure scandal, the FO Interregional Union of Marseille was outraged, announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and convocations".
The staff will not come to work on their Sundays and public holidays if those of October are not regularized in December, the same applies to overtime, and also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff, according to the CGT-Pneitentaire de Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are less poorly off than others.
But anyway the account is not there, noted the secretary-general of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he offers "weacher tricks" than the ones he receives
US President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas with his family in the White House, told the "peather" of the small screen Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple gift rule: "I give nicer stuff than I get."
As part of a special on ABC on Sunday night, President and his wife Michelle offer a glimpse of how they want to celebrate the New Year's Eve in their prestigious News.
Even Bo, the family's four-legged little companion will be in the game.
Santa Claus also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, adding that the dog would "of course" have a gift, according to excerpts from the show aired in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed against her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: "Certainly not, I gave you nice gifts last year," she teased the president.
Absolutely, was he forced to concede before humorously retaliating by pointing fingers at the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who did you give this?"
During this one-hour, relaxed-lated show, with the famous animator who was a staunch supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama spoke of a ten-speed bicycle, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father he rarely saw gave him at Christmas.
I remember this time I met my father who came to see us for Christmas and gave me a basketball, said the president.
It wasn't until much later in my life that I realized that it was he who gave me this balloon.
The First Lady remembered her side of her dollhouse.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arranging it around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL claims he is in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to significant "lesions" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated in the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors saw "lesions resulting from the operation" of the disc herniated herniated in Paris on November 26, his press service told Paris, stating that these injuries had "need a repairing operation".
However, the singer's press service was reassuring to say that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be provided no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, a partner in the singer's latest tour, Johnny Hallyday was, however, been plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he has opened an eye, adds RTL.
When asked by AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that "according to some sources" no drain was laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the international clinic of the Parc Monceau for this herniated disc.
The procedure, which has been programmed for several days, was carried out by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a doctor well known in the artistic environment.
It was not available on Thursday evening to comment on RTL's information.
Following his surgery on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized on Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection following the operation.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close associate of Johnny Hallyday, esteemed on RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad time", but assured him to make "no concern" for the rocker, who is "a fighter".
He had called me just before leaving for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because flying twelve hours after such an operation, it's not playable, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to be reassuring, saying that Johnny Hallyday was "reacting to antibiotics" and that the infection was "indigged".
Mr. Camus had also said that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and did not notice any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only increased since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had had an "little colon cancer" and then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer took over his long "Tour 66" as planned, presenting as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been extensively discussed. Fans and journalists noticed the singer's difficulties in moving to the stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: the first of Bousquet on its favourite distance
French Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medallist in the World-2009 in the Great Basin, won an international title on Thursday over a distance that he particularly loves, the 50 m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 in the small pool in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition, when the suits are last allowed, saw only three world records broken while a flood was awaited.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in a groom 4x50 m 4n relay.
A regret for Bousquet, which looked at the world record of the 50 m free, of which he holds the mark in large pool (20.94).
On one of the two quiet distances of swimming, the 50 m free, it was the 28-year-old Frenchman who won in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet was ahead of Croat Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world mark (20.30) as he had envisioned.
You can always dream better, and in this case, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane combinations, which will be banned from 1 January.
Originating at the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations complete their epic in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, in the same competition.
The use of the combinations did not serve the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the big pool this summer in Rome, world records at the end of the year.
The young swimmer failed to lower the mark he held on 400 m freestyle (3:32.77) but nevertheless won by making the second fastest time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danes Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't go into the middle of this race.
I knew I couldn't hit a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, explained Biedermann.
USA: a sarcophagus panel that belonged to zola awarded USD 1.5 million
A sign of Roman sarcophagus that belonged to the French writer Emile 'ola was awarded 1.5 million dollars on Thursday, well above his estimate, the art dealer Sotheby's announced.
This front panel two meters long by 63 cm high, dating from the 3rd century AD, was estimated to be between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "representing four dionysiac scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and bacchantes, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world", Florent Heintz, vice president of the art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold out of a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing, but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have bidder the most so far, Sotheby's spokesperson Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile zola dates back a few days.
The panel remained for nearly 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of her bathtub in his Parisian mansion, and at Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
There remained an area of shadow in his fifties.
Fliving the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this sign was part of an "Emile zola" succession opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Aborted departure attempt from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico considered on Thursday that the conditions were no longer in place for the transfer to its territory of the deposed President of Honduras, Manuel zelaya, who was denied a safe conduct by the putschist government.
For the time being, after a telephone conversation overnight with President zelaya, there is every indication that the possibilities for the transfer are not being realized, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to bring Mr. The Mexican Government's plane returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
The putschist government wanted to force Mr. He was to "resign" and to apply for political asylum abroad in order to grant him a safe conduct.
But the defunct president refused, because he wanted to travel to Mexico as the guest-time head of state.
The putschist government "has again failed in wanting me to give up my office (...), they wanted me to resign", said on Thursday Mr. Globo Radio, on which he has been speaking often since the beginning of the political crisis that has been going on for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing a few chords the deposed president, who has been taking refuge at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican Embassy has submitted a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, the Minister of the Interior of the putschist government, Oscar Raul Matute, told the Honduran Radio HRN on Wednesday.
I am not seeking asylum from any country, Manuel zelaya replied in an interview with the Telesur channel, which is headquartered in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to take place as President of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Mr. On Wednesday, he mobilized supporters of the deposed president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military strengthened their headquarters.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the putschist government.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he said.
The Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, Mr. Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on 28 June, the day he had held a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the military and the Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he had come back by surprise on 21 September and took refuge at the Brazilian Embassy.
If he goes out, he will be arrested for the crime of "high treason" which the judiciary accuses him, according to the putschist government.
The putschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr. zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted overwhelmingly against Mr. He will be in power until the end of his term on 27 January.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with US trade figures reflecting the recovery of both the US and its partners: the Dow Jones rose by 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The extended Standard and Poor's 500 index was awarded 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
We have good news from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But it remains anecdotal, she tempered, believing that the market was focusing on "half-solid glass".
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on US trade figures, "which shows that activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The US trade deficit declined by 7.6 per cent in October compared to September, to USD 32.9 billion.
On the other hand, analysts expected the deficit to rise.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, especially for goods exports, that reflects the growth of the economies of the major trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new unemployment registrations in the United States increased against the odds last week, reaching 474,000 applications.
But over the last four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to the lowest in a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has declined.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bill rose to 3.482 per cent from 3.42 per cent on Tuesday evening and the yield of the 30-year-old good at 4.492 per cent compared with 4.40 per cent the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of Proponents of Power Believe the "Lady in White"
A few hundred Cuban supporters of the Cuban authorities shocked on Thursday wives of political detainees gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were arrested.
About 40 "Dames en blanche", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were conquered in the street by supporters of the government of Raul Castro while they were marching towards the centre of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, an AFP journalist noted.
Down with the Yankees, "mercenaries", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries", "Vive Fidel and Raul" chanted, with their fists raised, supporters of power to dissidents.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes agents who came to "ensure their protection".
The previous day, a similar demonstration had been held against the "Lady in White" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havanese district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for International Human Rights Day were arrested by plainclothes police officers, an AFP journalist.
The police forcefully raided dissidents who were condoned by government supporters, according to the journalist, forcefully mounted in civilian vehicles.
Dissidents'ays in similar circumstances generally last only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 European Parliament's Sakharov Prize, the 'Lades en Blanc' had organised an unauthorised march to 'demand for the release of all political prisoners', according to dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain in prison.
The Cuban authorities regard opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the pay of their declared enemy, the United States.
Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of pro-government activists against "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European and American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including expression.
Forced man kills an octtogenous knife and injured 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
A force born of two knives killed an octogenarian and injured five other people in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Ugencies-de-Seine), at an hour's peak on Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the initial elements of the investigation, the assailant, aged 28, struck with two knives and for unknown reasons, an octogenarian, in or in front of a pharmacy on 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, police sources and witnesses were told.
Seriously wounded, the old man, born in 1929 according to an officer of the police union Alliance, died in hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then attacked a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, who was in his thirties, interposed himself and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenarian died.
The other person's injured days are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then became uneasy and was reportedly hospitalized "in a state of shock", according to a police source.
The armed man, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, still boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He reportedly injured two passers-by, apparently at random: a thirty-year-old and one four-year-old, the latter seriously.
The script remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he wore as a cross behind his back, explained an officer of the Alliance union in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several bystanders, including young people, according to testimonies collected by AFP, tried to control the force.
I saw a guy in about 30 years with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was tough, said Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Also Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the same time as No. 61, two municipal policemen, including their official, tried to arrest the armed man and were wounded with punching, according to police sources.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passers-by came to tell me that there was an injured person outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put her in a safe position, and I saw a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person in his thirties arrived, injured with a knife.
The man was arrested by the national police who had no identity documents.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office seized the investigation of the departmental judicial police service of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The force was hospitalized on Thursday evening.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source did not rule out the prohibition of his detention in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to subdue him to the police station in Clichy, where he was taken.
It was "in a state of over-excitement" as "all the forceful of this species whose forces multiply under the effect of the action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer calls for further dismissal
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again asked on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western USA), to drop the lawsuit against his client, who is currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a case of more than 30 years old.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the "Pianist" director, denounced serious procedural errors at the time of the 1977 case before three judges of the Court of Appeal in the Second District of California.
I call for the charges to be dropped here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has since died -- reportedly discussed, before sentencing, a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which is a serious procedural error.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "menti" to the author of the documentary.
Should the court refuse to drop the charges, Mr. Hummel requested a trial, which would enable him to present evidence of his case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed at first instance, namely that no relinquishment of charges could be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker had fled the United States in 1978, prior to sentencing, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old girl.
He has never set foot in the United States since.
Los Angeles County Deputy Attorney Phyllis Asayama stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to appear at the hearing".
In this case, is it intended to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to run away?, Mrs Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker "requests the court a favour, while despising its authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also pointed out "there are other alternatives to flight".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one who asked to drop the charges against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also called for an end to the prosecution.
Recalling that her client no longer bears to be harassed at every turnaround in the Polanski case, she added: 'No one in this room can say that the procedure was right.
Thirty-two years is enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on his United States arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, held back by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended up without direction on Friday, in a market torch between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the dollar hike: the Dow Jones rose by 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technology-dominated Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard and Poor's 500 increased by 0.37 per cent (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, noted Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains narrow in margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "contributed to improving market opinion on the robustness of economic recovery", Sampros' analysts summed up.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and much more than expected.
In addition, US consumer confidence recovered significantly in December, to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
The indices have, however, been held back by a new increase in the dollar, at the highest in two months against the euro, which "pushes down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation", explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
As a result, technological stocks have lost ground.
The bond market has declined.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bill rose to 3.5450% from 3.482 per cent on Wednesday evening and the 30-year bond yield to 4.497% compared to 4.492 per cent the day before.
Miss World Election Again in South Africa
After a month of travel across South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are poised to cross the final straight on Saturday to realize their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
In this great beauty mass held for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their tickets for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sports or Miss top model during their African stay.
It has been a veritable vortex.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was amazing.
I've seen a lot and had so many experiences," exclaimed Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 5 p.m. (15:00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to put my crown back on.
This experience has been fascinating.
I'm happy to have experienced it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "sweeting landscapes in that country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press encounters and safari, the Miss now focus on the competition.
The Infanta Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and present at the election, as well as Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became Bollywood stars.
It is every woman's dream to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, launch Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional suits and of course in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by a TV presenter, Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World Committee leader Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is hard to match, says Julia Morley, President of Miss World.
The candidates have as last year made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
Unusually, they also met with South African President Jacob zuma, who shook hands with them.
Not common for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their best memory will undoubtedly remain the draw in Cape Town (south-west) for the World Cup of June 2010, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've been to people I never thought I could approach.
I will definitely come back for the 2010 World Cup, enthusiasts Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news "is very positive", according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "is very positive", his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport where he was to go to his father's bedside hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong, it's going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he came out of the plane that was taking him from Paris shortly after 13:00 local time (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, assured him that he was going to go "very fast" to the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles for a comfort, to prevent him from suffering and be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disc on 26 November in Paris.
The singer had to be re-operated in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to extensive injuries resulting from the intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where their daughter Jade is attending a school show, an AFP photographer.
The head of orthopaedic and traumatological surgery at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer violently questioned Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on 26 November at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, said Mr. Camus.
I have heard of a possible future judicial procedure, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus felt that Johnny Hallyday was "partating far too fast for Los Angeles, with permission from the Parisian surgeon".
I had this doctor online who assured me that there was no problem on this trip and it had stunned me, given that I myself had two disc hernies, he added.
Shortly on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "drainless, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic world.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was working at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to clear a bruise following a cerebral haemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulphurous reputation, repeatedly convicted by the courts, in medical liability cases, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Mr. Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of Order, who is "far from being advisable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He stated that the intervention had "perfectly gone" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not haemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a drain", he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have been going on since this summer, seems to be in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens, nd) as expected, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF association increases the tone and summons the New Centre to no longer use its acronym
The UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou's MoDem, reacted on Friday to the attempt at takeover by the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former Pardian Party, by putting him in a notice to stop using it in any medium, on pain of legal proceedings.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after reaching out to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy before the NC National Council on Saturday.
In support of his approach, he received the support of the deputy Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP passed to the NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand for having been the first to deposit it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday evening, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to be dispossessed, came out of its silence to launch a formal notice for the minister and the deputy, calling them no longer to use it the acronym and to transmit to them the ownership of the brand, on pain of legal proceedings.
In recent days, you have multiplied the statements that you are going to propose to your political movement to "take back" the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it appropriate to forward the name of this movement, the "New Centre" on your website and on the watch page of your website, the "New Centre", of the slogan "the UDF of today", also note the signatories of the mail.
As you are aware, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the UDF office which calls on the NC to withdraw 'immediately the mention of the name of the UDF of any medium as well as its website'.
He also asked Hervé de Charette to "transmit the ownership of (the) mark to his legitimate rightholders".
If you did not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of the UDF members, the signatories would warn.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "is a political movement in its own right since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "choose" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002 to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the UDF (Union pour la démocratie française) acronym UDF.
They also point out that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and to set up an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
Hervé de Charette continues the office, "when he registered the trade mark", he had not been "another member of the UDF for three years", but at the UMP.
He proceeds scandalously and fraudulently from the abscence of depositing the UDF acronym to make it on his behalf.
This indelicateness is being turned into a crime, they denounce, before ironising on the NC's strategy: 'It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for oneself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled'.
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier to be tried for abuse of weakness
The Nanterre court decided on Friday to try the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenarian to rob her of part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photographs, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, with a maximum penalty of three years' imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a trial in this saga-worthy case on one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear themselves apart while holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87, should be conducted collegially by three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, at least not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office at the time of the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will have to submit a report by 10 March 2010, saying in particular that Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a weak state and at what times.
I think it will submit to it.
I'm going to talk to him about it, said at the end of the hearing Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Mr. Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...) The expertise will demonstrate that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated the elderly lady who must be protected, he said.
For the past two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has brought criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and a touch-to-everything artist, whom she accuses of having for years taken advantage of her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or masterboards.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refuted having been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers to be a long-time friend.
While the court had to consider the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers'action, lawyers'cotdicators sometimes turned to the family's debauchery on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer referred to three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was wary of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "could you explain to my daughter whom I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to her since her marriage."
For its part, the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office reiterated that the complainant was not entitled to take action, especially since a guardianship judge had refused in recent days to grant her request to open judicial protection proceedings for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to take legal action, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place", said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would rule once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Manage revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies vis-à-vis its employees, recalls the position of companies vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of getting employees to adhere to “values” determined from above as they used to be, to impose on consumers products designed by the factory’s technicians.
Putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquering markets to the place ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from the factors of customer preferences comes back regularly.
Demobilisation of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects managers.
This demobilisation seriously jeopardises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, in particular of research and development and, even more so, of economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI “requires a proactive approach and a forward-looking approach” from all stakeholders; it requires a commitment on the part of employees that authoritarian management revenues totally constrain.
That is why we are calling for a managerial revolution to put employees at the centre of the company’s concerns on the same basis as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – encourage this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I fear not.
First of all, because I have seen that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally arrives, after many detours, to do as a matter of priority ... which it has always done. - -
- Secondly, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – is growing in proportion to the magnitude of one’s own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Coming from the great engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, out of intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by US “neurosciences” and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by research institutes and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to manipulate the “levers” (sic) of executive engagement, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr, it strengthens leaders in a posture of mechanistic governance, unsuites to today’s world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises requires a finalist view of human behaviour.
It consists in incorporating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, the commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears to be a means of realizing part of their dreams, their ambitions and their projects.
Currently, only studies from the Patternation Analysis adopt this view of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their company on the basis of a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them in order to carry out their life plans.
By identifying and measuring these mobilisation factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resources management back "on the right".
They thus create a fertile ground for the concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: "Just War" is worth Obama's right-wing praise
The American right welcomed Barack Obama’s speech the day before in Oslo on Friday, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate defended the concept of “just war” against US enemies.
The Conservatives, who had broctated the award of the prize to Mr. Obama on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as was Sarah Palin, a former vice-presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party, in the USA Today newspaper, adding that she herself addressed the issue of the "sometimes necessary" war in her recently published memoirs.
War is, of course, the last thing in my opinion that the Americans want to have to do, but it is necessary.
These terrorists must be arrested there, she said.
Mr. Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, asked in Oslo on Thursday to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "very good work in Oslo."
I found the speech to be really good," said the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
On some sides, I have found this very historic speech, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, considered by some to be a possible candidate for the 2012 presidential election, expressed a plenum for seeing "a left-wing president" reminding members of the Nobel Committee that they would not be free and would not be able to award a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush converted to Washington Post, M. Obama made "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as a 'citizen of the world' as 'he always does', 'he spoke like an American president', reminding Europeans "that they live in a safety bubble that they have not created and do little to preserve it", said Mr. Gerson.
Among the few not-to-be-convinced right-wing, a Bush-era falcon, former UN Ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as "terne, apoggreous and uninspired" on the National Review Online.
To the president’s left, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich has alarmed Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When war is enveloped in the notion of justice, one can easily justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
The center-left press, however, remained a laudatory to the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called his speech a "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", the Californian daily has ignited.
Mr. Obama "promoted the right speech," The New York Times said, judging it "both gloomy and edifying."
Roads: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiations, the road trade unions and TLF, the only employers' organisation that had stayed to the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ends the strike order and the threat to Christmas supplies.
At the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, rejoiced in this agreement, after several negotiating sessions, which began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators had left in the early morning of Friday, hoping to sign the agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
And even though three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it took still more than six hours of a meeting started at 11 a.m. to get everyone in agreement and the text signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict would have been "very damaging to business" and "it was to be feared that it would disrupt the end-of-year holidays", said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In hourly rates, for low-wage waxes, "we go from EUR 8.72 to 9.06.
It's not much, but we're starting from a lot, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
It is to be ordering our activists that there are no blockades, no blockades of supply centres.
But you can still have a few recalcitranters that are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good deal", although it was "difficult to concede the increases on high salaries in view of the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of EUR 170 per month for low-wage earners and from EUR 100 to 120 for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke of "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of travel costs by 3%, and the holding of general road transport conditions in the first half of 2010, which will make it possible in particular to address the issue of a 13th month and to modernise the collective agreement.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "a EUR 100 million drop in employers' charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending finance law for 2009, which was voted on the night of Thursday and Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "in the same term".
The signature of TLF allows the agreement to apply initially to enterprises that are members of this organisation, and secondly, to the whole profession, in the event of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be "as soon as possible", said Mr. Bussereau.
Opposition of employers' organisations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "dep markets", as the EUR 100 million "has already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate urgently, not at the end of a shared analysis, but in order not to upset the turkey eaters on the next New Year's Eve,” said Unostra.
For the Otre, the agreement risks "depriving the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: Disruptions this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The disruptions to the RER A, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue over the weekend, while a meeting on Friday on the second day of strike between trade unions and RATP management left them hungry for their demand for a premium.
On Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of purchases before Christmas, there will be trains only between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., with one train in two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train out of four outside the central section.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Préfecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, which waited for 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is making efforts to serve department stores".
The RER A crosses from west to east in the Paris metropolitan area.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one train in two runs during peak hours, and almost no train in off-peak hours, as planned.
As on Thursday, there was no hustle and bustle on the quays, as the Francilians organized themselves.
Thus, in the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequented than usual, notably because of the absence of middle and high school students.
At Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had got up "one hour 30 earlier, to be sure to arrive on time".
St. Lazare station did not have saturation, according to SNCF, which had provided for a supervision of law enforcement officials and forces.
RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left from Gare Saint-Lazare to reach the subways.
New general strikers' assemblies will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will discuss the results, judged to be "lean" by the trade unions, of a meeting with the management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, working time, career development, etc.
This is not what drivers want, who are demanding a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
RATP even puts its proposals for precedence in parentheses, indignant the CGT, pointing out that the management "was not going to solve a problem while among lorry drivers and the SNCF is done".
A further meeting is scheduled for Monday to "a broader examination of the conditions for the practice of the profession", RATP said.
This also made the trade unions say that the company "makes mocking weekend users".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a settlement committee at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the management, which had hitherto refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested the meeting "with a concern for appeasement".
The conflict threatens to enlarge to RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and Independents was given notice.
The trade unions are asking for a bonus of EUR 120 (Unsa) to EUR 150, of which EUR 30 varies (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain of the deterioration of working conditions on this line per million passengers on a daily basis.
RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, receive between EUR 2,200 and EUR 600 to EUR 650 gross for staggered hours on Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves pro-Kurdish party, a decision with far-reaching consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday declared the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by anger demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision risks greatly complicating the task of the government, which has just extended its hand to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was disbanded because it had become a "home of activities prejudicial to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", Court President Hasim Kiliç told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to declare dissolution, said Mr. Kiliç, adding that 37 of the party's executives, including its president Ahmet Tork and MP Aysel Tugluk, were banned from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the waiver of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Turk and Ms. Tugluk and the Treasury's confiscation of party property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obedience to the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party claimed, however, that it had "no organic ties" with the PKK but refused to call it a terrorist organization and called on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict comes at a time when the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, in an attempt to tarnish the support of the Kurds in the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
DTP leaders had claimed that a dissolution could lead to an increase in tension in the south-east of anatolian, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan have degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the justice system, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large city in the south-east, mostly with Kurds.
Law enforcement officials fired tear gas cannons and water cannons, as demonstrators threw molotov cocktails or stones with slingshots.
About 100 people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Tork claimed that the Justice decision would "deepen despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by an Islamist movement party, also lamented the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedoing of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
A reaction from the PKK can, of course, be expected, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snows can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very harsh winter.
But the head of the Road Clearing and Sandling Service (FES) makes it clear that this is not to annoy citizens.
It's just so that agents can test vehicle technology and learn how to master them well.
And according to the meterologists, it may well be for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles stand ready to attack snow and ice.
The FES is currently following a very elaborate plan.
Mr. Brauburger explains that as soon as it rushes to the city of Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero, large sandblasting vehicles travel 20 main routes (called A routes).
This includes high-traffic streets, main arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstrasse.
Also included are fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as the Atzelbergstrasse.
FES officers begin their service at 3 a.m.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road area must be salted with a road wall which adheres well, within a maximum of 3 hours of time.
This is why the FES service starts at 3 a.m. "so that roads will be cleared when traffic in daily migration begins".
Where it gets harder, it's when the snow starts to fall at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, says the head of the road clearing and sandblasting service 'for no motorist is willing to let the salting vehicles through'.
Then, if it is no longer snowing, you take care of access roads and service roads - such as the Rat-Beil Straia.
Secondary tracks and side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger knows well that this always gives rise to a few complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES hiking team set out to identify as a matter of priority the areas deemed to be dangerous and the crossings.
As for cycle lanes, the services of the ESF generally cannot afford them.
Mr. Brauburger states that there is a special service in Frankfurt which is responsible for monitoring the condition of the bridges between 22 hours and 4.30 a.m.
As ice forms very rapidly on these surfaces, the salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
The police may also use this special service in need.
The cradle of dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae resembled the other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 2 meters long for 1.50 meters high, its hind limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was provided with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended in sickle claws and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing exceptional.
But, as reported by Sertling Nesbitt from the University of Texas to Austin and his colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine, the Tawa Hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which was part of the land of the supercontinent's land, Pangaea, and was to the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of Tawa sheds new light on the evolution of early dinosaurs.
Indeed, it tells us about the relationship between relationships, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
In 2006, Sertling Nesbitt undertook excavations with other paleontologists, at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Natural History Museum and member of the excavation team says that sometimes they sometimes found a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary dating from the Triassic.
Scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations uncovered the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories about the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
The researchers named it after the word of the Indians Hopi for the god of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is a very exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Triassicure are extremely rare and are limited to a few incomplete bone fragments.
Not all experts in paleontology share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn did not find that the discovery was particularly spectacular, but he pointed out that it could confirm certain theories concerning the early evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the older fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the very first dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, when saurians have divided into three major evolutionary groups: the theropods (carnivores) that include the tyrannosaur and the velociraptor that appeared later and from which birds descend, sauropods, long-necked quadrupeds, and related herbizos and herbivores ornithischiens of which species such as species such as the species are part.
Based on studies by S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa was one of the first theropods.
This species has an interesting ratio of both primitive and developed characteristics, called S. Nesbitt.
Researchers found evidence that Tawa hallae possesses small aerial sacs in its skull bones, as are birds that are descendants of the theropods.
These small air pockets facilitate the breathing of birds compared to mammals.
It appears that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small aerial bags in its bones.
As the related line between the immense sauropods also possessed air sacs and a light framework, it may be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most known primitive dinosaurs lived in South America, researchers concluded that saurians had appeared there.
Consequently, the three major evolutionary lines divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, i.e. all the landland that formed the supercontinent Pangaea.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to them.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor that would have migrated, the researchers argue.
Alan Turner of the Natural History Museum in New York and co-author of Science Studies magazine said that there had been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, paleontologist in Bonn, says there is an even older species, silesaure, which lived in present-day Poland and belongs to a dinosaur-related group.
According to him, this could give a mistaken view because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved, while virtually none are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how dinosaurs managed to become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era while they were from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, remains a mystery today.
In the Triacis era, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as with the ancestors of current crocodiles and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassies the dinosaurs spread throughout the world, thus promoting the development of many new species while others, which were related to them, disappeared between the Triassic and the Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs randomly survived while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or then dinosaurs were better suited and they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favourite meteorite'pouring of a group of animals which had also developed during the Triassic and which since that time had been vegetated in the shadows: they were mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are lecturers from the University of Naples, Quebec City, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin and Bremen.
The evacuation by the police of the casino from J.W. Frankfurt Goethe makes waves all over the world.
278 professors and professors from J.W. University. Goethe, but also other institutions of higher education in Germany, Europe and North and South America, expressed solidarity with Campus Westend's protesting students.
In a statement in German and English, they condemn the police intervention requested by the university's steering committee.
Last week, the President of Werner Muller-Estler University had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers on strike after walls and works of art had been smeared with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories consider that the deterioration did not justify "such violent intervention by the police commando against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation is an "unacceptable attack" on the freedom of research and education.
Focusing attention exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegitimize and criminalise protest" and attempts to make us forget the reasons for the mobilisation.
The Steering Committee of the University has thus shirked the discussions that would be indispensable.
The lecturers require that the criminal proceedings be instituted immediately.
The majority of occupants did not participate in the degradation.
Legitimization of protests
The young people of the trade union Verdi of the service sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) are showing solidarity with students.
Protests are only a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, Regional Secretary for Young People of the Verdi trade union.
As for the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse, Eva Kohne-Hurmann (CDU), she took the case for the action taken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and damage to the premises is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday during the television programme Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said the CDU Member of the Regional Parliament, Peter Beuth.
The opposition SPD parliamentary groups, the Greens and the Left (die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU uses a few painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of The Left Party (Linke)
Instead of thinking about the arguments and demands of students, they are being evacuated.
The Left Party has tabled a motion summons the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new Silicon-Vallley
For a long time she had a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
One of the ten districts of Moscow, under the Soviet regime, was a place for secret armament research, under strict surveillance.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 km from the center of Moscow, the commune has a reputation as the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Important production and research venues in micro- and nanoelectronics are located there.
As early as September 2008, representatives of the city created links with Riedberg, a place of French-style science – with the academic institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIz).
There were reciprocal meetings, and last Wednesday representatives of the city and Riedberg ratified a “Protocol of Close Collaboration”.
The signatories were Moscow Vice-Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz project leader for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FI-plus and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will be moving to zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will enable the companies of the company to enter the rapidly growing Russian market.
Russian scientific companies, on the other hand, want to obtain contracts in Germany.
It is home to famous Soviet institutes and research societies.
There is the Moscow Institute of Electrical Engineering, the major Sitronics and Rossijskaja-Elektronika.
The commune was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for weapons research.
The literal translation of the wooded hills in which the research centres are located is named after the wooded hills.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The size of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be high enough.
For its supporters it is nothing less than “new heart of Europe.”
If you like. S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the Baden-Wurttemberg capital into a desperate chaos of construction sites for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
Head-of-the-line stations, with tracks ending in the city, had the reputation at the time of being relics of 19th-century transport technology that were the shoe of the brake of modern rail traffic because it used to take a long time to move the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that is what we must do.
That is why head-of-the-line stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And also in Stuttgart: a train station, which is about halfway on the Trans-European Rail Magistral between Paris and Budapest/Bratium, hence the slogan 'Heart of Europe'.
The implementation of the S21 project is really going to begin, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality for a long time.
Even the most ambitious planners acknowledged that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, head-of-line stations no longer pose real problems of entry and exit since modern, reversible trains with railcars and pilot cars have been in place at both ends.
However, the construction of Stuttgart 21 is now launched next to the new route of the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and communal policies have prevailed.
The railway company is part of the party because it is the taxpayer who bears the risk of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public undertaking.
From an urbanistic point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – according to computer-generated planner graphs – will be very green.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The station and the section’s widening are designed for traffic of people to which – and typical of the 1980s – a huge growth was attributed.
At the time there was not yet competition from cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on increasing freight traffic, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly, concerns many other rail projects.
For example, EUR 6 billion will be swallowed up in the Swabia project.
That is the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be missed for other junctions and congestion in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport mentions a total of 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the expansion of the section through the Rhine valley by 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987 this line has been built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent to press the mushroom in depth here.
But the S21 project has the effect of a brake boost.
The Rhine Valley route is becoming the bottleneck of international freight traffic in the heart of Europe.
The Government is reviewing the airport ruling
At the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Land Government referred to the possibility of appealing to the judgement of the Hessian Administrative Tribunal concerning the ban on night flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had instructed the experts to examine from a legal point of view the judgement of the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document of more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations concerning the prohibition of night flights in the event that the planned construction of the north-western landfill runway at Frankfurt airport would be carried out.
The authorisation to desert for 17 aircraft between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the Land Government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against air nuisance at night.
The coalition must have decided by 4 January if it wishes to appeal in cassation against the judgement.
The opposition criticises this delay and tries to put pressure on the representative of the Government to announce the appeal to the Federal Administrative Court of Leipzig.
The leader of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schafer-Grombel called on the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections, which was to ban night flights. Otherwise, it will be condid as a total failure to speak.
It is damn difficult to be allowed to keep his word, Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the FDP's electoral slogan 'We are keeping our promises'.
Minister Dieter Posch refutes the reproaches of Schafer-Grombel, who claims that the Land government is still trying to allow night flights by using "avocasserie and rejoining".
It takes time to carry out a precise legal review.
The coalition does not want to take a decision on the basis of a "first quick impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Muller (FDP).
The opposition's interpretation of the statements in its faction on the ban on night flights is completely rusticing.
US banks repay the aid allocated
The big US banks, which are very much affected by the crisis, are unraveling their ties to the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully repaid the Treasury 45 billion dollars (over 30 billion euros), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp bailout.
The US television channel CNBC reported in a report that Citigroup was also considering reimbursement of the aid received.
Banking institutions are thus seeking to rid themselves of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of the sums, such as the limitation of the bonuses granted to managers as well as the settlement of higher costs.
The Bank of America launched a capital increase through the sale of securities to investors, which earned it 19 billion dollars of fresh money.
The rest of the sum comes from the bank's coffers which are well filled through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, the Managing Director of the Bank of America, was keen to thank American taxpayers: the capital injection helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capacity by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup also plans to obtain money from the financial markets in order to free itself from the guardianship of the State.
The US bank could launch a capital increase of USD 20 billion as early as Thursday, according to CNBC, citing banking circles.
The spokesman for Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
Eventually, everything happened faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the dismissal of the current holder of the post of reactor-in-Chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German channel, the successor has already been appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who runs the Berlin editorial office, was the big favorite.
However, the channel did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote so as not to anticipate the procedure.
However, there also appeared to be a desire not to further harm the steward of the Markus Schechter, in the event that the proposal was not accepted by the Management Board.
Frey, who was the candidate from Schacherter, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission out of 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schachter proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract by five years, but this was rejected.
Only seven members of the Council had expressed support for the reappointment of Brender and seven others had voted against. Brender's impeachment was a staggering failure, although predictable for Schachter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is in the majority of the Board of Directors, had already suggested several weeks before the vote, did not wish to reappoint Brender.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hessen, who had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to allow the contract for the highly esteemed Chief News Release to be extended on the grounds that the viewing rate of the news broadcasts of the company had decreased under Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, criticising the growing political influence on the zDF.
At the end, there were even 35 public law experts who had interfered in the debate and felt that Koch's way of doing so was unconstitutional.
But it will have served no purpose.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Rainland-Palatinate Radio Organization (Radio Organ) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German national daily).
In 1983 he became editor at the newspaper magazine "heute-journal" (modern of today).
From 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy of the editor-in-chief of the time; then correspondent in Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was chief and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (a bimonthly news program presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy department of the zdf and then head of the Berlin editorial office.
After Brender's disgrace, when he had just been elected journalist of the year by the specialized magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opponent on the Board of Directors, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palat Beck, said last week that the Federal States should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of the Federal Republic of Germany so that the steward's staff proposals could not be blocked by a one-sided political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of the political figures members of the DFS.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor, had skilfully maneuvered to the Board of Directors by criticizing the commission vehemently in his decision to dismiss Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schachter was able to propose it for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, just as the Board of Directors could elect it without the soupcon's position being placed a political supporter in the post.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as a liberal leftist.
Large-scale cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: After a year of an educational strike, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Lands decided to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Rectors' Conference, an agreement was reached stipulating that the working conditions of Bachelor's or Masters students needed to be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the burden of the examinations: a single examination should be closed at the chosen study module.
Moreover, the workload will have to be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and institutions of higher education wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Lands have also undertaken to organise more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor's and Master's courses.
At regional level, there should be no different rules from one Land to another.
Fewer reviews
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Minister of Education of the Lands and the rectors of universities have constantly been in the buzzword: 'studiability'.
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of examinations: "Each module should normally be open with a single examination", reads a 30-page document on future conditions for admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, said that a significant reduction in the burden of examinations should allow for a significant reduction in slippages, which were significantly detrimental to studyability.
In addition, "studentability" should be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies in the future.
Both the modules and the background must be carefully examined to see if the feeling of choking that is sometimes felt in the choice of courses cannot be avoided.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest knowledge of RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and the necessary flexibility to enable and promote personal initiative".
The new rules will cover access to the new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory which are under the authority of the accreditation councils set up by the Lands.
In October, the Ministers for Education had exerted some pressure on the Lands to put pressure on the agencies so that the programmes were not too loaded and the examination regime was not too strict.
In some federal states, universities and special colleges have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate action.
Rhineland-Palatinate is the only Land to have given its consent to grant more resources to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorial programmes and strengthen the teaching guidance offices as well as the examination offices and the international relations department.
The Lands and universities provide for a budget of EUR 10 million.
In early 2010, the Government wished to table an amendment to Parliament on the Higher Education Institutions Act.
As a result, only one examination will have to be carried out to complete his studies.
The organisation of studies will have to be more flexible, and it is also necessary to be able to guarantee the recognition of the transcripts of other higher education institutions and access to the Master's degree must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studiability" of all university cycles had to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the issue of the conditions for study in the country.
The decisions were appreciated, but criticism was heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students has indicated that he would like the organisation of education policy to no longer take place in the future "behind the closed doors" of the ministers and rectors of universities.
No later than after the educational strike, students as affected persons should be able to speak out a little.
The future graduates of higher education have been supported by the President of the Rectors' Conference (HRK) Delegates Margret Wintermanteel: 'the experience of the students is very useful to us', she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Land Education Ministers with whom the HRK is working on a common reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW), decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. He claims the right and the possibility for each Bachelor graduating from enrolling in a Master's degree.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Governing Board, also asked that the Lands provide today's Bachelor students, that tomorrow there will be enough places for Master's degree studies and the best possible educational conditions.
The Lands must therefore hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of reducing access to the Master's degree.
More than a footnote to Herta Muller
It is with these words “Arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control ...” that a work by the poet Werner Sollner, in which he thematizes in fragments of disturbing phrases, the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany who has gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Sollner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and, subsequently, collector director at a publishing house for young people before moving to Frankfurt on the Main.
He received various literary prizes; in 1993 he held the coveted chair of poetry at the Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hessen Literature Forum at the artist's house in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He talked a lot about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorted mirror of your Securitate files".
Visibly destabilised and embarrassed, he made a statement in which he recognized before his fellow German-Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, whom he had collaborated as an informant for the Securitate political police.
In 1989, the German language prize was awarded the German language in conjunction with some of the participants.
The enrollment trials had begun insidiously in 1971.
"So someone who hasn't been able enough to resist the bombings of the Securitate."
The poet Werner Soller is the writer Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honour of the Nobel Prize for Herta Muller and his exemplary literary entanglements with the power mechanisms of dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abyss and the lowness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Sollner is, as much as it can be said, not only guilty but also victimized.
In his own case Securitate, IM Walter played a role, assures literary scholar Michael Markel after the confession of Sollner and refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favour.
“He was able to draw it from all the difficult situations at the time,” according to Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Sollner made his statement and in front of this audience was unexpected, but the confession of a former dissident in his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the Securitate spies had already written Herta Muller in July in the newspaper Die 'Eit, after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It can be assumed that the victims will have made speculation and will sometimes have guessed which real names were hiding the borrowed names Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike Germany, where, in the meantime, the consultation of the Stasi’s files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate’s files is still very confusing.
A systematic clarification has been repeatedly thwarted and slowed down in previous years.
It was not until 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler Institution was created to work on the assimilation of the archives of the Securitate (CNSAS), but the return of files has tended to have dragged on since then.
Since 2005, there has been a law defining the management of archives.
The influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great is confirmed by the interview with a former head of the Temesvar Securitate who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize award to Herta Muller, expressed very disdainfully with the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she had been interrogated only once.
The infamy of power thought it could be expressed here, without any gene, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Admittedly, many inescapable questions are associated with the case of Sollner, as happens so often in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who was robbed? The balanced reaction of the auditors, to the admission of Sollner, gives reason to hope that the rest of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Muller, who was awarded the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Tumultars to the Champions League
One had the impression that a representative was coming there, pulled four pins straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports manufacturer had spread his goods when the new VFB trainer Christian Gross climbed at midnight minus a quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier in his hand.
The man, whose bald skull attracted attention, let himself be led into the city which was still foreign to him.
Otherwise, our 50-year-old could have driven himself – he hadn’t drunk alcohol, nor was he drunk at happiness.
He had had a pleasant evening, but tomorrow we had to go back to work.
Because it's now that it was going to start.
The Swiss words that had just been hired three days earlier were clear: “We have reached the eighth final”, that is to say in the league of champions thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania” but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight so as not to fall back."
"Light work" awaits us on Sunday.
Here, it is a question of repeating in Mainz the results of the champions league on a daily basis.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that resurfaced after the three quick goals of Marica (5.), Tresch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Drawing of lots
The eighth final of the Champions League (tour match 16./17. 23./24 February/feed match 9./10. 16./17. March) will be drawn by lot on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of the fulminant position of Babbel's successor was thus moderate.
And joy was not moderate only in the one who had brought luck, who had passed on to the destabilised Stuttgart professionals, unfailing motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and I told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I advised them to be braver, explained the 'plumber of souls' – Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so well but no longer had an effect with the Babbel's cure.
He unleashed a certain magic, confessed Jens Lehmann - Babbel's supporter - "in football when there is a new impulse there are sometimes things that one would never have thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of hiatus for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player with his dynamism, tried to describe the “phenomenon” observed by a “fresh wind” proverbial and the new leader’s method of work: “It is someone who takes action and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet reached the cap, warned manager Horst Heldt
At the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs tenacity.
Like Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having a bad awakening in Leverkusen four days later with the 0:4, objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, pointed out that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that they had others there that were still a long way off.
We have not yet taken the difficult course.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday doesn't have the heart to party, even after the first home win in three months, is due to the weekend events that a TV interview of goalkeeper Jens Lehmann rebounded just before the game started.
There are decisions that others make, not Jens, contradict Heldt, in response to Lehmann’s acerbic criticism.
He had accused the leadership of weak style and said that she had decided to change coaches under pressure from pubertal fans.
Lehmann had also considered it a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousale meant that his day off after the matches had been suppressed.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness" in contrast, and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were no longer likely to become friends for life with these two 40-year-olds.
In all cas, they agreed for everything else, i.e. without the previous work of the group by the replaced coach, the strong sports and combative performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "to a large extent in success" retorted Heldt and Lehmann in chorus – and even the man with a plastic bag acquiesced.
World Heavyweight Championship
Hot fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson challenged the challenger constantly verbally and gestestantly provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds, the Ukrainian defended his title as World Heavyweight Champion after the WBC Federation version.
Unanimously, he imposed himself on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title of world heavyweight champion.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion won a single-minimum victory for the judges against American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko has been honored with honor his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, Ukrainian had already won the World Championship of the WBO and WBC Federation twice.
Unfortunately, he did not pass the long-awaited KO.
Klitschko, won 39 times in 41 professional fights, had to confess twice his defeat due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Berne Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the large Klitschko wanted above all to dictate the fight, from the top of its 2.02 meters, by its left-hand counterpart.
Johnson, eleven smaller centimetres who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the champion's blows, thus preventing Klitschko from bringing into play his angelous right against.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures his blows only very rarely reached the champion.
He was the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having passed the distance of the twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko calling him a "bad zombie" who "is not really capable".
During the weighing on Friday, the champion could not help provoking Johnson by dropping his sunglasses from his nose “to see his eyes.”
Fourth win since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko won again in his fourth fight since his comeback on 11 October 2008
After a break of almost four years, he defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had previously abandoned without a fight.
This year, defending his championship title, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the United States.
“I just took a hit in this fight and I'm in perfect shape,” said Klitschko to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to reunite the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it was the British David Haye who, having deceived the great Nikolai Walujew – 2.13 meters – in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko, which was scheduled to take place in September.
It seems that his promotion company is considering playing this match now at the Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal opposition attack: the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jurgen Trittin, accused Defence Minister Guttenberg of a lie in the case of the Kunduz case.
The SPD and La Gauche (die Linke) parties asked the Chancellor for an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest intelligence on the Kunduz air attack, the opposition accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately accumulating certain facts.
The Minister intentionally 'formulated a falsehood' on the deadly strike of two tanker trucks last September, said the head of the Greens' parliamentary group, Jurgen Trittin, on Saturday during the news broadcast of the ARD 'Tagesschau' (the 20h newspaper).
Put simply, this means that he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in essence, the content of the report available to NATO, which was read by Mr. Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the lacquer’s goal was in fact not to destroy stolen trucks, but was to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured in the United States air attack, which was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left on Saturday called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to vote in the Federal Parliament as soon as possible and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Joergen Trittin and her Green Party colleague Renate Konast are of the opinion that Mrs Angela Merkel should make it clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Federal Government’s Afghan policy if the military, army and intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejected such criticism.
The Chancery did not in any way influence the army's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were growing voices to express doubts about the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as had been presented by the Ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had given to Guttenberg concerning the attack on tanker trucks was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and concealed from the Minister certain inconvenient details.
In the entourage of the two senior officials, however, it is suggested that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had meanwhile requested a clarification of the facts in a letter.
So far, it has not received a response.
On Saturday, the Ministry did not wish to comment on these accusations and referred to the Federal Parliament's commission of inquiry, which was to be formed the following Wednesday, in order to shed light on the facts in question.
The Worlds of Dreams
Some see, awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in the psychic patients, or under the effect of drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality merge.
As long as these phenomena manifest themselves during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our darkened rooms, we can indulge in unfettered dreams and fantasies.
However, he who, awake, experiences a dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being mad or drugged, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in psychic patients or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but sometimes prompting the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to melt.
A conscious awakening state, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, at the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and effect stand out, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the New Age Prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of shamans, psychoses, and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There is hallucination or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitting substances in the brain – first and foremost dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and achétylcholine – breaks and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts very often manifest themselves during schizophrenic psychosis.
The earth's force of attraction no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream-awakening; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
It's autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a comic book character.
Its body is in two dimensions with bright colors.
The earth's attraction no longer has power over it, it hangs over the ceiling.
He feels a blow.
Behind him of the winged devil creatures, grinding, with bloody mouths, showing the teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain all over his body.
Thundering, wicked voices scream, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer support those voices that insult him and humiliates him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of its stereo chain, in fact a loop and attaches it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs onto a baffle and passes the loop around his neck.
He jumps.
The loop becomes detached.
Let it be a lesson, shout the voices in a chorus to tear the eardrum out of it. "Go to a clinic and get treatment."
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years old, the first of almost 20.
It was triggered by the LSD.
Diagnosis: psychosis-affective, paranoid psychosis, in addition it is manic-depressive, it takes medicines against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in their life from schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, the people concerned can no longer tell the difference between the inner and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyper-excitation, which means that they may suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment, or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter out disruptive signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centred on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry at the Heidelberg University Hospital (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universit-tsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is at the center of the situation, all with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time it finds itself in a passive role, it is as in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general, they do not have the opportunity to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience once in your life a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved".
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, alienation of experience takes place in a real setting.
Why does our brain make this kind of cabriole, is always an enigma for researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everyone to momentarily lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that genes are not the only determinants.
Researchers assume that the people concerned have tiny brain damage.
It is assumed that neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example, by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what is still unexplained is the way in which the anomaly of the neural system occurs and, moreover, the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, if there is predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brains get hot.
What's crazy, psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lubeck says, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy very expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of perspective.
For the past ten years, Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and illusory image phenomena: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are indeed among the concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses but also of an impressive number of many other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising to note that under certain conditions even the brains of healthy people are subject to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions, are hyperactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brains heats up but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state just like brain injury or psychosis.
But also lack of stimulus, stress, heartbreaks, or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one third of participants admitted that they had experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Previous Phoristeria and she goes to high school.
A girl who really does normal.
If there were not images and voices.
During the recess, a young boy, thin, with long chestnut hair, sometimes speaks to him.
When she answers her classmates, look at her, astonished – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive her presence momentarily.
It's a pleasant feeling, she finds this young girlfriend.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes wonders.
But she knows well that this young person and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night, the appearances are, in general, frightening.
Often visions are heavy.
When she is in class, she sometimes cannot attend the class because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is visibly explaining equations on the table.
At night, the appearances are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for sleep that comes too rarely and far too late, she often cannot make a distinction if she is awake or dreams already, if the images she sees, grimacing faces or the girl with bloody cuts on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she yell at these creatures.
She doesn't tell her parents or her friends about it, they would take her for a crazy woman.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She had her baccalaureate last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago, hallucinations ceased.
Since she got into contact via the Internet with psychologist Kasten, she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or not has enough stimulation, there is a high probability that they will have hallucinations after a while.
I guess the brain wasn't busy enough, makes there be animation.
Sarah K., the only girl, was afraid of other children when she was little girl and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, whom the man she had called dad, since she was of a thought age, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real prints and noises, so it's very difficult for people like Sarah K to tell the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience," according to Kasten "takes place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, nocturnal dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally distinguished from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
This is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our world that is too focused on consciousness, we unfortunately quickly tend to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and head doctor of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Dusseldorf.
Psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also contains something positive, a creator – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oniroid form of experience, a particular form of the modification of consciousness awakened by the dream.
Oniroid experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is in a state of awakening.
Oniroid consciousness occurs during trauma or in situations of extreme conditions such as patients with polyradicularopathy who are fully aware of motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that undermines his life, by his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between dreaming and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of the world is taking place, but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in a situation which is intolerable in itself, an organisational capacity that is given to us, to us men, so as not to sink into the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in memories.
Peter Cornelius Classen, art historian also describes his or her ooiroid experiences in his book "Changing of Heart" as an action to safeguard the soul.
He is 49 years old, at a time when his conscience is leaving for a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain immobile in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world he created from scratch, visiting foreign places, traveling back in time. He sees himself as an old man in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside that monitors his health.
He lived in the Middle Ages among nobles who made blood-based narcotics.
He is kidnapped by a Greek motorcycle who takes him to his country, surfs with his hospital bed in the Alpine shroud and meets a Korean mobster.
He is completely absorbed into this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these internal journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is a completely different state, he writes, describing what it has experienced.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intensive than real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, the Oiroid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a state of vigil.
Any change in the state of consciousness, psychologist Kasten sums up "can cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experiment that can also be quite enriching.
The first snows can fall
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will take over from the publishing house.
Kallen's appointment as CEO of Burda Editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told the newspaper Spiegel.
The holding company must remain 100% of a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, publisher Hubert Burda sees his society in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at the age of 27 and are firmly committed to joining society, said Hubert Burda, 69, in Spiegel.
All details have been resolved in advance.
Whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
It will also be necessary to see if they are capable of doing so.
Children cannot be imposed on 7,500 employees without knowing whether they have the capacity to take care of them.
This would demolish both children and businesses.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he was withdrawing from the post of Chief Executive Officer in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
First of all, he was responsible for the technology sector.
Afterwards, he was in charge of the treasury sector, i.e. he was responsible for the company's capital, and after the departure of Jurgen Todenhorfer, he also took the lead in marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
Thus, for the first time it was not a member of the family who led the Burda editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, respectively, her son Felix, who is now 42, died a few years ago.
Kallen's name is also used to make the link of the next 10 or 15 years."
Burda points out that the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always occurred in families who have allowed themselves to be dragged along by a bulimia of capital, who have made enormous unfortunate speculations in the belief that they could climb ever higher.
That has never been my strategy.
I've never had a dream of universal power," said Burda.
I do not see myself in any way as the province's tutor as Springer could be, and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have become too important.
Full beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is the objective that seems to have set an El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the shopping centre of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary area of more than 1000 m2, devoted to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious signs such as Hedonai, specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis and Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food radius, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Among other things, Spaxion offers you to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or renting the relaxation area for two hours in order to organize your own “Beauty Party” with eight of your friends and relax through a jacuzzi session, massage while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, 250 m2 are divided into 12 rooms, where the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy can be provided.
Like, for example, cavitation to combat cellulite or vibrant platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual “trainers” who guide customers’ steps, offering them fully personalised treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to perform our exercise program correctly.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are enough to make all the body muscles work.
And if, after having our body worked, we want to go through the hairdressing salon, the Luis and Tachi brand has a room where we offer rituals of hair repair, lightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the watchwords of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Various off-colleges
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to fit our party wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the variables that we need to take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. This is not very much advised.
Endesa and Barcelona, equip itself with the electric car
The electric company Endesa, in collaboration with the Ayuntamiento in Barcelona, has created the "Oficina LIVE".
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "Oficina LIVE" will define and coordinate the roadmap for the installation of the electric car in the city and will put in place mobility agreements, by taking steps, coordinating, submitting subsidies, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, and gather the opinions and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 “Electric cities”
But Barcelona is not the only city involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
The electric company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
Its objective is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include activities related to energy, and in particular to energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative that Endesa is taking part in the promotion of the electric car.
The company is taking part in Europe-wide standardisation groups and has a set of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
"a future of tranquillity" for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodriguez, sees “a future of tranquillity” for the Spanish car industry, which, he recalled, is the country’s main export sector.
In presenting the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, he recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, we would now have a landscape of abandonment, closing some of our major production sites,” said the President of the Government.
“With this plan and the decision of brands to remain in Spain, in a highly competitive sector, we can envisage a future of tranquillity for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Industrial Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), had allocated EUR 800 million to the projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilised an investment of more than EUR 3 000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
He also highlighted government support measures on demand, alluding to Plan 2000E, set up in collaboration with the Autonomous Communities and Automotive Enterprises.
According to the President, the plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles on the Spanish market by 6 per cent and contributed to a “large increase” in registrations, which increased by “40 per cent” in November.
20,000 m2 of vintage cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Exhibition of Collector's Cars, a meeting place for professionals and enthusiasts of the engine world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Crystal Valley of the Casa de Campo de Madrid.
They have an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
It will not only be possible to find motorcycles and vintage cars, but also to ClassicAuto Madrid will also find items of all kinds related to the engine world.
Thus, at the exponents of the pavilion, we will be able to find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, complements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will delight collectors and curious people.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among others, Closicos de Mos and Good Old Times, specialists in car sales, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Cup-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restaurants, or Cochera Closicos, specialist of Mercedes Benz.
Outdoor aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this fair will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Vitus tests with cars and collector motorcycles will also take place on a circuit set up outside the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sport
Mazda wants to prove that the spirit of sport is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated on the Mazda3 the engine shut-off and start-up system, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for the time being, is only available on the 150-horsepower petrol 2.0 engine.
This second generation of Mazda3 stands out as well as the overall score it has.
The details, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system, etc.
All these aspects are remarkable about the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fastening.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the control panel and the console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Japanese Civic contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more particularly with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
Continuing with the passenger compartment, this compact Japanese car has more than sufficient habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Added to all this is a great trunk with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for the time being, is only available on the two-litre and 150-horsepower petrol engine and with a manual six-speed change.
This engine is a real bliss. It is exemplified by its finesse, low noise, performance and control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most in-demand Mazda3 are diesel models, those that do not make a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, i.e. the one with the largest number of standard elements.
Among the standard equipment, the Track Change Assistant (MRA) that removes the blind spot, traction and stability controls, cruise control, photosensitive indoor mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio, as well as the 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly notable.
In addition, as if this equipment were not sufficient, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional EUR 1,500, includes, among other elements, bi-xenon-adaptive headlights and a BOSE audio system with disc charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly distinguished by the quality of the materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make many kilometers per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the 150-horsepower 2.0 petrol engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between EUR 21,770 for the Luxury finish and EUR 23 270 for the model tested, the Sportive.
In return for this large sum, the Mazda3 will offer us a great dose of satisfaction every day.
Luxury “First”
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality incarnated by Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have dazzled us more than ever, dressed in models that are as stylish as they are sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our “Pé”, as sophisticated as it is accustomed, had opted for a dark “lady”.
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to look at his e-mail, without offering the possibility of even seeing some type of attachment or browsing the Internet.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine designated him as one of the products of the year.
The truth is that it is more difficult to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low monthly price and subscription, less than half of what it costs, for example, to the iPhone data subscription.
Given its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free life-long data service, six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American brother, but it is a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, around EUR 12, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or desperately searching for a cafeteria on the WiFi (or a connection from Fon) to be able to view their mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive, and it should have worked for a long time.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small print.
Repeated calls to the European Commission to propose affordable roaming tariffs across Europe have had barely perceptible effect.
Outside one’s country of origin, one hesitates to use the data, and one is not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon when it does not have WiFi) offers this type of fare, means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals that allow them to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, including downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No subscription and no galley.
It is a connected device and it is paid for when it is purchased and not every month.
And that is what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: a purchase option with lifetime access as Peek already offers it in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I believe that this is a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's Favorite Color
Yellow is, no doubt, the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
While she went to Barack Obama’s presidency of the United States with a dress and coat of that color, she chose the same to accompany her in the second moment, without a doubt, the most important of her life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to their resembling color, a yellow pulling towards green with bright reflections, both times, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabrics, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So at first glance, it would seem that the First Lady of the United States follows the trail of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to hand over the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If it was a thick lace to take office, on the other hand, it wore a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: medium-heel green shoes for the first opportunity, and a similar, but golden, model this time.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now raised while it was released the previous time.
75 per cent of working mothers had work problems because of their maternity
Discrimination in the workplace has increased in recent years, especially for younger women in the younger generation who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study “Fertility and professional career of women in Spain”, carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, carried out on 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers have had their professional careers limited because of maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the onset of couple living and the number of children, whether or not the woman is working and the type of job held.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time or have an unstable job, start a couple earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, postpone entry into life as a couple and first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after settling in a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 for those working in the public sector. “These data show that women in stable employment have needed more time in their lives to get it, leading them to postpone union and child arrival.
Moreover, the type of employment exerted largely influences maternity, but less the date of start of living together,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
Education is another factor that widens the age gap between women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child late.
The difference also persists among women in the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, those with elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average, respectively.
“Another discipline also appears between women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary education marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those with middle or higher education reverse this programme and give priority to obtaining stable work as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child,” says Delgado.
Diane Kruger also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will embody the image of several products of the brand, singing the universal motto “Because I am worth it”.
The protagonist of Joyeux Noel, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other celebrities registered with L’Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before she, the last to enter the club if select were actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
Among men, the cosmetics brand also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
British fashion prices
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His greatest representatives, creators and models of yesterday and today gathered for the annual award ceremony, which took place in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
Ace poker by Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographs" of writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
It does not do so according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical insurrection, life and work), but by seeking something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent spares neither frights nor the illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to reading and rereading.
I'll leave you here with a few snapshots.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the very one that I felt without naming it: pleasure against the evil destiny, morality without guilt and innocence without any god. ”
On Samuel Beckett: "Niphilist, an allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in blood, not in his head, between helplessness and ignorance, with a dazzling, meaningless poetic humor, like the blade of the knife that almost killed him. ”
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a thirteen-year-old passion, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery to the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege of reaching heaven by the path of perdition. ”
On James Joyce: "Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-metre peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed by the north face, on which the best climbers drop again and again. ”
On William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
By himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a landowner of the county and other times that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great. ”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the denice taken from a bridge by this character of Munch to bring his echo to the depths of the night of the 20th century, in its literary form, and he did so in the flight of himself and invoking the posteriority with a violent discourse to the maggots. ”
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she kedds and prayed, "Beloved God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman. ”
On Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were engraved the verses of Spenser: "Sleep after the effort,/ after the storm,/ the rest after the war,/ after life, the death is delighted. ”
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband very normally agreed that Edward VII was watching him between the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
Never before has a man so patient and in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent surpassed madness. ”
On Pao Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do but try to hide Joyce from Baroja?"
What did Faulkner try Benet if it wasn’t to shoot Baroja?
What if it was not to suck the glory of this man so that he could serve him as a pedestal? ”
Cowardly assault
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed by her and our dog, blood-milfooted, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they gave them two kicks left behind the dog.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see the amusing of an aidless little animal who was on the leash for free.
To this must be added the indignation of a lady who was walking quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energant attacking an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., on a Tuesday and another, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog wandered all day.
We have, of course, lodged a complaint at the police station, even though we doubt that this would be very useful and not to touch on sensitivities, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
Indigtion has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening in young people so that they find it funny to abuse a defenceless animal for free that gives us affection, friendship and company.
We do not know where the right education and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, helmet-wearing ensembles
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, mainly among the youngest motorcyclists, as both structures have indicated today.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing helmets, since it is the only element of protection that makes it possible to avoid head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeled accident.
Michelin said that the campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products" and said that it contributes to this objective through other educational and informational actions.
This new campaign to encourage the wearing of a two-wheeled helmet, under the motto “To be or not to be”, will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to guarantee the widest possible distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is increasing
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles began to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the employers’ trade union of the manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of dealers.
However, the good news should be qualified, since the benchmark for comparison in November 2008 was particularly bad, with a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite last month’s rebound, the registrations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if all vehicles in the category of light commercial vehicles (drifts, pick-ups, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) are added together) have been sold.
The big clouds that affect their most demand have not dissipated. Although they are also purchased by private individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions implied by the limitation of bank loans, there are other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In view of this situation and the difference between passenger vehicles, the 2000E purchase aids have been of little use.
In addition to private individuals, self-employed persons and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions which does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday at Ganvam, the need for the administration to pay special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (healights and buses) were again recalled.
The dealership association foresees a year 2010 similar to the one that ends, for which it calculates a fall in sales (of passenger and 4x4) sales of 19%.
Emergency brake assistance is now mandatory
As has taken place with the anti-lock system of ABS brakes and as will be done with the ESP stability control, emergency braking support systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already compulsory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of failure has been set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen pedestrian protection, although, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear impacts.
The emergency brake assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the driver's kick.
But the latter does not always keep up the pressure until the end.
According to a study by the car component manufacturer Bosch, one third of the drivers involved in an accident were unable to press the brakes before the collision, and half of them did not take advantage of its full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, which again will, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such components, up to 1 100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented every year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularization of so-called Intelligent Emergency Braking Systems: it is calculated that one in four disasters with the injured would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, by means of a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and prevents the driver, in addition to acting lightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps him by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts the maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimise damage.
General Motors pushes over the plan for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Sarzamasis) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva would be launched in the first week of April – probably on the 8th – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that he would need more time to conclude the rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, intends that each point of the plan has been approved beforehand by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, is postponed until early 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, it is said that a decision on the sale of Saab is expected to be taken in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has stepped up pressure on the US manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with possible new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to buy Volvo, but the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, supported by the Russian group Converg, is gaining ground.
In the event that there is no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
Driving the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and precious jewel, Porsche engineers left the Boxster S and managed to thin it from just 80 kilos, leaving the scales at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to dispense, first of all, from the automatic roof which was replaced by a manual sheeted roof, reducing by 21 kilos, using aluminium doors such as those of the GT3, another 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of gains, to ride sports buckets, and to ride sports buckets,
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, thus winning six more kilograms and replaced the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual clutch PDK gearbox, the test was performed on a six-speed manual gearbox model, mainly on roads in the secondary network of California, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
Its behaviour can only be described as irreproachable.
The reduction in weight does not prevent the car from driving on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary, it has been a long time since we tested such a small and light model that, at the same time, guarantees so much safety in corners, including at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles at low speed for as long as we ask him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again ...
That's what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is precise, the car will do as our hands on the wheel will indicate.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of his V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be enhanced with the "sport" option or by a system that alters the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is abrupt, either when stopped or when recovering.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The pavement of the roads we traveled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car handled the chicken nests well.
The electronic assistants barely took part in the whole journey, whereas on some turns we found ice in the early morning and gravel later in the morning.
Ultimately, an ultra-light car, which is more entertaining to drive and which is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be put up for sale in February 2010, at a price of EUR 70 831.
“Bag Girl”
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the parades of the house, the singer displays her face as bad girl with as much capacity as her Chanel bags.
More than a "Bad Girl" or an "It Girl" is a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia wins in Israel
Caja Laboral achieved a dramatic triumph at 91–82 during its visit to the arduous field of Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by Dusko Ivanovic’s team. She is thus at the top of her group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic, who, with eight three-point baskets, was the best of her team (29 of evaluation).
Vitoria's team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of commitment and collective work, although they had to wait until the end to win.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 three-point baskets scored, largely determined the final victory.
The match began quickly for the blues and red, which took the lead from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, heralded that they had jumped on the Israeli ground with warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main craftsmen of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was in the same tone, but the Alava team chose Barac's inner game and the work of Eliyahu, which was received with cheers and applause back to his old house, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to be noted as his team's best player, with 13 points scored, although Splitter's "under six" was already warning that that night was not going to be the Brazilian's best.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from it, and the Avala team wanted to remind Vitoria's team that we did not win so easily on their field, and thanks to "Elias's hand", they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the achievement of the yellows' advantage over the luminous (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, wounded but far from dead, needed to follow up some skillful actions to get the air, and it was at this point that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun arose, which, with three consecutive three-point baskets and the help of English and Ribas, gave the counter the counter to a reassuring score (54–67), and that the locals managed to accentuate the third quarter.
The Avala team went out to play for the whole time in the last period, and English and San Emeterio (60–75) advised that they would not tire anyone of them taking what they had earned for the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign themselves and tried to support her from the three-point line (70–77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for mistakes, Ivanovic’s players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis had approached in the last minute (80–85), the game was already played and victory was escaping from Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting battle
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to Olympiacos and gave it the head of Group B of Euroleague in a match marked by the absences of Unicaja players, especially in the inner game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), who facilitated Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or by the rival’s stature, arguably one of the most powerful in Europe with a large budget.
The first-quarter game made it possible to make the Andalusians dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive three-point baskets, two of leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18 in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with the inner game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, made it possible to reverse the score 22-20, at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of fighting, between North American leaders Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to operate by showing his superiority in both sides, while the injury release of the English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal faults weighed on the Unicaja.
The inner players and Lithuanian wingman Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, dug the advantage 44–32, in the nineteenth minute.
An impossible upturn
The third period was particularly offensive for Olympiacos which, despite the 19 losses, proved to be superior and even matched the difference between the match in Malaga 66–48, in the twenty-seventh minute, causing the group to stagger the group.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was wounded during the match.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook’s three-pointed baskets, and Lewis’s support, left some hope with 66–57 in the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was almost impossible because the Olympiacos was implacable when the players were pressing and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic managed to go back to 81–62 in the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja subsided, accepting the victory of Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid according to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know what salary they deserve based on their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of real estate, job and vehicle advertisements in Spain.
The “How many should you be paid?” tool calculates users’ salaries from more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you have to register your profession, years of experience, age and city where you want to work.
For the sake of the application, the search engine has detected that, as a rule, the Spanish worker “feels ill-paid,” Trovit’s product manager Albert Ribera said in a statement.
According to the data available to Trovità from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, Spaniards are the lowest paid.
A British computer programmer receives EUR 45,226 gross annually and a French one, 31 059, while a Spanish person receives EUR 24 000.
In the same way, a driver receives EUR 34 247 gross annually in England, 25 751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest-paid work in Spain is that of server, with EUR 11,592 net annual, followed by that of seller, with EUR 14,725, and that of worker, with EUR 15,667.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months have been driver, part-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for the departure from zelaya
The Brazilian Government has set a deadline for Manuel zelaya's stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The overthrown president must abandon the diplomatic legation no later than 27 January 2010, the date of the formal end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, a Chargé d’affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that “Mel” knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since 21 September, before that date.
“He is aware that he must leave on 27 January, at the end of his mandate, he must seek another destination.”
The channel also quoted the former representative, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the established deadline: “My position is to leave as quickly as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government,” zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), he assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually failed, as the zelaya refused the condition of political exile that the de facto government presided over by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After pink days since last spring, when asset inflation has been the dominant market rating, uncertainty arises again, which is not surprising, as it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future that is by nature uncertain.
The central bank’s remedy for stabilising markets has been to monetize debt through direct asset purchases and indirectly by providing abundant liquidity at near-zero rates, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been virtually finalised and, without questioning their non-conformist liquidity policy, are beginning to put some sand in the cogs, as the ECB did, with their one-year auction next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain an economic recovery without heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reverse in reducing risk premia.
Stock market volatility and trade interest spreads are rising again, although they remain far removed from the paranormal levels they reached earlier this year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is affected again.
There is again a flight to quality, and the US, Japan and Germany have been the investors’ chosen refuges, provoking an increase in the differences between eurozone countries and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard and Poor'sa threatened with a further downward revision of the Kingdom of Spain's qualification.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad for silenced those who were trying to provoke a case of conscience among the global economic policy officials who had held back the destructive effects of credit limitation on the destruction of employment, when what should be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the emirs to restore its place to power in the emirates, and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the rose pot.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Duro Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational if the Ecofin saved Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a eurozone member country not to meet its commitments.
What is logical, however, is that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek Government to make the Greek Government transparent and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, it would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt spreads increase to the extent of European corporate bonds, we do not have to worry.
If European differences were to fall and ours continued to rise, it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard and Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecast indicators force most student services to anticipate their stimulus models and revise their 2011 forecasts upwards, with the OECD and the European Commission, who are back with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, they do not augur much hope for their warning.
Again, it seems like an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the time being “precaution is a safe mother.”
Connected sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sanchez Galon, was the first to speak yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where Spain’s energy strategy for the next two decades is being discussed these days.
Following his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galon sketched out what he had mentioned to the eight-lane subcommission for the press.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 000 million until 2020 and EUR 60 000 more between that date and 2030, should nuclear power plants currently in operation remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to EUR 60 000 million but to EUR 95 000.
On the other hand, Iberdola believes that for the next decade investment should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue is changing, and power will have to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal-fired power plants, carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that an additional 18,000 MW is needed, along with other “supporting energies”.
Galon, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Law that the government has just approved is in line with what his company is calling for, did not want to attack the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there is “a clear long-term gamble” in this direction, despite the “one-off” measures, as the president of Iberdrola has called them.
In any case, Galon believes that decisions to invest, although they are long-term, must start to be taken, because they take some time to mature and that a stable gainful framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling market at ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, will act as the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, the economic terms of which have not been revealed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcala de Henares signed yesterday a protocol of collaboration to create the Centre for Innovation in Smart Infrastructures.
The alliance foresees an investment of EUR 20 million until 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to carry out research on energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes in its first highway in Australia to Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession highway in Australia, where it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The project is an estimated tunnel of ECU 1 700 million (approximately EUR 1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A five-kilometre-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and motorway concessionaire.
The city's town hall wishes to be able to do so by the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Erns and Young, the local government already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the toll site and the operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their offers next May, the planned investment amounts to AUD 1 700 million (approximately EUR 1,047 million) and in the last phase there are three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only smooth Spanish company, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The former is one of Australia’s largest builders, while the second, based in Italy, is one of Europe’s leading underground specialists.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium is being supported by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French manufacturer's group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium that passed the event was LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the stake of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger group) and the Welsh works company, Razel.
Australia’s infrastructure market promises major construction sites and privatizations, but entering it represents a great difficulty, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian credentials, which is still an unvalidated stage for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just gained a place in this market by its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Acciona is placing a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and runs the business combination to build and manage the Adelaide desalinator, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and to take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The tollway, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and Northern Link (northern connection), is intended to connect the Western Highway from Toowong to the peripheral road at Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest project in place to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the invitation to tender will take place in the summer of 2010 and that work will start in December next year.
Despite the fact that this toll lane will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the site will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will comprise twice two lanes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide EUR 500 million (EUR 308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make Hochtief much bearing, which yesterday mentioned a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national fibre-optic broadband network.
This intervention will provide 400 000 people with rapid Internet access and will provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company sold the 27-storey King George tower project in the city of Brisbane. The work has not yet started and Hochtief has concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for EUR 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, is subject to the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia, for a total of EUR 64.5 million.
The company obtained the contract a few days after considering the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates his experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the project is scheduled for the start of 2010 and its completion will take 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore is referred to Renfe's advertising
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the Sra agency. Rushmore, for a budget of around EUR 3 million per year, said the rail operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was chosen from 16 agencies that came to Renfe’s call for tenders, four of which were finalists, including TBWA, which has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the countryside.
A fine of 63 million at France Télécom to curb competition
The French competition regulator fined France Télécom a fine of EUR 63 million for its anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean region belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and loyalty programmes for consumers outside the scope of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still a state-owned monopoly has been accumulating more than EUR 450 million in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it places on its competitors.
Yesterday’s sanction was increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and is therefore recidivist.
An application shop
On the other hand, the mobile phone subsidiary of the French company has followed the wake of other operators and has opened an Internet application shop, with the aim of increasing the revenue that does not come from the transmission of votes.
Initially, the Orange app shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will be until 2010 that it arrives in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has earned 476.4 million in Real Madrid and Barça since its creation.
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its inception in 1992.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have earned 467.4 million, putting them in third and fifth place in the clubs that have pocketed the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not just about fame. It is also one of the main sources of income for large clubs.
Indeed, the competition has allocated EUR 5 362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third largest in the continent to receive the most money for its participation, and the only one, with the A.C. Milan, having won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, which ran the title and the last winner of the old European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also charged the most for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, although they lost in front of Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, in terms of the money brought by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for the distribution of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will spend 413 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification matches (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to 550 000 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus in the event of a victory (EUR 800 000) and a tie (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the round of 16 per cent each receive three million, the eight teams that arrive in the quarter-finals receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, against the 5.2 times the other finalist.
Thus, for fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are variable payments, to which 337.8 million are spent.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the largest, with four seats.
The previous year's champion occupies 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 61 million for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday listed the details of the share purchase offer by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos’s capital.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a takeover bid (takeovers) for all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.50525 per share, which will be disbursed in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this deferral.
Yesterday, Sos’s shares ended at 1.85 euros, so Nueva Rumasa’s bids 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects Sos’s actual valuation.
The offer is subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 members.
The Jerez group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of the securities.
The CNMV assured that it had not been informed of the offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it took place, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while Sos’s capital would amount to 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos is continuing to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay outside of possible offers of purchase and the judicial comes and expenses of her former directors, the brothers Jesas and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of Maria Luis Jord as internal audit director.
A decision that makes him the first woman to hold a leading position in the food business.
This is a newly created post which will directly depend on the group president.
And it is not free of controversy, as the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the supposed diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos may reveal further misappropriation of funds cannot be ruled out.
With regard to credit to the Salazar, former members Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernandez Noriega (representatives of the JCC and Unicaja) told the National Audience yesterday that they had been informed of the diversion of EUR 212 million without knowing its destination.
CNMV approves Paternina exclusion takeover bid by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday approved the exclusion takeover bid submitted by Inversora Mer to Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with the standards in force and that it considered “sufficient” the content of the explanatory sheet submitted, following the changes applied on 2 December.
The CNMV clarified that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, which represents 8.95 % of the share capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592 778 million shares had been immobilised and could in no way be transmitted before the final bid, which he stated that the price had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the standards in force.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are reduced to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage and the cost of repair.
Each claim is different, and the calculation of coin and labour time costs can be a long and complex job.
Calculating by hand the cost of a repair of between EUR 20 000 and EUR 30 000, including coins and labour, may take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the help of the latest IT tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
For this reason, almost 100 per cent of experts use such systems.
Service providers and solutions for claims assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers, and then processing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other competing companies in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velazquez, the commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
Moreover, the amount of data to be processed is constantly increasing, so that in the last five years more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous 15 years.
When a new car comes out on the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very difficult task, because it is necessary to catalogue each thousand parts of the vehicle and to register its price.
In addition, a “smart” graphical image of each model can be created on which the different parts of a passenger car can be clicked.
If it is a model sold on a massive scale, the work can be ready in a week if the process moves very quickly.
If it is a low-sold car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have information about the Porsche, but not the Ferraris or the Lamborghini.
For vehicles in use, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the documentation and database development work, Audatex has eight centres around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than 100 technicians (generally mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million annually to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information enables these companies to give them different uses and to offer a variety of products.
The most frequent application concerns repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing breaker parts or for calculating the market or residual value of a car.
The only company with a guide that provides information on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not propose it in our country, but it does so in the United States.
Given the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get a sense of what kind of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard solution for disaster assessment, for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint schedules.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is EUR 5.75, for customers who use it little, at most ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the complete identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lenses, and AudaSubastas is a professional server on the Internet that bids on vehicles declared wrecked.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geo-demographic analyses or knowing common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a specified brand went to the garage for a breakdown or how many serious disasters have suffered for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to developing such tools.
It markets, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the manufacturer’s official parts, prices and time.
Gt Motive is a company in the Einsa group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of claims, breakdowns or maintenance.
The GT Assessment Guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased at a rate of 20% per year over the last three years, and it has made a turnover of EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, it began its internationalisation process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established itself in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its turnover is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex AB, Hollander and IMS) will amount to USD 557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive EUR 19.1 million, or 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was publicly traded in the stock exchange of USD 1,000 million, and its shares are valued at a total of USD 2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard and Poor's benchmark.
Internet auctions of damaged cars
Last October, the Solera Group bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and disaster-stricken special vehicles.
The operation involved a cost of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The aim of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimation and sales service is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, breaks and professional sellers who must be registered before starting to carry out operations.
The platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500 000 in Germany.
Its main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 vendors and 4000 registered experts on the site.
It manages 3,000 advertisements per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new advertisements are published every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed may no longer circulate, but on the other hand, certain parts which are not damaged may be used as spare parts.
Collecting cars can be re-registered, even though they have been removed, after complex steps.
Garage quotation in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user obtains a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially in order to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are resistant to the use of new management techniques.
The database consists of 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passenger vehicles, 109 off-road, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, for use, a computer and an Internet connection are needed.
Once the model to be repaired has been identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary part is selected.
The user may include variables such as labour force price, mark-ups or discounts, and then he can print the quotation to hand it over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a catalogue of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include estimated labour times.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is EUR 350 per year, which can be credited.
Currently, Audatex is working to ensure that these images are in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see very positively, since it will make it possible, for example, to select a door and rotate it to see the inner face.
