At the end of the exchanges, the Prague stock exchange swung into the negative
After Tuesday morning's fall, the Prague Stock Exchange crushed its losses.
Trading with ČEZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily trading.
On Tuesday, as soon as trading began, the Prague stock exchange returned to its fall of the previous day, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in stocks on Wall Street.
The market's reaction to the result of the vote by the US House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the US financial sector stabilisation plan, is thus also visible in our country.
Falling equities in Asia
Asian stock markets experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even if the indices managed, during the day, to erase some of the losses.
The Hang Seng Index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost four percent in trading, but later erased some of the losses and reduced the decline to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index tracking the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 percent as markets closed in Shanghai.
Sydney Stock Exchange shares lost more than five per cent, but eventually the losses were reduced to 4.3 per cent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
"The hesitation about the US bailout will affect financial markets around the world," said Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong's monetary board.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it sets its own monetary policy, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US lawmakers should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will be affected.
The bloodbath in U.S. equities
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, to which it should have spent up to 700 billion dollars (nearly 12 billion dollars).
The lawmakers thus reneged on President George Bush's call for support for President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks were bloodbathed on Monday and major equity indexes fell by the most in 20 years.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly seven percent, having last fallen on such a scale in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress caved in: U.S. government can pump $700 billion into banks
U.S. congressional leaders and President George W. Bush's administration have agreed on a broader form of the agreement to provide financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
It will be put to a vote early next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a turning point in talks on the adoption of a bailout package in the form of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns) in financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
Success is not certain.
Indeed, before they can publish the final version of the law and put it to a vote, the Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Regulation Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should a priori be submitted to the vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the bailout will be adopted should be a first major psychological factor in reviving financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market support can be effective, there will be a "disillusionment".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our differing views on what form the market stabilization package should take," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could be carried out as early as Sunday.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of the legislators met with US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, in order to give the substance of the government a final form.
The latter should buy back from financial companies the unsaleable real estate assets that are causing financial companies to make considerable losses and threatening the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are close to agreeing on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue this market recovery plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis is having a significant impact on falling equity markets.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are working for Congress to reach a final agreement as early as Sunday.
They want to calm investors before the start of trading in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the decision of Congress could affect Monday's trading.
However, for the moment, it is impossible to specify with certainty when the two houses of the US Congress will proceed to the vote, or whether the negotiations are not likely to remain blocked, at the last moment, by this or that problem.
Lawmakers hope it will be passed in the coming days.
Nevertheless, the law will still undergo many amendments.
The total amount intended for the aid of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
But, if Congress feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, it has the option of blocking the remaining amount, following two steps: first an additional $100 billion, and then, finally, $350 billion.
Bush hailed progress in negotiations
While the president can veto this decision, Congress has the option of outvoting him.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain finance for the purchase of bad real estate titles, whose value plummeted, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, says lawmakers have agreed on responsibility for the fiscal program, protecting contributors from losses, agreeing to rebates, running the plan on the timeline.
The new law also provides for the limitation of so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the programme and establishes a committee, which will oversee the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We've been working very this issue and have made significant progress toward a deal that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for property owners, who have problems paying.
The government should negotiate new down payments for mortgages it will buy, while reducing debtors' monthly payments and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to David Marek, chief economist at Patria Finance, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"And this is due to the fact that it is unclear what the mechanism and price of buying the problem assets will be.
This will be decisive in deciding on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek told Server iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or early next week, is, according to Marek, not that important.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree, as early as this week, that they support this plan and that they will enshrine it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, matters most at this time," Marek stressed.
Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current grand coalition, as well as a notable strengthening of populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the present President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly heavy losses.
On the other hand the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 percent of the vote, the country's leading political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 percent of the vote.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent lost nearly nine percent of the vote, finished even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major parties in the post-war period; Especially for the People's Party, which called the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable lead over the SPÖ.
But voters visibly punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculation about the possible resignation of the party leader and the current Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer was pronounced.
Observers believe this could happen as early as Monday, during the extraordinary council of the party leadership.
Such a development would a priori facilitate the path towards the outcome of the election result that remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP grand coalition.
Nevertheless, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Free (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 percent and BZÖ eleven percent of the vote - the Socialists at the same time expressed the fear of a repeat of 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ separated) on a common government.  which even provoked sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already declared that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he plans to return to Vienna on the national political scene, is apparently banking on this development.
The last party to gain access to parliament was the Greens, but these lost slightly and fell from third to fifth among Austrian political parties.
Obviously, no other party crossed the four percent limit and entered parliament.
A fight taken to the extreme: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you, how to choose
While virtually all mobiles can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
It seems to be clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
Nevertheless, there are enough reasons to get an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house an expensive high-end gramophone to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products are not released on vinyl records, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
However, if there are piled vinyl records on your shelves, with art rock, jazz or blues, you probably dream of such a gramophone.
The same is true of music on the go, namely compressed music, to put it simply—music in MP3.
Here too, there are categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a reader, in the same way that a Pink Floyd fan would find it difficult to bear headphones bought for twenty crowns at the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Battery life is also decisive
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just music playback, but these are functions unknown, of course, to most mobiles.
No device today is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, phone calls and sending SMS, it is able to play music and movies, record them, it has a camera of variable quality and can, for example, be used for navigation.
And if we take into account smartphones and communicators, you will have in your pocket a small computer.
Since no fridge knows how to grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are practically witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal nature of the mobile is not without drawbacks.
The more functions you use, the shorter the interval between reloads.
And reading music is one of the most important energy goinfres.
Are rare mobiles that are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this respect, music players (especially the most rudimentary) are much more efficient.
In the case of cheap mobiles, count on them playing music for only a few hours.
If, in addition, you happen to call from time to time, get a second recharge for work to be sure - this is valid even for more expensive devices.
This problem will not arise for MP3 players, which are capable, following recharging, of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least efficient ones.
Another problem arises while recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all of them can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
You can, of course, record music directly to the memory card, but few card readers know how to do it without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of memory cards used in mobiles.
As far as drives are concerned, you do not need, with some exceptions (iPod), any software.
Simply fill, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and players will create themselves a media library classified according to the name of the performer, the title of the album, the style, or according to the judgment of the user.
Some devices display only an index with a tree structure, like the Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles have more know-how
When choosing a specific device, pay particular attention to the life of the battery, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of control.
If music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if during the day you will listen to it only for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile playing MP3.
Virtually all mobiles today are capable of this.
You don't even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or player is able to play.
All of them manage to play MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will have precisely this format.
It is one of the most popular formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also play WMA format music.
AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods), meanwhile, is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
Simply visit the corresponding operator's (or those of another provider's) website from your mobile phone and purchase the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to get a music mobile.
The operators' offer is unfortunately miserable and it is limited, in most cases, to radio tubes quickly made.
Prices are also not the lowest.
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether by mobile phone, internet, or even wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobile with them.
Every time you feel like listening to something, you just have to take the mobile out of your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have headphones or a handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in speakers, which almost all mobiles have, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of music mobiles is their price.
The cheapest ones normally cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand crowns, one can have a walkman already very suitable.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the lack of output for regular headphones.
The price of the best and best equipped phones, also provided with an input for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy order.
Really anyone manages to order the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the resemblance of the command to that of a cassette station, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of mobile internet plugged in by chance, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. The Vodafone 527) usually has a swappable memory card slot (the M2 type, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models in principle only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive get by even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, choose specialized walkman mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and this is how the ease of control is closer to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that has gone the furthest in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a longer memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in Czechia is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force traditional operators to lower prices.
It may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned many times on Mobil.cz the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The ČTÚ (Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher here than in the rest of the Union, confirmed this.
Thus, following the latest steps taken by the European Commission in the field of roaming fee regulation, a paradoxical situation is likely to arise - SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper for some customers of Czech mobile operators than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are keeping up so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks a competition that would really like to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that is well over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), who has repeatedly stated that in the Czech Republic there is no room for another operator, is chordding with the operators.
It is probably true that a traditional operator with its own network apparently no longer has much luck (moreover, by the way, it would now find frequencies with difficulty).
However, there is still one possibility - a virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that led to a considerable drop in prices, to which traditional operators subsequently also had to react.
Yet, even before spoilers such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market, voices similar to those we hear today in Britain were being heard.
However, it appeared that there was still room for such operators and that they could have real success.
We do not have to look too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator managed to gain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Let us add that behind the Mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, which owns among others the U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be effective, they need far fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They are exempt from the relatively high costs of building, operating and maintaining the mobile network.
Thus, around the world, virtual operators are profiling themselves as low-cost operators – they offer cheap calls and texts, which is often offset by a limited service offering.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in Great Britain at least half as expensive as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, focusing on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity stunt.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
"Real men choose Mobilking – an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which operates the virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept would be likely to work here as well.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of service offering."
In Czechia, no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in Czechia the negotiations are not very promising.
The launch of Mobilking will instead take place in other countries in our area," Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for the Penta financial group, said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, in any event, not in favour of that idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible so that a potential competitor cannot appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of corporate customers, has not hidden, for quite some time, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We are very keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile ones.
And the sooner the better.
We have already negotiated this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we managed to move forward in the negotiations," said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So the future may be bright.
According to unofficial information, it seems that we could perhaps welcome the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for now, its creation is accompanied by total silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with others very specific.
For the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this field has contacted us," Vlastimil Sršeň of Telefonika O2's press department said in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová says in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not yet registered any viable and bilaterally advantageous project that could serve as a basis."
She added: "It is virtually out of the question that a virtual operator will appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a short period of time, we should have a concrete agreement now."
Instead, Vodafone is focusing its attention on fulfilling requests for its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says of this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This is what we think means the most input from a customer perspective.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to set up a common network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities: in tune with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and therefore to a decrease in their profit.
What is the point of facilitating the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators know how to get along like thieves at a fair. The quarrel accompanying the creation of the U:fon also testifies to this.
The greatest apparent pressure on ČTÚ, when U:fon was created, was that exerted by the company T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the ČTÚ web pages.
However, today, the U:fon lends itself to serve as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: "Competition in the mobile market has also recently been amplified by the entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile RT market, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would place high demands on it, and especially its services."
But given the attitude of the following mobile operators, the indifference of the Czech regulators seems disconcerting.
However, this is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ, which, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power in the Czech Republic to intervene in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
However, the latter adopted, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question concerning the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded for the moment, because the offer of potential interested parties has not a priori been of sufficient interest to traditional operators," Kristián Chalupa of the ÚOHS External Relations Department said in response to our question.
A statement made in this way would not come as a surprise from representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, also take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, such a statement is more than confusing.
Especially since Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual operators are normally present, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in the prices of mobile telephone services."
However, pushing for the honest functioning of the market and lower prices is apparently not in the interests of the ÚOHS.
What is indeed shocking is the almost touching concord of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, arises quite naturally.
In the same way, a strictly identical price of gasoline at all service stations is probably due to chance and the hard fight of the competition.
"The Office has not found any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard, so it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, and therefore none has a correspondingly increased responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market to virtual operators are probably even lacking in the telecommunications regulator," Chaloupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of market dominance is one of the many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets prepared by the ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts propose a different view of things: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained each time.
And the mobile operator quite logically has the monopoly on its network.
This is how it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should at least be worrying for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are visibly proceeding in a similar way.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Shifting responsibility onto the ČTÚ is a fairly common trick in communications, by means of which the ÚOHS washes its hands of the case.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, the novelization of the recently adopted Telecommunications Act did not include an extension of the powers of the ČTÚ in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised an improvement in the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know this very well, but their interests apparently lie elsewhere.
When no one is looking, it can work
That said, the operation of a kind of pseudo-virtual operators, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telephone services, but these are only partially public.
In most cases, it is a question of firms dealing with multi-level marketing.
Particularized mobile telephone services are offered for example by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually only reach elected officials.
The magic trick consists in the fact that the company does in front of the operator figure of a classic corporate customer, who orders a large quantity of SIM cards.
As an important customer, it obtains special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If what you mention happens, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would examine and that could lead to a cessation of collaboration with the company in question," Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this problem.
Nevertheless, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such activity has not reached the managers of mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
No operator, however, is against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them non-negligible profits, and, at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are only used by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, like ordinary mobile operator customers."
This is precisely what should seem strange to ČTÚ.
In addition, another question arises at ÚOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to such a procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has relatively broad powers to be able to disclose such an activity, and if it will not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibiting it.
When we will no longer be the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a considerable decrease in the price of services.
However, in practically all the countries where virtual operators appeared, the traditional operators tried, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market that was too small or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that regulatory bodies in developed countries have intervened, which defended not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Both through formal measures and informal pressure, they eventually obtained the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators treat this issue like a hot potato that is disposed of by passing it on to a nearby target.
As a result of the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is more than beneficial to them in these cases.
But let's not throw the handle after the knock.
If the behind-the-scenes information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear here, the Czech mobile market may get moving again.
If one of the operators has agreed to the creation of a mobile virtual operator, the ÚOHS will hardly be able to remain impassive in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling for more than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with male or female solo singing, choir performance and instrumental version.
Vocals are provided by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the arrangements of the anthem.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers Czech national singing to be one of the most beautiful anthems.
As he had previously told Český rozhlas (Czech public radio), he chose solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated, for the interpretation.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that both singers, as well as the choir, had good diction, so that we understood the lyrics, that they sang simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj resounded for the first time in 1834 on the stage of Stavovské divadlo (Estates Theatre) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des savetiers), an original Czech play by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by František Škroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslaovaquie in 1918, the first verse naturally became part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
Prague public transport (MHD) will introduce chip into its ticketing system on Wednesday
Wednesday, 1 October 2008, the Pražský Dopravní podnik (Prague Transport Agency) will go down in history as the date on which the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latter is accessible to about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day or 90-day voucher (it will be valid from 1 January 2009) and have it registered on their smart card at information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (Transport Agency), located in the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl,  Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday there is also the possibility to buy the coupons online on the web pages of the Dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people enjoyed the service during the morning.
Those who start using the online store can permanently forget about the ticket offices in metro stations, where until now they had to trample impatiently in long queues in order to get paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their voucher online and it will be registered on their Opencard in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these contact points, there is a counter available to passengers with trained staff, which will help interested parties with the purchase via the internet and, in addition, will record the coupon they have purchased on their card," says project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, it will also be possible to save electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket composting machines and passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today the city has five, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrný added.
A vending machine will control the coupon instead of the driver
The PLCs that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
Simply introduce the Opencard chip card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
The electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity of the city.
Namely in suburban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which mainly use the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In trains integrated into Pražská integrovaná doprava (Integrated Transport of Prague), controllers are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of coupons;" explained ticket control Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization, which designs Prague public transport timetables.
Suburban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver's checkout.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard in the indicated place on the side of the cash register.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger needs to check the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take suburban buses and will not remember when the validity of their coupon expires, can rejoin the vending machines, initially used to save coupons on the card.
It is there, on the screen of the device, that the information concerning the validity of their document will be displayed.
The Sudetenland demanded a referendum in the USA
The Sudeten Germans demanded in 1945 that Šumava be integrated into the United States.
This stems from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of South Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we at least want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such desire.
This stems, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
Germans in Český Krumlov ask the US president in the letter not to allow "šumavská župa" (forest region in southern Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," reads the letter, signed "People, to whom the fate of Šumava is dear."
Since the rallying to Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, inconsiderate attitude, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take the protectorate of Šumava into his hands for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a state foreign to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and which did nothing to contribute to the victory of the Allies without taking into consideration the opinion of the quarter of a million inhabitants," the letter reads.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans in Šumava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the USA, or to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat naïve, according to some survivors, it illustrates well the expectations of the Sudeten Germans of the time.
While the Czech Germans must at least have foreseen that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them admitted such a possibility.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would obtain some kind of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others believed they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, as a German from České Budějovice, he was engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and placed in the capture camp in the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that once they got home, Czech would benefit them," Chalupa said.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed, according to him, that, as a result of the Beneš Decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most costly road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček believes that it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and drinking and driving.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
Above all, it wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
This is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You don't think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
Then, in a puddle of blood, there is the phrase "You will pay".
This must symbolize that we can pay with life for a moment of inattention.
The spots will "haunt" spectators until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where one can commonly see images with drastic images of the victims of accidents.
He believes that this will lead to a decrease in the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The strategy of sugar and whipping against drivers
"What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time, when they run a red light.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers need to be reminded of the risks," says Martin Kořán, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is why we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, says the psychologist.
Signs warning the danger to drivers are, according to him, already less effective.
"When a static hazard warning sign is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and drivers will no longer notice it," Kořán said.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmert, the president of Israel's interim government, came out in favor of returning virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made the statement in an interview published Monday by the Yedioth Ahronoth daily.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert told the daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to cede to the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), because without it, peace will not be achieved," he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"Whoever desires security in Jerusalem, and especially does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert remarked, referring to the two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historical places" located inside the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he later stressed.
Golan Heights retreat
Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel's retreat from the Golan Heights, which he said was a prerequisite for a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I am not proposing to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retreat from the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to renounce their constant support for the terrorism of Hamas (Shiite movement), al-Kaeda (terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (holy war) in Iraq," the prime minister said.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are likely to cool
If the problem of Czech researchers accused of illegal cockroach picking could not be resolved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg would lead to a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister said so today in New York, after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not solved, then yes, some cooling would occur," he said after the meeting, which followed a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, as he left the talks, that it was difficult for the executive branch to intervene in court cases.
He mentioned, however, that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was cleared of the charge and punished with a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the case being under the jurisdiction of the latter.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, who has been sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
He could then apply for bail and await trial, he said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also spoke in the same direction during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicts with "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance was already being provided to them by India as well.
"Above all, we want to maintain the best relations with India, which have a tradition that continues for many years.
The Indians recognize this as well," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We consider the incarceration and accusation of these Czech researchers to be a great misunderstanding," he said.
The minister dodged the question whether he had obtained a promise from India to deal with the matter.
"I've already received quite a few promises," he said only.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are the stewards on the bus illegal?
The law ignores them; Walking in a long-distance bus is prohibited
In the context of the tragic accident on the Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arises as to whether stewards and passengers can travel inside the coach during the journey.
"If one wanted to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, in which a 22-year-old flight attendant perished, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck who crossed the path of the bus.
The girl was at that time unfortunately sitting next to the driver, in the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had at her disposal two other seats.
However, the bus can have an accident, or even brake suddenly, also when the steward is serving coffee or distributing newspapers.
What matters is whether the coach is equipped with standing or not according to its data sheet.
If this standing equipment is not homologated, passengers must remain seated.
Student Agency long-distance coaches do not have standing room; this was confirmed to Aktuálně.cz by the company's director Radim Jančura.
"This is an issue we have dealt with with the ministry and, at first, it prohibits all passenger movement.
Then they cancelled it and we got passengers to go to the toilet during the journey as long as they have their own seat," he said.
The law ignores the steward
"There is no unequivocal legal interpretation of the role of steward - there is no legal requirement dealing with this role.
On the other hand, there is also no legal requirement that prevents the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act only covers the term "vehicle receiver"; it does not define its rights and duties," Hanzelka spokesman added more ambiguously.
Josef Pokorný, director of the Department of Road Traffic, believes, on the contrary, that the law sufficiently addresses the problem.
"It all depends on whether the coach has permission in its homologation to offer standing places.
It's all in there," he said.
Coaches are divided into urban, where there are standing places and limited maximum speed, intercity with standing places and a higher authorized speed and long-distance coaches without standing with the highest maximum authorized speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Hořín, an expert in transport safety at BESIP (Road Traffic Safety), does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"In regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service on airplanes.
Again, it is not sure when turbulence will occur and the stewardess may hit her head."
"However, in the event that the bus braked suddenly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as in a city bus or on a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of stewards through internal regulations," he says and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jančura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only coach carrier to offer stewards.
He hired two hundred.
Even after this accident, the manager does not consider their job to be a risky job.
"Nevertheless, as soon as I have the impression that this is a risky profession, I will delete it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper upon boarding.
It would also lower costs," he said.
Safety concerns are the reason given to the absence of stewards in his vehicles by the director of the Asiana Alexey Litvin, who ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have hostesses. We have opposed it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," he told Týden.cz a year ago.
A huge tragedy has happened
A young hostess from the Plzeň region, who had been working for the company for two years, perished in the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency lane without using a turn signal and blocked the way for the bus.
The latter's driver tried to avoid him by means of a sudden maneuver, but he brushed him by his right side.
Jančura refused that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards had been sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these seats, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the driver of the truck.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the judgment of the court, but as far as financial compensation is concerned, it also relies on the culprit.
A change in the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the law, which has been being drafted for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could clarify the movements of stewards on board the bus.
"However, it did not reach any conclusion on this point.
To tell the truth, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the points system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones while driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards as something that would fundamentally jeopardize the safety of passengers," Hanzelka said, adding that the control of bus safety is under the authority of the police and the Occupational Safety Authority.
Czech referees fight for seabed
It approaches an electronic wall chart, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are depicted.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as does the adjacent seabed.
Yet this area is as big as the continent itself," says Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the thirty-member team of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
Its head, the director of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and supplements it from time to time.
Hard work and enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a world little known until now, rich in natural resources.
It can contain oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also previously unknown living organisms, which may hold the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A bottom larger than land
Coastal states have now begun to vehemently aspire to new underwater territories.
According to a UN convention, they use their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
The latter may, according to the convention, claim exclusively all the resources of the continental shelf.
"To put it simply, continental shelf is considered to be the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles that represent the so-called exclusive economic yone," Mikulka explains.
The request that the country in question submits to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific-technical documentation, based on numerous costly surveys and metrises.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
So far, the committee has dealt with five applications, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," Mikulka adds.
Australia's success, which was the first to significantly expand its underwater possessions, has recently gained global recognition.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the extent of the seabed, allocated to it by the commission last week, is 1.6 million square kilometres, which is the size of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The benefit they will derive in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they project, be invaluable.
Gradually, other countries will also submit their request.
They may do so within ten years of ratifying the "Montego Bay Convention".
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean floor, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no state enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this zone is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"Nevertheless, make no mistake, the seabed is not a Klondike," says director Mikulka, exaggerating, adding that "its areas are precisely clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, the latter, together with investors from a few other States, obtained the status of a so-called "pioneer investor" under the Convention.
It has the right to mine in the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The background is hectic, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract on an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a rich deposit of polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such a concretion.
It is reminiscent of a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
The hopes of the people of Düsseldorf rest on Frankfurt.
There was no shortage of big words in the letter sent by the WestLB Board of Directors to the employees of the house.
Through a union of the entities of the financial institute of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central institution of the financial markets of the financial group of the Sparkasse" could be constituted, according to the letter made public Monday.
WestLB would bring a "competence block" coupled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be the decisive kick-off to further mergers in the banking sector of the Länder.
This is what it looks like when a steering committee wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the injured WestLB is still under great pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority that has only recently made it clear to the government of the Land of North Westfalia that time is running out in the search for a future solution.
However, there has been talk for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side - of a relationship of some form between Deka Bank, which knows Sparkasse's customers through their investment funds, and WestLB.
Deta-Bank chief Franz Waas made it clear during the presentation of the half-year figures at the end of August that he did not see any point in merging the house on Mainzer Landstrasse with a state bank, be it Helaba or WestLB.
However, the board of directors of Deka, each half of which is supported by both the banks of the Länder and the savings bank groups, instructed the steering committee to conduct talks with WestLB with a view to joint commercial activities.
This could be the flow from the financial market, or parts of it.
However, talks have only just begun, according to the financial centre.
This is not the first time that Deta-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the largest employers in Frankfurt's financial centre, has come into play when it comes to consolidating the savings bank sector.
In 2003 it was thought for a while that Deta-Bank could merge with the Rhineland-Palatinate and Halbab.
Yet nothing came out of this ternary bouquet.
No sooner had the plans been made public than the Hessian government decided against any participation by Hellaba in them.
Subsequently, the other two houses did not meet either.
The Bank of the Land of Rhineland-Palatinate was instead attached to the Bank of the Land of Baden-Wüttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new negotiations on the merger of Deka-Bank with banks in the Länder.
Finally, however, Günther Merl, chairman of the board of directors of Hellaba, spoke out against any commercial strategy of merging with his bank.
Quite apart from this, there seems to be a growing feeling that the consolidation of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Bavarian state parliament has passed, a union of BayernLB with the Baden-Wuttenberg state bank could materialise first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure to merge should increase, potential partners are gradually slipping away.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it has so far weathered the crisis better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hessen-Thuringian Savings and Transfer Group, which owns 85 percent of Helaba's capital, closed any union with WestLB at the beginning of the year.
NordLB would remain at a pinch.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one facet.
Another facet is how the different business models of each of these banks can match.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question of the future capacity of the banks in the Länder should be ensured had not yet been resolved by the German Savings and Credit Transfers Group.
Eventually, a carving up of the WestLb could take place, a carving up which here is obviously not desired.
This is also what the letter of the current management committee is about: in any case, a 'global solution' for the institution would be targeted.
How all this will be lumped together with the union of certain entities with Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the weekend of the Italians.
For Elena, it's the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies him as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, nearly a five-liter barrel of Kaiser beer, stands a well-built bearded man who shows about 200 beer festival visitors what deep sounds his throat can make.
Elena taps Luca first, then kisses him.
From Bologna they came as far as Verona.
From there, from the bus station near Puorta Nueva station, four buses depart tonight at 11:45 p.m., 'destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', arriving at 6:30 a.m.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses travel bresilens exclusively.
In a corner of the parking lot, South Americans are singing gold and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And as noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it is not for Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with faux fur and glasses with wide silver frames.
For the past five years, they have been going to the beer festival, already three trips just this year.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and return at 10:30 p.m.
Staying overnight would involve unnecessary costs, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome drink with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a German-speaking group leader - Marco did a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses run at night on the Autostrada direction 'Brennero'.
There is no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes quiet on the bus, travelers sleep.
It's better that way, they will still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian license plates are once again taking a break shortly before Munich, on Highway 8.
When Marco's group finally arrived at six thirty as planned in the car park near Place Thérèse in the early morning, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe were already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco makes one last speech, explains the plan of attack.
First: wear the little yellow cap.
On it is written on the left 'Beer Festival', in Gothic, and next to it the internet address of Marco's travel agency 'conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: 'When the doors of the beer tent open, we run,' Marco shouts in the early morning.
'Run!' Run and reserve places at the back of the tent.
'Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, we must distribute them in the room!'
The mug, Marco shouts, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the instructions!
'Show the security guards that we are behaving well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they are gone!'
Third: 'Tonight, to have come back here is half past ten!' Got it?
And that's it, let's go to the beer festival.
On the way, someone ties yellow caps to trees to find their way, to signs and even to an election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
We want to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the 'weekend of the Italians'.
There are no precise figures; there is talk of 50,000 who set off through the Alps and collapsed in the beer kiosk, 10 percent of visitors would have come from Italy on purpose this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tirol, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, which produces statistics on the countries where Italians occupy first place ahead of the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, insisted the Federal Finance Minister only a few weeks ago.
How fortunate that the politician used the word 'relatively' and slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared from crisis movements.
It did indeed happen this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed on the DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a loan of one billion to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that aid credits are issued up to an amount of 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate would now have to pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
The money comes as much from private banks as from banks under public law.
In the background, it is the daughter company Depfa that bears the losses.
The state financier had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced himself in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible because of mistrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve was reduced by 95% to €2.37 million, while the equity ratio also fell slightly from 1.6% to 1.45%.
Profits outstanding and net profits from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the same period the previous year, profits from the assignment of receivables and specified securities and the termination of provisions in credit operations had fallen by more than 70 per cent to €5 million.
And it was only thanks to the large profits from the reimbursement of downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern companies, that the earnings deficit of about 16 percent turned out to be moderate.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financier had first speculated badly on industrial real estate loans, which had then been subsidized at the Aareal bank.
Because traditional state financing was not profitable enough, Depfa then became more intensively involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of projects jointly between private investors and the State (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the daughter company, Hypo Real Estate must carry out depreciation which should have an essential material effect on the calculation of the group's gains and losses which is nevertheless rather unclear.
The fact is that dividends have been cut.
Already for 2007, they had been truncated by two-thirds.
Since the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important state and infrastructure investor.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing on the inter-bank market since it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, credit allocation between banks has again dried up considerably as banks have accumulated liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a part - about 50 billion euros - of all Depfa loans from a short-term means of refinancing.
According to a press release from Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing requirement is covered with medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets largely out of order at present.
Other sources say that refinancing would be ensured with the funds until the end of 2009.
On the other hand, Georg Funke, Chairman of the Executive Board of HRE explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer have to resort to the financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institution for the Supervision of Financial Services (Bafin) assume that the Hypo Real Group's market capacity is now assured.
The bank's shareholders and creditors can only hope so.
However, given the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not unthinkable, moreover, that funding should not be used to its full extent.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest press releases, still on the verge of insolvency late Sunday evening, this rescue for the least temporary will not succeed in reassuring the spirits either.
The share price collapsed by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are doing particularly well.
While debts in the first place have barely moved, the prices of second-tier loans are falling.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former daughter company Württemberg Hypo and those that have a lifespan beyond 2009.
The bonds of the bank Hypo Real Estate previously seemed to be an alternative speculative investment, now their value must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself that brought the crisis into the institution by the purchase of the Depfa bank.
As long as less affected issuing institutions, governments and commercial banks are still prepared to support the system, arrears can be assumed to be cleared in time.
Or what no one dares to hope for at the moment – that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of renewed rumours of partial nationalization, the probability approaching security has now become a mere well-founded hope.
This should reserve sleepless nights primarily for long-term creditors on whether to part with their commitments.

German special forces were on hand for the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready but they never took action.
More and more details about the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are revealed.
According to the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
Thus, specialists from the Federal Army as well as officials from GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from the Technischen Hilfwerk were at the place of liberation.
As the spokesman for the Ministries communicated on Monday evening, the German forces were finally not required, the hostage-takers having released their prisoners and having fled when they recognized the imminence of a release by force.
The Egyptian government would have accepted the assistance offered by Germany to integrate it there as a support force.
"Fortunately, it hasn't come this far," said a spokesman for the Federal Interior Ministry.
The attackers had kidnapped the group of tourists in southern Egypt, consisting of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian escorts.
After their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transferred to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers has so far remained vague, as have details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who were rescued have meanwhile arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin for the moment, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", the five holidaymakers and special forces are expected to have taken off in an air force Airbus and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to show up for the first day at Tachibana Highschool, the girls start laughing: the German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to Manga - in her new Exchange Log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of classes in Japan.
What was I excited about.
Already the way to school scared me.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I take the 40-minute train to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the way on my own, fortunately I did not get lost.
The start of classes does not seem to be as strictly fixed as here in Lower Saxony.
The pupils appear one after the other from eight o'clock, until at nine to twenty, a round table begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not one to like to talk in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have the school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of my host mother, as well as a shirt, blue high socks and black leather shoes.
So in this outfit, I stood in front of the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and my birthday is a week away.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all said low masses, laughed and waved, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii."
I already knew him from my manga.
It belongs to the vocabulary essential to the survival of Japanese teens and means "cute, cabbage".
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to me gave me a big wry smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent had to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was assaulted in the rules.
Everyone was talking to whoever was better, laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it's quite difficult to understand English Japanese.
During the break, they all took out their Bento.
My host mom had also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something other than the miserable German snacks.
I had herb rice, small sausages, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and some kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things look weird and taste completely new.
What is certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the candied salted plums, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared particularly carefully - in the hope of being able to get to know the boy a little better during the break.
I read this in my manga.
I am curious to know if I could observe it here as well.
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
I always replied:
"Because it fascinates me, what"
In the end, reading manga is what I've been my favorite for years.
And in order to better understand manga and the culture in it, at one point, I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, habits and customs.
And here, they are given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends – on the other hand, it is harsh, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
U.S. House of Representatives rejects bailout
The first chamber of the US Congress narrowly defeated the $700 billion bailout of the financial markets.
The Dow Jones was tumbling into the abyss.
By 227 votes to 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout for financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of U.S. President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that was supposed to stem the chaos of the financial markets did not win a majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the parties had desperately tried to convince opponents of the merits of this massive $700 billion plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called on MPs to vote in favor even though the plan was unpopular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he conceded.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was investor concern that the state bailout could collapse.
It rose shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of failure, fell again.
Experts are now projecting further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
For the program to enter into force, the approval of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are required.
Rats also have sensations
A rat or a cockroach flees from danger, does that mean that he also feels fear?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he feels the same way when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having been able to prove it until now, just as it cannot be proven that other human beings have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the questions of feeling or in general consciousness, we enter difficult to penetrate because the Hardware does not correspond.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it plays dead, flees or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe it.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transpose our subjective experience to that of animals.
One aspect is that the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and in the functions of direction and execution).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in other beings.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the awareness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being differs even from other primates.
Another significant peculiarity could lie in the linguistic nature of man: since much of his existence is related to language, this often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not to depend on language, language would surely influence it, so that animal consciousness, however it is produced, would probably differ greatly from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is so difficult to determine what consciousness can look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, can neither be measured nor, because of this particular Hardware, analyzed based on our own experience, then its observation poses big problems for us.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness besides that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without considering their content, and this is exactly what has happened in studies of the short-term memory of primates, particularly with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: the two can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the Prefrontal Cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what then results for emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
What we call "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) monopolizes the living memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our voluble nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impute them to others than to ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that sensations from primitive activities arise in the bodily sensation regions of the cortex and brainstem, as does Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brainstem.
As this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could quite participate in transverse sensations of all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it is unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in humans and rats is probably also felt as such in both cases: how could we verify whether rats and humans feel the same way when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach flees from danger, but what if he feels fear?
In my opinion, similar behaviours are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Certainly, the nervous comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain trunks, cockroaches on the other hand do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem the cause of sensations?
And even if we could prove this for humans: how could we demonstrate it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are likely completely different from ours (since human consciousness relies on special circuits and language), I'd rather explore the emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is emerging on the nervous level insofar as we gauge the same thing in rats and in humans.
Since I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, or sensations, I don't know if they exist.
You might think of it as short-term, but I'd rather move forward than constantly bang against a wall.
I am indeed a pragmatic emotional.
UEFA President Platini: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government considers UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise, together with Poland, the European Championships," Wasjunik said.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the schedule of construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are chasing deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at maximum speed," Ukrainian League President Grigorij Surkis said.
"UEFA is constantly watching us."
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The management of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, an independent administrator.
The commission met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN would not be able to act properly," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured the UEFA President in a letter that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer."
Several members of the First Division league were, already in the previous season, convicted of compulsory relegation manipulation; in the end, the start of the League even had to be postponed to the last minute.
Organizers report increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the coming months, according to a study, turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - even by more than 30 percent in the winter season.
Despite the weak economic outlook, the thirst for travel of Germans remains insatiable according to this study.
As for bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 percent compared to the same period the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) said Monday in Berlin.
According to the survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, increasing booking figures are already dominating the autumn months.
As a result, the sales figure would have climbed to about 11 percent compared to 2007, said the DRV.
The sources of these results are the figures of the GfK, which analyzes monthly booking data from 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the overall market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded there.
Due to the low dollar rate, travel to the US would be in particular demand, the DRV said.
There, the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our country would be particularly sought after destinations by the Germans.
Organized trips in particular are in high demand, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs here would be "more easily calculable for the customer than for an individually organized trip".
Consumers can save money with early booking discounts or All Inclusiveivie offers, among other things, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well held back, so that an increase in sales figures will again be recorded compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who have undertaken a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
Dennis Quaid outraged strikes back
She wanted to promote a new movie, talked about her private life in an interview — and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has lifted the veil on her adulterous ex Dennis Quaid.
He foams - and counterattacks.
A late Rose War for the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are engaged in an unsightly battle - in full view of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of the failure of the marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have become aware of the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The motive for this thought striptease lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his characterization of an unfaithful husband was clear: it would be "Monstrous", he told the "New York Daily News", 54 years old, that "Meg once again rehashes the story of our relationship and manipulates it".
It would also be "regrettable" if "the pain and upheaval that a divorce entails for each child is again revived in public" for their common 16-year-old son Jack.
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
So was his response to the claw: "In any case, my life goes on.
I consider myself happy to have a wonderful family that is doing well."
Airfare and hotel prices are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights are even reduced by up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights have reportedly become advantageous again - this is the result of a study by financial and travel services provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and established, after a price increase in the first quarter, a sharp decline in profits in the second quarter.
After prices in the hotel market have been rising for years, hotel nights have already reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear, especially in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would lie for American Express in the low rate of the dollar which has led to a "desire for travel in decline of American tourists".
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices stood at a 26.3 percent increase, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was upward in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, economy class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, and long-haul flights, which consume a lot of fuel, even increased by up to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, economy class ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, while in business class and first class, however, price changes were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter, they fell by 23.6 percent.
German domestic flights have even been halved according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would be on the one hand a weakening economic growth, explains the firm.
Demand would lose ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there is increased pressure from competition through the Open Skies Treaty, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
A sign of the tense situation is the cancellation by airlines of unprofitable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies in Europe alone.
HSV beat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple goal and methods, SV Hamburg became first in the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not managed to find a functional eleven.
By Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Crash landing for international player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player did not return to the game until late and his raised shot failed against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, it had come out of his lips in a persuasive way.
He just knew he was right.
"We need that second goal," Hermann Rieger whistled in the corridor of the changing rooms of the Hamburg arena.
There wasn't much going on in the locker room, half-time was over and most of them had sat back in their seats.
Rieger was for almost three decades the physiotherapist of the HSV, he enjoys a great reputation like many former protagonists.
And that is why his request was received at strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and gave a thumbs up to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second goal!
Practical implementation has been lacking.
"Everything was not very beautiful to see today," Marcel Jansen later confessed.
Bastian Reinhard would have "also liked to be more relaxed".
This 1:0 (1:0 at half-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful header strike by Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that Gladbach's very weak players couldn't hurt Hamburg's weak players.
"It was a dirty victory," summed up Marin Jol.
SV Hamburg will celebrate its 121st anniversary on Monday.
Already on Saturday afternoon, the fans celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as first in the class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to take a step back," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictability of the first League than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivals - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen poached from FC Bayern - is certainly slowly forming, but it does not shine yet.
"We need more charm and more dribbling," Jol demanded.
My first time at the Beer Festival
Ballermann's hits or Apres-Ski continuously, beer in pitchers by the liter and celebrities in designer Tyrolean costumes.
An event at the beer festival.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She is blonde, a TV host and wears a tailor-made Tyrolean suit.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes to the beer festival, and already the photographers throw themselves on us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and this on my first visit to the beer festival.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean suit seems to achieve its goal.
As a beer festival tourist and normally living north of the Weißwurst equator, my sense of well-being in traditional costume was so far limited.
But once on Place Thérèse, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears a Tyrolean suit or leather trousers; No one looks jaded or ashamed - this is completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean suit gets a few weird glances at the banana-chocó stand.
A Bavarian woman pointed out to me that I would have badly fastened my apron: "on the left means free, in the middle virgin, on the right cased, in the back widow."
Discreetly, I fiddle with my loop from back to left.
"That's better," she tells me and laughs.
Others do not go to as much trouble for these subtle techniques of flirting and wear simple markers, on which is written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and exposes us their naked hindquarters without being invited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, arrives from England and comes for the first time to the beer festival.
He finds it "gorgeous", with an elongated "ooooo".
He tells me all this after relieving himself of the mug he had drunk before.
Directly next to this fire hydrant that everyone believes to be a garbage can.
Bob is therefore one of those infamous "wild".
Others are not lucky enough to be able to get rid of alcohol this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, scores of rescuers run on the festival square and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Instead, the nurses intervene in packs - always in fours, they drag their stretcher covered from tents to tents.
It works that way for most beer festival visitors: we go empty, we come back full.
Those who rest in the coffin of the bourrés under the tarpaulin are not visible.
"These are the ones who can't swallow anything anymore," one of the rescuers shouts at me in response to my question and then disappears into the fray.
After the vote failed
On Wall Street, fear is circulating.
Initial news of the failure of the bailout caused the Dow Jones to fall temporarily by 700 points.
It was the biggest single-day point loss in history.
Later, the Dow Jones caught up a bit.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world's largest stock index was trading at 10,579 points, down five percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange Index was at 1548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The biggest losers of the Dow Jones at that time were American Express which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No stock could yield any more profits.
Shares of Bank Goldman Sachs fell by almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffet partnered with the company.
As part of the rescue plan, resources must be mobilized for the purchase of so-called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the sum should not be paid all at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company that can be exchanged in connection with the evolution of the price in order to reduce the burden on the Treasury.
Stock prices sucked into the vortex in Europe and the United States
The billions in aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not alleviate investors' concerns.
The share price of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The US Dow Jones index collapses despite the rescue of the financial market planned by the state.
Dramatic declines in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The shares of the Bavarian real estate financier lost three quarters of their value at times despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, Commerzbank fell by more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped significantly below the important psychological bar of 6,000 points and stood at 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
Around the world, equity markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the U.S. government's massive $700 billion bailout might not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 points lost in the first hour of opening 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The U.S. House of Representatives had intended to vote on the bailout, with the Senate vote expected to follow on Oct. 1.
Other European stock markets have also seen only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index has so far fallen by 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris has lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan's main Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after initially rising 1.26 percent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index slipped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 points.
In MDAX, Arcandor shares fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourism multinational has also indicated that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers perplexed: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying into space.
Due to fuel conductions soon to be frozen, cryogenic death threatens her.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a maneuver of space probes, by which they obtain an additional impulse in the gravitational field of a celestial body, the Earth for example.
Thus, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, as did the Ulysses solar probe.
This is what has surprised researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent as expected according to the venerable laws of gravitation.
Moreover, irregularities appear in terms of speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They called it the gravitational support anomaly.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the attractive force of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong and is trying to explain the gravitational support anomaly using what is called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also found near Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known about dark matter for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, dark matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their captors, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released as confirmed by the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the pre-liberation shooting, six hostage-takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
Ransom negotiations are reportedly already underway.
The Germans are constantly in the crosshairs of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This was communicated jointly by Egyptian state television, the Arabic television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after reports on the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and Romanians and their eight Egyptian escorts are doing well and are safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of the desert excursion should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the hostages' release are still unclear: for example, the kidnappers were ready to stop the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without warning.
"The problem was solved.
They were okay with a ransom," the agent said.
All that remained was to collect the hostages", when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday shot dead six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; The money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to free the female hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers found a safe route to flee.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the account.
Accident victim identified by police
A 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being struck by a vehicle has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in Friday afternoon's crash in the city on Shenfield Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but later died.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Abuse of a stepfather" that led to suicide"
A court was told that years of abuse by her stepfather led to a woman committing suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, has been jailed for six years after admitting eight counts of indecent assault.
The Truro High Court ruled that he regularly linked his daughter-in-law, Stephanie Randle, during her childhood, from 5 to 7 years old.
Trerise wrote in a confessional letter, "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Ms Randle, aged 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise tied her up and bandaged her before forcing her into sexual acts, while her mother worked in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 80s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was told that Ms. Randle, a regular National Trust volunteer, was haunted by the abuse she had been subjected to twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told that Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had appeared since 2006 to be "emotionally dead," and "had lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his flat in Plymouth.
She is believed to have committed suicide by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who had also written a letter of confession which ended as follows: "I tied her up and bandaged her regularly."
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are really weird as a fetishist, your victim must have been terrorized, especially at the age of 7.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the suicide of the victim.
And what is even more astonishing is the fact that if she had not committed this act, her story would certainly never have ended in court."
He added: "I emphasize in particular, as described by her father and mother, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
"Without them, she would probably be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today."
Conviction for loss of official data.
The ministerial officer of the Cabinet Office who had forgotten top secret documents, in June on a train, will be condemned by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC has known.
The man from the Ministry of Defence was travelling when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents passed into the hands of the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious sentence of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said the episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They will have thought that this affair would have remained within the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he declared.
The employee who cannot be appointed, is accused of violating section 8.1 of the act, that is to say the clause that deals with the safeguarding of information.
. The Crown Prosecution Service has suggested that the judicial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the highly sensitive nature of his work in relation to the Associate Committee of the Secret Service.
The documents he lost contained assessments of Al-Qaeda as well as the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret location.
Construction companies facing the B&B bill.
British construction companies may have to pay a bill of more than £80 million, to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The Government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingleys' 2.6 million savers.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that raise money from savers, including 59 construction companies.
The chief executive of the Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "irritating" to know that companies and their members would have to pay the price...
The £14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingleys' mortgages are cleared.
But the interest, which will increase at the same time, will be debited, each year, to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that all 59 construction companies are included in this list.
It is irritating to see that institutions that have behaved prudently— now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company must pay a sum proportional to the deposits it holds, and that intermediary companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that the companies will have to find £81 million to pay the interest of the first year.
Adrian Coles, chief executive of the building companies' trade committee, told the BBC that the move seemed unfair to him.
It is "irritating" to see that institutions that have behaved cautiously during the recovery of the housing market, now have to pay for much less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, when the first records began.
"We need to look at all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to prevent construction companies and their members from paying this hefty bill," Cole said.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest for the entire year will have to be paid, which could double.
Since construction companies are organizations without shareholders, their members end up footing the bill either through higher charges or lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Turkey is broadening its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought about joining the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate its hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 paces from Asia, lies one of the finest relics of his fallen imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha railway station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that's what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation towers at each of its corners, like some German provincial town halls.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we no longer have any doubts about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, lagging behind the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad and the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War 1.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, engendered by the icy borders of the Cold War, is over.
. The British and the forces of the empire advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha Station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say this is sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, engulfed in the meanders of history.
But today, the railway passage to Anatolia and all the eastern points serves - at least symbolically, to underline the broadening of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, engendered by the icy borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new policy of commitments.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a sleeping car heading to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish AKP MP Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a 10 and a half hour journey, shaken on noisy rails whose pace was reminiscent of the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived, in the Turkish capital – presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning my back on its German past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, is an example of changing the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and especially Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, expressly built of stone and steel, in a developing neighborhood, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and numerous pastry shops in which middle managers in suits and ties – men and women – meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Suit, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
"The aim of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey now into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he declared.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Now it has to look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case for both.
She had to do both.
"But at a certain point, 'I asked whether 'Turkey should not choose?'
"Turkey," he said, "does not want to have to choose between the two."
He then pointed out an aspect that almost everyone I spoke with recited to me by heart: The Turkish railway not only goes to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, so it is as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as it is for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe metaphorically traveling on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another night without sleep, I thought back to those two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that European ambitions in the Middle East could, to a large extent, be in Turkey's hands.
As I waited at the terminal for the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period when Turkey was named "the sick man of Europe".
At least there is no longer any doubt on the continent that could claim this country fascinating.
Milk increases to five penny per litre
People in Jersey have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk, by five penny per litre, starting Monday.
This is the second price increase that follows a two-penny increase in February, and comes following research by a consulting firm.
Retail sellers must decide whether they will in turn, raise the price to consumers.
. Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had last varied in 2002.
Former Bangladesh PM denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request to former PM Sheikh Hasina, who is at risk of arrest upon her return to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail because of her indictment for extorting 50 million Taka ($729,000.00) from a businessman when she was PM.
This case is one of many accusations against him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina's longtime rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh within weeks, but her party, the Awani League, has demanded that the country's interim military government first give him full freedom.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of her release are contradictory because if she is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they see no reason why she cannot remain free upon her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court's order.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request saying she does not require bail as she had been allowed to go abroad on medical grounds," her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed the bail to return to the country to prepare for elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, a former Awami party leader said.
She was detained last year after the interim military government assumed power, but was released in June for treatment abroad.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Zhaleda Zia deny the charges against them.
Concerns for Afghanistan's polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children missed the recent polio immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN said.
Last week, the UN carried out a vaccination campaign in all six provinces.
But she says she is unable to contact children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, to the south.
A UN spokesman said this happened despite promises by the Taliban not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses ITV legal battle
BSkyB lost its case following the Competition Commission's verdict, which would force it to reduce its stake in rival transmitter ITV.
The Competitive Appeals Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The commission said that in the past MSkyB's involvement had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement to effectively prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Office reported that BSkyB's purchase of ITV's shares cast doubt on ITV's independence, prompting the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin boss Richard Branson, a consumer group and regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB countered that forcing it to reduce its shares in ITV would not be reasonable and on the contrary was excessive – especially given that BSkyB has just relinquished its voting rights.
New investigation in the case of US prosecutors.
The U.S. attorney general appointed a special prosecutor to verify the firing of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole thing was born from the account of the case of the inspector general of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of some ministerial officers.
The report was critical of White House officers, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the lawyers' argument that their dismissal was due to political causes.
Special Accuser Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to investigators, obstructing justice.
"Serious, unsubstantiated charges of potentially criminal conduct have not been fully confirmed or resolved," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to testify was one of his biggest recommendations.
The dispute began with the December 2006 dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department said prosecutors were fired for poor performance.
But it later emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were no more criticized than their other colleagues, prompting some observers to attribute a political connotation to the dismissals.
Some of the prosecutors have been accused of being close to congressional Republicans, while others have reportedly refused to investigate accusations of fraudulent voting against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute court cases for the government.
Certainly, they can be dismissed at any time, but cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
The head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and in the end, he resigned.
A number of judicial officers from the Justice Department have also resigned.
The inspector general's report was highly critical of Gonzales' role in the case, stating that it considered him "primarily responsible" for the dismissals, and ended up "abdicate" of his leadership role, "succeeding remarkably in not being involved in the case.
Other ministerial officers, including former Bush aide Karl Rove, have been criticized for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf will have to be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf, is set to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honoured" to get the recognition.
The nine-minute, fifty-second song was the hit of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
The awards night is presented by Coldplay, with this year's selection restricted to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like Meat Loaf's.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979, peaking at number fifteen.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell spent nine years in the UK charts, and sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - or Marvin Lee Aday, his real name - has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing surgery to cure his irregular heartbeat, after collapsing on stage in 2003.
In 2007, severe laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then a cyst was found in his vocal cords.
A Dark Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and May Soon Be On Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
. And even some veteran taxis as well as long-time local residents can't give directions to Extra Place because they've never heard of it.
The street is in the East Village and runs north of First Street - not to be confused with Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide by 120 feet long, it looks like a dusty alley rather than an active thoroughfare.
. There are no signs to the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repave Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to shops and boutiques, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including longtime neighbors, said they were charmed by the shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets on the block.
But the city's Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development, which manages the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighborhood homeowners committees, representatives from City Agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal allowing the builder to buy the street.
But the committee prefers that the street remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No. 3.
"There are only a few spaces left belonging to the city, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place," she said.
"They could offer to refurbish it and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to repave the small street and install seats, some of which would be used by a café to which the manufacturer will concede space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, the spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to operate the street, that doesn't necessarily mean it wants to own it.
"The main interest of Avalon Bay is to revamp this abandoned alley, and make it public," she said, noting that it was the city to suggest the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokeswoman for Real Estate Preservation, confirmed that the city was interested in selling the street, noting that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has had this name since 1802, when the legacy of Philip Minthorne's many children's large farm was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since remained abandoned.
The rear entrance to CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of scrap metal, rags, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had previously talked about the East Village's evolution toward luxury, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying the humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place a true rarity – a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be screwed up in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Protests: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at A City in the Process of Extinction") chronicles the history of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow little cul-de-sac, dark day and night, and bounded by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and shutters, full of newspapers from the past week flying along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A rat nimbly runs down the alley, near a door that once led to CBGB, and which has now become the headquarters of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22-ounce beer bottle, lies next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
Some passers-by said they rarely think about Extra Place, and suggested that it be highlighted.
Field, for his part, said he thought some people underestimated the appeal of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were spent in dark, damp and disgusting places."
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former member of studies in California, and former director of the education department at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Thought. Why the middle classes should be able to choose their school. "
Attracting favor with Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Mr. Obama's campaign points out that "African-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students."
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama's education program supports in particular, among many other topics, "bilingual transitional education" for those learning English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve a bilingual education that defends classroom instruction in languages other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are overwhelmingly Hispanic, and of low income.
More than a third of the students, many newcomers, study English.
Among CM1 students, 100% passed the 2008 State Math Exam, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students took the English-Language-Arts exam.
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient than the one advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street relies on analysis, practice, constant assessment of capabilities and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and this is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, principal of Sixth Street, this school has instituted the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
Total English immersion focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, told me, "We had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you would have had no chance to identify him."
It works, she observes, "it worked for us."
Shouldn't Mr. Obama take the example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools composed mostly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results obtained by this school speak for themselves; but education policies within his party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and his enormous support for bilingual education, cloud the prognosis of Mr. Obama's response.
While he supports immigrants learning English, Obama recently dismissed the issue as trivial when he proclaimed that we must all stop arguing about English-language language law.
On the contrary, he said, "You have to make sure your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate differences, then he should carefully consider the models of education that work, rather than disdaining them or seeing them as insignificant.
Net Fall of Oil Following New Concerns of the World of Economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday as people fear that the bailout for financial markets will succeed in reviving the economy.
Crude oil futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel. The Mercantile Stock Exchange of New York, during this morning's sales.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by financial turmoil on Wall Street, as well as two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After rising to $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, before rebounding again in the face of deep financial market uncertainty.
On Monday, investors are again worried despite the agreement on the rescue plan, the largest in history, reached this weekend by congressional leaders.
The news was tempered by recent concerns that the crisis would be lasting.
In the latest episode of this financial disaster, Citygroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, the government said Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partly nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said this weekend's frenetic negotiations, concluded with the bailout deal, "appear to have failed to revive the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and market trading has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
"As far as commodities are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the US virus would spread globally and in particular, in China."
The bank's analysts have lowered their expectations for next year, as oil consumption falls due to slowing economic growth have been forced to cut oil and gas price forecasts for 2009 by 20 percent.
The celebration of the Second Time Decisive for the improvement of the Team Record.
After spending more time than anyone else in a Jets uniform for Shaun Ellis over the past eight seasons, the defenseman thought he had seen it all.
He was watching the second half, when the Jets turned an 0-0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like this," Ellis said.
The second half began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals played dirtily under dark clouds.
Then quarterback Brett Favre made a pass to Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, a precursor to an afternoon in which their relationship took a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second with 10 seconds left in the halftime.
"I didn't get out of my zone" Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
"He's a mediocre player"
"We communicated extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing wrestling, the defense defeated Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, cornerback, intercepted a loose shot and made 32 yards until the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball slip because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of Bowens' ball, may well be the most charming event.
The Cardinals took control of that possession for the final 10 seconds, and then the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard goal to take a 34-0 lead.
It was the best the Jets could have scored in one time.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe the madness, said "the second half or the third?"
When told the two — the Jets dropped 21 unquestionable points in the third half — Mangini said, "I can tell you I enjoyed the second half more than the third.
." A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, surpasses his world record.
Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie once again proved worthy of his title as the best long-distance runner of the century, after breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory of 2:03:59 in a dovish race on the flat, Gebrselassie beat his record of 2:04:26, held last year in Berlin, by 27 seconds.
At 35 years old, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, from the 1600 meters of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympics marathon, fearing — perhaps exaggerated in today's eyes — that air pollution would increase his asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run in Berlin.
In near-perfect conditions – sunny weather, 48 degrees at the start, 55 at the finish – Gebrselassie won on Sunday, maintaining an impressive one-mile average in 4 minutes 43 seconds.
Track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted to long-distance runners, have contributed to the marathon record being lowered by more than two minutes in the last decade, since 1998, when Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05.
After Sunday's win, Gebrselassie told reporters that he suffered from calf cramps two weeks before, and missed training for a week.
It is obvious that rest allowed him to remain bright, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I went back to it last week, and today I had my doubts; But in the end, everything went well."
He has been criticized – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival – for orchestrating his races too much, avoiding the world marathon stars, actually counting on hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering world records more than sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's abilities as a long-distance runner.
On Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. halfway.
Two elite Kenyan riders, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the lead disappeared.
With just over three miles to go, Gebrselassie made his final comeback to break away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by five minutes.
Kamathis came third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Kazakhstan-born Irina Mikitenko, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year with a seventh-time of 2:19:19.
England's Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone by winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She was unable to compete in Beijing because of a hypothetical back pain, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her personal best by almost five minutes in her third marathon.
She ran using a clever strategy, letting the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners gain a nice advantage, then passing them about 18 1/2 miles later.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya was third in 2:25:01.
In a City apart, Pride and the Trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its huge park, a few miles from the sunny, brilliant and giant Orlando, lies a quiet little town where pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first all-black town to be incorporated, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, the description she made in 1935, is no longer so easy to do today." The city of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, lots of guavas, two schools and no prison."
It has now become a pilgrimage city
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival held annually in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city she describes—has become touristy thanks to its inclusion in The Depression's Florida travel guide—era Federal Writers' Project—remains a place apart.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was in the '30s, when Hurston said that Florida's rural black population was often reluctant to share their true thoughts with the white man, who "knowing us so little, doesn't know what he's losing."
Even though this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also invoked an open dialogue on the theme of race, many here remain cautious from the eyes of the foreigner.
"We're very careful about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and the city's longest-serving parishioner.
"It has to be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of a black takeover as well as a community of almost 2400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a focal point but also an example of black Southern rural culture – sometimes scorned, others acclaimed – reminiscent of the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
Interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, whom everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heartfelt books full of dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this city, located just off Route 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten central Florida that culminates in a chapter of black history and human drama.
Bold as a bass drum in life and literature, Hurston led readers to the owned store of Eatonville's first mayor, Mr. Joe Clarke, which was later divided into several private parts.
"Past the road on the left," she writes, "you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its gardens and well-preserved playgrounds that Howard Miller has always cared for, although he can barely read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can be used by people passing through.
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor was not like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone enjoyed.
Zora described the reality well," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's young daughters whom Hurston immortalized, citing the colorless songs, performed by men who praised their beauty.
She added: "Some people didn't like it."
Hurston is still remembered as a lively and eccentric person, who returned frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning in a big Chevrolet with a cigarette in his mouth and pants here, where even today people are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many mocked her.
"People were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he further adds, swinging in his chair on the back patio overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the '20s, she was buried in a grave of some kind, at Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no major commemorations, nor plaque for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or legacy she offered to the world," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County public officials wanted to move a five-lane highway into the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community's two-lane main street.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made as Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 50s, the dispute over the mixing of races led hatred to the doors of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of young white people would throw oranges or objects at the people sitting on the side," Franklin said.
" One lady even died. "
They threw a watermelon from their car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorifying of my race".
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, while positive in some aspects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened the confidence of young people.
"Black children used to be kissed - I remember this well - we kissed our master in the morning, and in the evening too," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and chief director of the Eatonville Community Safeguard, a non-profit group.
This lasted, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white — I mean there's a cultural dividing line here," Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, by the way, created space for many more Zora Neale Hurston—black writers, actors, and artists who went beyond the prejudice, like herself, armed with a joyful self-confidence and guidelines such as, "How can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
It's beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited the unmarked grave in Hurston and began struggling to revive its reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a true bestseller, reintroduced it to the American canon.
The highway project came just as Eatonville's most famous girl had regained her appeal.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors see her as a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the festival's inauguration two years later, and many return in January, to commemorate it.
After many years, the county rejected the highway proposal.
"The fiasco of the five-lane motorway, extremely fast, a real civic pride," said Melle. Nathiri.
Miss Boyd summed it all up stating that "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been listed as a historic town since 1998.
A mono-themed library (obviously renamed Hurston) opened in 2006, on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, repaved.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a back street on a rainy summer day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent black today)
Outsiders who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its raison d'être, are still treated with caution.
You have to ask permission for most interviews, and some things—like the walls of the old church in Eatonville, painted by the white man, depicting black men in the fields—don't have to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a courageous teacher with a soft spot for bright red, are still afraid that their island community will be well understood.
However, with the expansion of the Hurston Festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular tend to view Eatonville as Hurston viewed his entire race: beautiful, problematic and all, no better or worse, but as proud, creative, bossy, crazy and mixed as other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is genuine civic affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or for the police force, which needs additional forces.
And even for the youngest, like Winter Park twins 11-year-old Alondra and Alexia Kenon, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
"Most people who pass through this area will think, 'Oh, this city has nothing compared to others,'" Alondra Kenon said after mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, all of them speak finance fluently.
Still, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosk and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they're in the eye of the storm.
They could never think that in the glass-comb offices above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst "office day" since the crack of 1929.
Delivery drivers continue to squeeze onto the sidewalks, with their carts and trays of muffins for morning meetings.
Latinos still hang out between residential buildings wearing, like mules, fifty luxurious shirts hanging from a yoke placed on his shoulders.
Office workers continue to line up to buy their morning sandwiches from street vendors, and it's still impossible to find a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
I hadn't felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic narratives until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work in the late afternoon, because I discovered at my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, about twenty people queuing.
Not in front of the tellers' counters, nor to withdraw cash or make a payment, but in front of the customer service counter, where regular customers ordered their checkbooks, tourists asked for directions to the Macy store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "authorized personal banker," were all lining up for the same reason I did.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a construction company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that operate only in one state, and who say they treat customers like their family.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with a capital of $ 327 has resorted to the trustee of bankruptcy, and while the New Yorkers returned home for the weekend this Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with savings accounts worth $ 440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and store employees in front of me, frightened of another potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable to them, the one that does the most bailouts on Wall Street.
Nonsensital New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I could hear a lady at my local Chinese supermarket talking on the phone about Lehman Brothers, the bank that failed, and its meagre chief executive Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she might have had for criticizing a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed janitor at my building, changed the topic of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or deliveries from my produce vendor.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings into the money market for money market funds.
"I've changed, I don't want to take any risks."
Memoirs of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Music director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was supposed to include those under 21, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed shape according to mythology) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to handle any type of music presented to it, whether madrigal or messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself".
He is said to have said: "The composer knows what he wants"
It's all there, in the music.
So sing!"
His wand technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver were to be knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he was conducting the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I've seen over a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me – and, sometimes, they've even inspired me.
Tod Handley held this combination of greatness and personal modesty so rarely.
He hated drivers who, according to him, "only focus on certain people".
He will be missed by many.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (who died September 25) states that "in 1946 he resumed his studies in economic history at Oxford and in 1950 became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while doing a BSc, MA and PhD."
This is what comes from Woodruff's letter in Beyond Nab End, but it is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was Professor of Economic History at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastics industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
In the 50s and 51s in the United States, he studied at the Norman Hops, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
Why Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria swings to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who has abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization of "cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs depicting mosques striped red.
Police accuse far-right extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the weekend of the victory of far-right political parties in the country's general election.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning; According to the police, this is an organized action.
The offenders painted Jewish symbols such as the Star of David on several graves; Detectives believe, however, that this could have been done to disguise extremists' sense of hatred towards Muslim immigrants.
Could this accident somehow be related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said it was "deeply shocked" at news of the desecration, which comes just during the religious month of Ramadan, which is coming to an end.
Austria is seriously considering regaining its courage, following its rightward swing in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that won almost 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, waged an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the Freedom Party leader who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burkas, and even voiced opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, claiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out just after the elections defined the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because they were worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is banned from travelling abroad.
Courts have banned glamorous rock star Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he told the authorities under his control of his intention to travel to Spain via the France.
Police in Kent issued the travel ban last Thursday after proving Glitter's guilty child sexual abuse to magistrates.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing at the Ashford Courts of Limited Jurisdiction, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford Magistrates' Court, Kent Police requested an app to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present then."
Glitter, 64, informed authorities that he wanted to go abroad, even if it meant being included in the list of accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not report his movements to the authorities, he could serve up to five years in prison.
Kent police said they would not discuss specific cases or Glitter's potential movements in the county.
A spokesman for Kent Police said: "Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect our children as well as those overseas.
"In our view, it is easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because we have arrangements that can handle any potential risks, much more effectively.
"Protecting the people of Kent is Kent Police's most cherished intention, and we are closely monitoring the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the area, to minimise potential risks to the public."
. Glitter returned to the UK last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, aged 10 and 11, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok from where he should have boarded a flight to London.
But he declared that he was not feeling well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him at passport control, and in the end, he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry to their territory, and was therefore forced to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport's Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to Uxbridge Limited Court, West London, to register him on Scotland Yard's list of accused of sexual abuse.
In the past, Glitter had already served a four-month sentence in the UK, for possessing child abuse images.
An Interior Ministry source said Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter had been banned from travel to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master off stage to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no gift clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to achieve the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand the artist.
On the other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in these moments unknown to the general public, where we discover intimate gestures and stolen looks artists who do not care to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of some staging with singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser-known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer takes up the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of the Flemish Month of Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting passion, sadness, joy on stage ... captivating the audience.
To capture moments of personality of these artists it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
They have a personality and a character of their own.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera moments of personality of flamenco stars".
With the festival "Chant populaire des Mines", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and equipment, recall classic photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classical side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not about the dance or the song per se, but about the personality and character of the artist who captivates the audience with his art.
The search for the essential and the magic has been the constant of this work that is presented these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Flamenco stars like Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy artists photographed.
The project has turned into a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book of collections of portraits exhibited at the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of Old Sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph the portrait of people, to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a more or less long time.
I believe that in photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters that sometimes you do not know or who leave you only a few minutes to be able to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco entitled "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the El Fotómata Gallery, located at number 20 Calle de la Mata (street parallel to the Poplar Garden of Hercules) which will be open until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he is writing is "real audacity"
The novel is set in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project he is working on, a novel that stars Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The favorite for the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday at the Hay festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies him "is a real audacity" and that "everything shows that he should not write it".
"If I were reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the four-day festival for the exchange of ideas and thoughts, which for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people parade through the city of the aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize with a majority of the participants' votes, was sold out at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, found himself in front of a fascinated audience that did not see the past hour during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote in a "very methodical way" through intense documentation work, correcting and rewriting part of the text to cope with his "lack of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspire his novels.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books are life-changing. "But I refuse to believe that literature is pure amusement, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less alike," because writers have been asked "not to indulge in frivolity" and to assume their vocation.
Bad weather spoils the Pozoblanco fair
The banderilles festival that concluded the bull races of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the toreadors on horseback checked that the arena was impassable.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather was fierce on this fair, since finally two out of three parties could not take place.
On Saturday it was rain that prevented the celebration of the second bull race planned.
On the bill were José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who should have faced each other in the Castilblanco bullring.
Thus only the Friday party took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and was carried in triumph, after making arm movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banderilles planted on the back of the bull and a severed ear that the uncovered stands applauded more than his fight itself with the bull.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the bullring of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
During his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whistled by most of the public.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hashish found
Five o'clock minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the police of Euskadi (l'Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón (Alava).
Police officers arrested two occupants of a van and the two fled.
Its loading, more than two tons of hashish, enough to stop them.
The police pursued them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A.J., according to information disclosed by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was charged with drug trafficking and falsification of documents.
The incident took place when various officials of the Traffic Unit of Alava were carrying out a check of vehicles on the N-1, at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly accelerated and the control began.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers further on the side of the road, where the two occupants descended to flee into a wooded area.
Basque police eventually arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were transporting and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with bales of hashish. Then they transferred him to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drugs.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate had been "forged" since it did not coincide with the one written on the van's registration document, which is also why they charged the detainee with the crime of falsifying documents.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape, and to determine the source of the seized drugs.
The detainee, 28-year-old A.A.J., was taken into custody to carry out the various procedures and will be tried in the hours that follow.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of medication
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda from the TV series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw her make strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, a spokesperson for the California Police Patrol revealed to People magazine.
The witness said that around 4:30 p.m., Locklear "pressed the accelerator hard, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going in reverse several times, she rolled on her sunglasses."
Shortly after, the witness, who at first did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and got out of her vehicle.
This person, at that time, called emergency services because "he was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She looked disoriented," which is why officers took her to the drug and alcohol center for testing.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was ruled out from the start, although "based on police officers' observation at first glance, we thought Locklear was under the influence of medication."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was incarcerated around 7.00pm and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was discharged from the Arizona clinic where she was interned to treat a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares urged the Andalusian Federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The General Coordinator and Deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is up to the regional federation to make a decision on the case of the former Councilor of Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of carrying out preferential treatment to members of his family.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said of the behavior of the political party he will have to adopt in the Seville City Council.
However the leader of the United Left asked that the investigations show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva may have committed: "The United Left has always defended this kind of case so that they have a maximum degree of transparency."
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all civil servants".
"Sangre de Mayo", Garci's daring bet
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in "Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly 15 million euros budget.
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film with a duration of more than two and a half hours "Sangre de mayo" will be released in cinemas next Friday, which will then become a TV series for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci claims to have realized with this shoot "a childhood dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him, three years ago, to shoot a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May 2 in Madrid, something he always accepted when the story was confined to national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Municipality of Madrid constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain that was the wrong leader for the fight, since, the struggle for independence led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained financing as for the films "Captain Alastrar" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double that obtained for "Sangre de mayo" - because he could not shoot some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated for most of his career.
The filmmaker of "Volver a empezar" has influenced his usual way of working, the staging of the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting filming and to whom he does not cast, since it seems to him "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater and the cinema to keep informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de mayo" rehearse in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
A four-time Oscar nominee (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy "Sangre de mayo", "Seven French pool tables" and finally the winner, "Blind Sunflowers", are not representative of young Spanish cinema, "which deserves to be better known", he said.
With this film Garci does not expect a price.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, then you realize you're only working for prosperity, and now you're just making one more film," Garci says after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón puts herself in the shoes of the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer will pay tribute to a dancer who is also Sevillian.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and at the age of three went to live in London with her family.
She was a free dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer of women's liberation, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who marked the history of dance in Europe between the two world wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she asked me to play the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell his life but to translate his way of thinking.
The titles of his dances made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" made me think of a Cuban folk dance and "the snake dance" of some tangos.
Her dancing was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to hers," she says.
The staging was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabela again in one of his shows, as he did in "La puerta abierta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who was exceptionally willing to collaborate with his student.
"Matilde transforms Tórtola into a mature character.
I am happy because she has agreed to play a role in my work and that honors me."
The staging was also done thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were considered divas".
This work also recounts, in a way, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in such distant places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think these are the women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows and highlights her work," Bayón said.
The show will start at 8:30 pm at the Lope de Vega Theater
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition 'Flamenco and Life' because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They caught my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they convey and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
The publication of the "Diary of a recently married poet" concludes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Recently Married Poet" in the Church of Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium" (2006-2008),  organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the "Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium" comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This Poplar of Light" that was inaugurated last May and which,  after traveling to the different Andalusian provinces, will go to New York during the International Congress.
In the same way, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia has bought eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Recently Married Poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America pleases less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was one of them."
This sentence is from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of Malic", and illustrates the despair of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He struggled to get an Oscar
He had not toured since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a blow to everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country have been better because of his existence."
No one was afraid to make themselves ridiculous or exaggerate.
One of the fathers of cinema and the homeland died during a particularly dark period, when terrorists and stock markets are scary, the esteem of Americans has fallen very low, desperately looking for reasons for dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, human beings are left with admiration and you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of his elder who died from an overdose and the creation of his own brand of organic food.
It was a victory for a country that struggled to prevail against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winner Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy who arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He set the bar high for us," said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who tries to break through the screen as Paul Newman did: by being very honest and having a serious private life and far from the objectives.
It's still not easy or possible in the media jungle these days.
But there is the one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even if he did not lack the opportunities not to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger outside my home, if I have steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly attends his daughters meeting his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, he was never prouder than that of the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and philanthropist," they say.
Madrid in the race to host the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can host Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, it could come true in 2016.
But I wonder if we are ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but in my opinion it was the worst race I've ever been in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be the subject of an eliminatory score.
But let's look at everything in detail and from the beginning.
Mistakes start with the withdrawal of bibs, which forces you to go early.
This is not bad but if they make you move it would be better if they give you everything (including the microchip for shopping).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the bib (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the size ' S ' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need a size XL)
What kind of world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small jerseys with less fabric and therefore cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on race day.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to remove the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and assaults of the shack took place.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, will not even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me that I think did not mark the start correctly.
Of course, if they asked me to give an example of a perfect race, this one would not occur to me.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympics.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Emerging Technologies Conference, Microsoft was presented a new system for image recognition and human interaction, a species of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in Microsoft's case, a shuttle to get around the company's campus) in response to what it was asked during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a pattern and face recognition system, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who they are – including remembering what positions they hold – and listen to and hear the key words of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking with her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks him if she is here to visit someone and tells him that she will answer him in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course this represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the essentials instead of useless applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change in strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system is losing importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome came to the network, I was one of those who bought into the theory that Google Chrome is Google's first move to compete with Windows.
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not a functioning system.
The operational system will always be necessary since it is the indispensable basis for the hardware and software to understand each other.
He holds the same position as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear but we must see the "death" of the operational system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed that idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system and more and more to the Internet browser.
We turn on the computer only to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who is the use of half of the applications supplied with the system?
Who can do more can do less.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, far fewer than Vista.
Less heavy, less crowded, less complex.
For the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need that, indeed, and I will show you an example.
The photo in this article was taken earlier this month in one of Microsoft's employee break rooms in Redmond.
On the beverage vending machine, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week there was a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released in early 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will surely try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But with the launch of Android being late and the iPhone already on the market, it will cost them dearly.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's ' Blood Diamond, as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the outfit of the muscular gay association.
And if we start listing all his appearances, we could also mention this mustachioed burly man who lifted weights in a traveling circus.
It's not just a simple, tight-fitting, sleeveless men's undershirt.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out among all the others.
First of all, by its flamboyant name - although it is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with the sport since it takes the name, according to legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The ' Marcel ' is distinguished from the others by its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive logo and the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the most famous undershirts have in the neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tank tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Although it is a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
Second assault for Honda's super sales
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had good roominess, this new monovolume has an even larger interior space.
Added to this are some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
Thus it is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz has a very similar line to the previous model, the changes introduced in this MPV are numerous.
Among them there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before looking at the new model, it should be pointed out that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the first generation was put on the market.
First of all, we observe that Honda has renovated this model in a shorter time than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe the Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a sales phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case of Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most marketed car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less a million cars sold in six years represents is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it expects to sell 100,000, which would represent a sales growth of 17% on the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The Spanish subsidiary hopes to sell 2,000 Jazz in one year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely compensate for the decline in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the brand's managers hope to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 fewer cars than in 2007, a drop in sales of 16%.
Thanks to this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to achieve a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get that market share when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a five-door hybrid with a compact size - 4.37 meters in length - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars per year worldwide.
Depending on the market and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of the Insight's sales will be in the United States, while the remaining half will be divided between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first three months of next year, following its public presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change or 1.52 meters.
The dimensions increase and so does the interior space.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a fuel reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
In the same way, the trunk capacity - which has a double bottom system - can hold up to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity compared to the trunk of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 liters.
The other innovation - in addition to exterior elements such as the taillights or the panoramic roof - is the improvement of access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the rear doors of the first Jazz which opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of the Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will be equipped with two gasoline thrusters of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines feature i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2-liter engine develops a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This thruster - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 liters per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which on the previous generation reached 83 horsepower, now reaches 100 horsepower.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horsepower has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
"I want to become a young mother; The candidate doesn't worry me."
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters are taking their new activity in fashion very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new headquarters but as well as at the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
A very intense but, at the same time, exciting day awaits us.
What is the basis for your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s enchants us and we are inspired by it for our collections.
I really like to walk around town and observe women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you are a very versatile woman: aren't you?
I think so, but at the end of the day it all comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was very little I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to look in my aunt's cupboards and to see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of the way I dressed.
The dancers really like to dress well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you put on the clothes, that's when you really put yourself in the shoes of the character.
So, everything is connected.
You had not long ago 30 years: was it hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30 years make me happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with fewer problems.
The biological clock does not scare me.
I've done all the things I wanted to do since I was a little girl and it gave me a lot of internal happiness.
So, are you thinking of becoming a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mother because my body asks me to do so and, moreover, I want to become a young mother; I don't want to lose that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's come to the cinema, you're waiting for the different films you shot last year to come out.
That's right, I can't wait for them to come out.
As a woman from the theater, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I can't wait for the films 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' to come out.
Let's see what you think...
A few days ago you started on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't go on the catwalk to model.
Quite simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I have known her for quite some time, to invite me to participate in London in a charity parade for her association in favor of supporting women and the clothes we were showing off - I showed two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold at auction to raise money for Naomi's NGO.
People that Naomi is a soft-hearted person.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things are not true.
In addition, this good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to march for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the headstand, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the Third World.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
It's called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision avoidance technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Center made the small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, the BR23C represents the rise of Nissan's safety shield.
This robot will allow the brand's vehicles to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space in an oval shape that closely resembles the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing are the composed eyes of the bee, able to see at an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption inside its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers developed what is known as a laser range finder.
It detects obstacles that are within a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"The moment it detects an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by branching off its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If this were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," says Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Displacement Laboratory and lead engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted upwards or downwards, or diagonally; It can only move in two dimensions and according to what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
"Every second this device must only process information and act on this data.
It does not need to retain the information or intuitive logic of prior maneuvers, which is why it can run continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
It may come as a surprise, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes."
This represents the first bus to develop new instant collision avoidance technologies, a technology that will be introduced in production cars in a decade according to Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device on a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles on the road.
Repeat drink-driving offenders will have to install the 'alcolock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcohol, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting drunk, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and it now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last one year.
Its goal is the rehabilitation of the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State for Road Safety but also the Directorate General for Road Safety and the Technological Institute Foundation for Automotive Safety will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists stopped for driving more than once drunk take back the car.
The alcolock would avoid this since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the breath and prevents starting the vehicle if the driver does not blow before; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is the responsibility of the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced violations by up to 65% in the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year.
This measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with such behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be carried out by ordinary means, but, nevertheless, reform made by penal means requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some commercial and company vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative by the Spanish Socialist Party which proposes to install this system in school buses, as was done in France.
In Mexico without peep-toes
At 5:40 p.m. precisely, the official time scheduled, the plane of the Spanish Air Force in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling landed in the Presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez Airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve of sunset but its rays still required you to put your hand as a visor to be able to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours before I had asked the taxi driver in the street if he was aware that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to finish their official journey.
- Ah, very well, so we will not be able to go to the airport to pick up customers at this time ... Are you from here or so...?
"No, no sir, I'm Spanish but I lived here thinking for two years.
- Ah, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
Several of them are waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and in a military row of 27 naval soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, as for her, has her hair in the wind, is dressed very soberly and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; Maybe they had told him a thunderstorm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before passing into the room where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny journalist from Mexican television is waiting for them.
They are afraid of being mortgaged
It must be recognized that the Treasury of the United States, besides having a lot of cash to make plans, is not devoid of geniuses.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to fail: ' Bad Credit Hotel '.
That is to say 'the Hotel of bad credits' ... or stories.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Maître d'Hôtel leads us to think several times if it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it.
Of course, this game gives useful information but little detail.
It's more of a teen game.
What to do if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's unthinkable to buy a house
The most prestigious award in fashion
There is surely no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion award than Paris and there is surely no living cartoonist more extraordinary and good live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in the Mango window at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she cried almost with emotion.
Admittedly, it is the second largest store of the brand in Europe which has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first store is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the competition, made that we found ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the extraordinary Chagals family as a table next to it, the presidential table prepared by Mango looked even more spectacular.
Having big on her heart and making good luck, because of the recent death of her brother, Nati put on a Mango garment and some ELAH finery, which took her breath away, and arm in arm with her son Luis – a handsome man almost two meters tall – she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, and Baron de Rotchil ended the evening without a jacket because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who came to the store with trousers and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner transformed herself into a sexy black long dress, was moved when during the night tour of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballets rehearsal room and remembering the good old days,  She grabbed one of the bars and made the gesture of a 'big folded'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the dependencies of the palace, but she showed us before on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another handsome man who travels by motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and having asked beforehand, that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to top it off, they're all listed in a book that will bring booksellers some relaxation on September 30.
The alarm clock almost saddens us when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it's even worse when we think about the hectic pace that life imposes on us today.
The office is synonymous with tension and the computer with back pain.
Stress is the evil of the twenty-first century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But 1001, neither one more nor one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to the taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is entitled '1001 Ways to Relax' and will arrive at booksellers directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in places like work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' belies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline isn't running through your veins to restore balance to your body and stress has become an issue, it's time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talking while sleeping
Some children talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very awake telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who talk in their sleep.
The first time it happens it may surprise you, but in reality it doesn't matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep called somniloquia.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course, there is more than one who speaks during the night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its occurrence
They are often linked to other sleep alterations such as nightmares, night terrors, bedwetting or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have already said before, they can also be associated with very high fevers, stressful situations or overexcitement.
In any case, it is a little-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also highly variable.
It may be that he speaks with a small quiet voice, with isolated words, whispers or on the contrary with cries, tears, long speeches ...
In the event that somniloquy becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to get an explanation for this problem.
We have said that it is a benign alteration, which is why there is no treatment unless it is related to another sleep alteration that can be cured (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore look for quiet games and avoid programs or television series that are more or less violent.
With children who are very nervous and have trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as somniloquies appear try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It is useless since he is unconscious and you would wake him up.
Even if he talks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not usual), do not be tempted to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because when he sleeps, he is not conscious so he can organize his thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so be careful how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can question them at night to find out their secrets.
Not even in jest.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, do not worry, this is nothing too bad, it is an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... Finally
Illhaeusern finally found the way to victory on his home field after a long period of scarcity.
Without having a great match, the Yellow and Blacks created the greatest number of chances and managed to convert one for the win of the match.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting where the attackers had trouble expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visiting captain Kauffmann who came close to the window on a shot from distance, Illhaeusern would take the lead slightly and in turn Fonderflick from distance, then with Hirn above, Romain with the tip of the foot or Diebold came to tickle the defense of Dannemarie.
Opposite, we blocked in midfield and we just left the stirring Riahi at the forefront of the attack.
The beginning of the second half would be decisive with first two chances signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousiens by Marais, well positioned to recover a ball pushed back on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the striker Illhousiens will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates outnumbered.
But Dannemarie will not know how to take advantage of it and will not pose big problems to an illhousien Eleven who just backed up a little to "compact" his defense, except in the very last seconds of play when, after a big mess, the ball passed very close to the crossbar.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour to Brittany.
Faced with the show of force of fishermen who strongly disrupted Monday the access to several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in Finistère, to meet their representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he "will come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general assembly of the "crisis committee" created by Breton fishermen to obtain measures in the face of soaring diesel prices, which reached a record at more than 1.14 euros per liter on average.
According to Elysee spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them the solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of seafarers".
Nicolas Sarkozy is eagerly awaited by fishermen.
Tuesday morning, they conducted snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing traffic jams of nearly 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon was also blocked, but the links to Belle-île not stopped.
A filtering dam has been put in progress on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors have already shown Monday their determination by burning, at dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where trawlers remained docked, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the movements of commercial vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Le Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important Total refinery of Donges.
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must indeed decide Tuesday on the follow-up to be given to the movement and its participation in the meeting scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the national fisheries committee, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishermen will not give up" and "do not wish to move to Paris," announced for example Liliane Cariou, the president of the fisheries committee of Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay tax on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but they estimate that the break-even point of a boat is only reached with diesel below EUR 0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" singer died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes greeted the film legend and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery guidance for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft to be delivered this year despite the threat of recession hanging over the global economy.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, is maintaining its delivery forecast for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer has high hopes for the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft in the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG is reportedly considering divesting more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which the US monetary authorities have bailed out, plans to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $ 85 billion that has been advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and its retirement business in the United States, says the newspaper which cites sources close to the file.
AIG's board met on Sunday evening to consider possible divestitures, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG plans to divest include its air leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59 percent stake in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the FT added.
No final decision has been taken on these divestitures, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly build liquidity to repay the loan of 85 billion granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of seeing the US authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders proportionately.
Analysis Paris History of the session Morning Meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange fell to a historic level on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to rescue banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged 777.68 points to 1O,365.45.
In terms of points, the biggest drop in its history (684.81 points) was previously recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the resumption of trading after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The tech-dominated Nasdaq index fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index 8.81% (or 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points, according to final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the bank rescue plan that was to restore some stability on the markets.
By 228 votes to 205, the representatives denied Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two in three Republicans rejected his plan.
"This is a bad signal to the market, which sees Congress unable to pass a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market was counting on this plan," she added, fearing that a draft adopted in several days would come "too late".
"If the project is indeed moribund (...) then the baton will be passed quickly to the Fed and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the downfall of a financial institution" in the United States, Piegza said.
After the collapse of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, prompting emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing "not just an American crisis, but a global crisis", added the FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 3.632%, from 3.827% late Friday, and the 30-year to 4.161%, from 4.357% the previous day.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the entry into its round table of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's largest bank, which will pay nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a news welcomed by a sharp decline in its share price.
A week after unveiling a tentative settlement, the two banks said MUFG would buy 9.9 percent of Morgan Stanley common stock at a price of $25.25 per share, for a total of $3 billion.
The price retained is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as at August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible securities with a yield of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of $29, 28 percent above its current price.
Morgan Stanley shares, however, lost 6.79% to $ 23.07 around 17:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to banking holding status," said John Mack, chief executive of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow it to diversify its activities but puts it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday further show that the agreement has been modified in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $ 8.5 billion.
"A week ago," Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG's chief executive, told Tokyo, "we thought the stake would consist entirely of ordinary shares.
But given the current state of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and hedge ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20% of earnings per share.
Under the agreement, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into common shares in one year if they trade more than 50% above the conversion price, or approximately $47, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group, however, declined to give details on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to post a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "significantly" lightened its balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been trying for the group, which has seen its share price halve while the cost of insurance against a risk of default on its debt soared.
This cost fell on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of the big Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised $ 15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, Monday.
Rebuilding the republic around the socialism of the twenty-first century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, it is the third who put to the vote a draft of a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results of 80% of the vote.
According to these results the "no" won 28%, 7% of the vote was void and 0.7% were blank votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two exit polls and a count by a non-governmental organization announced a large victory for the "yes" vote, placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed in the night from Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly," he said, congratulating Ecuadorians at the headquarters of the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place peacefully according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), focused on a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft Constitution enshrines the power of the State over the economy, reserving to it the "development planning" of a country living essentially from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the currency sent by its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the bill also grants enhanced powers to the Head of State, who will be able to serve up to two consecutive four-year mandates and will have the possibility of dissolving the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek re-election in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to introduce in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US anti-drug operations.
Obama, winner on points in the first televised duel
Friday's first debate between the two White House candidates was followed by another over whether John McCain or Barack Obama won.
Not surprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
Gallup, whose poll published Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% against McCain's 44%), believes that it is the Democrat who has pulled out of the game.
Among undecided voters, who matter, Obama emerged victorious for 39 percent of respondents, while 25 percent gave McCain victory, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead Thursday with the expected good performance of his running mate, Joseph Biden, in the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She has good instincts," Clinton said over the weekend.
The septuagenarian McCain has constantly highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while stressing the "naivety" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused repeatedly.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the knowledge to be president," he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without dismantling, he was concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still has not understood, while Obama has," retorted this weekend a Democratic spot blaming the Republican for not having taken the full measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American of the street".
"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama denounced yesterday before 20,000 people gathered for a campaign rally in North Carolina in the pouring rain.
He didn't even say the words 'middle class' or 'workers.'" The financial rout clearly benefits Obama, who is seen by Americans as the most likely to save the economy on the brink.
"The coming week could be a turning point," said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a Clinton administration veteran, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle "is the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reaffirming that he would still manage to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the ups and downs of Wall Street, the Illinois senator also pointed out that achieving the country's eventual energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, along with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain wanted to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Cautious, the two candidates dodged questions about the financial rescue plan of $ 700 billion (470 billion euros) adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you notice that there was an election?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated Sunday night in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislative elections.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening as soon as polling stations closed in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people came to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some admit they didn't even vote: "What's the point, since they'll do what they want with my voice," says one young person.
They do not believe that the regime that has put on a good face to foreign observers in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including visa bans for 40 Belarusian leaders and asset freezes, could be lifted if the elections are considered clean by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the count," said Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change," said Alexander Milinkievitch, a former opposition presidential candidate in 2006 and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the votes, and here is the executive power.
If opposition MPs enter parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and proposals for laws."
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "we must start dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the electoral process, will recognize the validity of the vote.
She stresses that turnout figures seem too high and that the generalisation of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the door to all manipulations.
"You noticed there was an election, did you? asks Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those best suited to power."
The silence of the night falls on the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched an assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back safely to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were freed by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently fit, the hostages arrived around 3:30 p.m. aboard a special plane at the al-Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, in helicopters to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examinations.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been tossed from one cache to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous agency, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 special forces personnel, flown in two helicopters, launched the assault overnight just before dawn.
"An exchange of fire occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fleeing," said the official, who requested anonymity.
He said a total of 150 Egyptian special forces members of the "lightning" unit had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned from Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men in the secret service, special forces," he said, without elaborating.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have intercepted during a patrol a 4x4 vehicle carrying the kidnappers, killing six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army claimed they were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Unity (SLA-U), which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the funding of culture is making headlines and occupying this election campaign.
Good.
But a sector of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will stand up and denounce the misery that is being given to small museums, archives, archaeological digs or national historic sites that are starving?
What politician will dare remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros on the restoration of the only castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Among our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and this, in concert.
In Quebec, at the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers in 211 historical, heritage, archival and genealogy societies are concerned with excavating history, preserving piles of private archives with three cents and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when developers and decision-makers launch their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a forum for history and heritage?
The interview - Blood back to safety
Yesterday, Héma-Québec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, it regained the public trust that had been seriously shaken by the tainted blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, the national blood supply managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service was contaminated with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In response to this tragedy and public discontent, the Government of Canada instituted a public inquiry, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, in February 1994 to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to ensure that such a disaster does not happen again.
While Justice Krever was slow to table his report, some provinces then set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mandate.
As a result of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and Canadian Blood Services to supply all the other provinces and the two territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Québec," recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through efforts to improve the safety of blood products and fieldwork in the years that followed, we regained the public's trust," she says, before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of Quebecers now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, there was an outbreak in Europe of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says the one that has held the fort since its foundation in 1998.
"And we had no idea if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
We then relied on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know it and a serious disease can result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, we introduce exclusion measures.
In April 1999, blood was therefore refused to persons who had been in the United Kingdom for more than one month since 1980.
However, a few years ago, it was demonstrated beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted through blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle that we applied made sense."
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique for HIV testing appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (NAT), which detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus itself and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until then were based.
TANs have shortened the silent period, which extends between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period was reduced to less than one week.
This has substantially reduced the risk that some donors will be infected without knowing it and cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, it means that it will take 12 million blood products before someone becomes infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission through a blood product occurs.
I believe that we can now feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to regain health," said Héma-Québec's CEO.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
Just last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on Reunion Island, which, like West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant," continued Dr. Décary, before emphasizing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient supply.
"The needs are increasing because the population is aging.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a recharge of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has consequences on the blood donor network, which on average includes only 3% of Quebecers eligible to donate blood."
Any healthy person aged 18 and over who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of people who donate blood are not accepted, for example because they have AIDS or malaria, and if they have travelled to a malaria-affected country, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With this 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But we need to renew the members of this donor network as they age and can no longer donate blood.
It is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but especially to retain them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today's life is so hectic, we rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood, "laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for burn victims.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Québec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered biomedical waste is full of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousandth cord blood sample and we plan to collect more than a thousand per year.
We should start offering them for transplants early next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed not to be able to access it" because Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - The Impact in the semifinals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semifinal round of the USL First Division Playoffs, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 total goal) victory over the Seattle Sounders yesterday in the second and decisive game of the quarterfinal series in total goals at Stade Saputo.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute.
After a scoreless first half on both sides, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other goals for Montreal.
Roger Levesque was the only one to outsmart Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
In the first game of the home-and-away series on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder overcame a 3-1 deficit in the second leg to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still advanced to the semifinal round 5-4 on aggregate.
The Impact is scheduled to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but series details will be confirmed today.
At a glance - Kovalev's winning goal
The number one trio of the Canadiens is ready to start the season.
The unit of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the attack in a 3-2 shootout win over the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the game, scored a goal, Plekanec had two assists, and Kovalev had an assist in the win, the Habs' fourth in six preseason games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal of the shootout.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to do too much in the first period," said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He got a great ovation."
Charest bets on the North
Prime Minister does not rule out calling an election before the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal Party's general council ended, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, in Quebec City, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to be elected in today's by-election.
"Pushing back the limits of our last great northern frontier": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in broad outline, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a kind of Image Mill.
Spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec as seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc. were looped on three huge screens.
Great means as in an election period.
In a press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would call the election this fall, even though he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been presented.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel with immense potential", but did not give a deadline, investment amounts, or specific priorities for future projects.
At most, a few avenues of what could be developed further: in particular hydroelectricity, forestry, but especially the mining sector, boosted by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond," according to Mr. Charest's list.
This "territory twice the size of France", "is our home, it is in Quebec.
Not only is it home, but it is in us," he insisted, as if to show that he was soliciting a national founding myth.
Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after pausing theatrically to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the premier at the press briefing.
"This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and, when the opportunity arises, I reiterate this position on behalf of the government," he said.
Moreover, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said of the Northwest Passage, which will open year-round due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the people of the territory, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former PQ MP for Ungava), have already begun consultations with some thirty communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a major meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "we will give ourselves a common vision".
The development of the North would be consistent with the principles of sustainable development.
The Plan Nord will be "concerted, orderly and respectful of the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of Liberal premiers who preceded him.
"Like the Liberals who came before us, we thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a large cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Generating Station as the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party has forged the future," said Jean Charest.
In a press conference, he invoked another reference, conservative this one, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest noted that its commissioning was scheduled for 2012.
"It's between us there, but I plan to be there," he told his activists, eliciting loud applause from them.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling an election this fall, which the law allows him to do.
He points out that his schedule is however fulfilled, including a mission of the Council of the Federation to China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend's General Council provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that passed like a letter in the mail: the QLP is calling in particular for the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and that they have a veto over decisions made in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the broad outlines of the Plan Nord were met with skepticism.
PQ leader Pauline Marois highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, gave up on applying it.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today," commented Ms. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (election that takes place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supports the adoption of a Plan Nord by the government.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - A disgraced country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of "Justice" (oh irony) in the Harper cabinet, who last summer allowed himself to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "disgrace" for Canada.
To cast aspersions on this woman who fought tirelessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says as much about the Prime Minister's entourage as it does about Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated its national locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the alleged offences.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, reneges on its word and allows a child soldier to languish in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a travesty of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
For the record, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, are advocating for Omar Khadr's repatriation so that he can receive a fair trial in Canada.
This is the same government that turns a blind eye to torture: it does not care that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of abuse.
We don't realize it yet, but we are currently witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", the word that Harper keeps brandishing and ringing so hollow in his mouth.
The time has come when no morality no longer exists: we can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen at the whim of a hitherto minority head of government (what will happen after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian speech
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice-President of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold company has filed a six-million-dollar defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small penniless publishing house in an effort to launch a "transparent public debate."
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation suits, but the law.
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.
For Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to its own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums of money preparing their defence and fighting, on very unequal terms, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mining company.
The tactic in these unequal struggles is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose an out-of-court settlement that will gag the opposition and frighten anyone who dares to look into the matter again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have presented its vision of the facts to public opinion.
Unlike many of the countries where Barrick Gold operates, debates in Canada are normally conducted through the exchange of ideas and not with batons.
It was therefore enough for the mining company to open its books, its files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust public opinion and rejects out of hand petitions and letters of support for the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can both call for a 'public' debate while at the same time disregarding the opinions of that same public?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word refers only to highly-paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; That is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even critics have a voice.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a SLAPP lawsuit (continuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a formal notice against the authors of Noir Canada urging them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's prosecution is a direct attack on academic freedom of research and the search for truth, which are essential to any democratic society.
It denies, en bloc, the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the wealthy corporations of this world in a country like Canada, or face repeated prosecution, who will be able to do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
It has a right of reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's outsized lawsuit makes it clear that, contrary to what it claims, it has no desire for transparent debate.
This is a loss for academia, as well as for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms to limit this kind of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republican and Democratic, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic bailout since the Great Depression of the '30s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
It provides in particular: better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right of scrutiny over the salaries paid to the managers of rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative at the negotiating table Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We have made great strides towards a deal that will be effective in the markets," said Bush Administration Representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done in such a way as to shield the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street," she said.
"That's the fundamental point: If we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and disruption to the daily lives of Americans will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had turned to a sprint in the last hours for fear of the effect that a new failure would have on the mood of investors.
The deadline we agreed was the opening of the markets this morning.
Late in the negotiations, the two candidates for the US presidential election were rather favorable to the agreement, without failing to express their dissatisfaction that we are forced to reach this extreme.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama took credit for adding certain provisions to the agreement, including the one to allow homeowners to keep their homes and the one on the salaries of executives of companies rescued by the state.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to be happy about.
But these measures are necessary," he said on US television.
Asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The outline I've read [shows] that this is something we're all going to have to digest and be able to move forward with.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy back with taxpayers' money the bad debts, risky assets and unsellable debts of US financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of subprime mortgages before spreading to other more widespread forms of credit securities (ABCP) and leading to a liquidity freeze and the collapse of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of elected Republicans who had derailed the first draft agreement, last week.
This impasse is believed to have been broken since Democrats accepted that some "toxic" assets of troubled companies should only be insured by the government, rather than bought.
In order to round off the odds for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added stating that if the government had to assume losses for five years with this program, it could implement new taxes to help it recover its stake.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of 250 billion to which can be added another 100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion is expected to be approved by another vote in Congress.
In exchange for its help, Washington will obtain stakes in rescued companies that will earn it dividends in case of profit and that it can sell when the turmoil is over.
The federal government will have the ability to delay foreclosure proceedings for homes attached to home loans covered by this plan, as well as set limits on compensation and severance pay to executives of affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to a vote in the House of Representatives today, and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite their best efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
Voices continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camp.
"Obviously, Washington doesn't hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one of taking advantage of taxpayers."
Leader of a small group in Congress dubbed "the caucus of skeptics," Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us to tell us: Congress is being asked not to rush and to carefully consider the way forward," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas said it was giving up on acquiring its shipwrecked competitor since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is among the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"This is not wasted money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In exchange, voting rights in the bank and influence are recovered.
This is precisely something that savers and households appreciate now that times are looking uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to be on track to nationalise another bank battered by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley, including more than 41 billion (75.5 billion US) in mortgages.
Spain's Santander bank said yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His azure-eyed beauty was for a long time his trump card, some would say his weakness.
Had he freed himself from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, sensitivity and a talent that flowed naturally will also have distanced him from the register of power that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
But what a great long-distance runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the boom years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more cautious in his acting, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the bursting of dramatic conventions.
Mixed bloods often make beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German-Jewish father and a Hungarian-born mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, ultimate mark of quality.
Because in him was projected a whole country in love with the self-made man, the fighter of the Pacific War, wounded in combat, who in the early 50s studied drama at Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theater, television, soon in the cinema.
This same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the racing driver who placed second in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979, coupled with a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappear with him the shadows of this secret, discreet, committed star, allergic to the bursts of show business, whose enigma we will not have quite pierced.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman made moviegoers dizzy this weekend, as his great roles clash on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of a constantly changing seventh American art parades through him.
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on a Hot Roof adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958, come back to jostle in memory.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled at his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all its promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, taken over after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic thug in the brilliant The Sting, Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
Bitter and vengeful billiards player in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he reprised the character on the return in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar out of nine nominations in 1987.
That face through the ages was him.
Him again.
The eras jostle through his career.
Young people know him especially through the cult Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen brothers.
With a final role as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the circle was complete.
Unlike several film legends who left the profession early on, Newman remained in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its splendour and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered, not without humor, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" judging his performances too strong.
The profession has not always been kind to the handsome Paul Newman to whom the roles fell for a long time all cooked in the beak.
However, he played less often the young first than the marginalized: neurotic, alcoholic, bastards or desperate, whose perfect features reflected the excesses and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known facets of his true modest sensibilities.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott to an overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
Among the rain of tributes that swept over Newman yesterday, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the late actor.
Beyond his career as a legend, also fades a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of the excesses of Hollywood.
We will have seen a lot of his doe enthroned on jars of vinaigrette, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging the process of rather bad taste, although gag at first.
The profits from these sales were nevertheless donated to his Foundation for Special Education.
Newman, rather than sitting on his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Model citizen, in short, and in addition.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Company manufacture in their invoice factory?
Hearings on the ongoing criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin shortly on 8 October.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, having caused particularly significant damage. Other charges were brought against them, such as forgery and use of forgery.
According to the prosecutor's office, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the services were justified by false invoices.
The money from the state and municipalities, about HUF 65 million in total, went on the one hand into the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other hand into the pockets of some people.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to receive the money from the subsidies obtained by issuing invoices for expenses, behind which no real service was provided and thus, the associations never respected their commitments.
According to the indictment, many of the invoices were fake.
For the latter, they obtained invoice books at the Józsefváros market, while they made the stamps in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that were to appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the province of the North of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the latter's testimony, he had to locate boarding houses and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model of which they made the other bills that they would submit, among others, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András Őri, who, according to our information, was mainly concerned with drafting the files necessary to obtain the subsidies.
During a "scouting tour", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place provided the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place, at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up in the name of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, which would later be called Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, was teeming with errors of form and substance.
A boarding house, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there. Yet the invoice mentioned one hundred and thirty customers.
Highly imaginative billers also went to excess, when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounts, neither the name of Jobb Jövőért nor that of the Hoppá appeared, according to information given to the prosecutor's office.
Győző Farkas, the company's manager, told the hvg.hu website that when the prosecutor's office summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew right away that they were forged documents.
"Our company name and tax number were placed in the wrong place on the stamp."
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that according to the bill, a hundred people stayed there, did not fit either, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
Zealous billers also did not inquire about Budapest travel agencies, which were part of their choice, but only organized trips abroad. Thus, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency.
In addition, as it appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while services concerning travel activities, whose destination is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices issued in the name of Hotel Révfülöp to the order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the company's services do not bear a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. In addition, hotel employees only issue printed invoices, while fake ones were written by hand.
The Public Prosecutor's investigation reveals that the "issuers" also made mistakes by mentioning as a service the transport of goods by road, which the company issuing the invoices could not carry out, since its profile was investment advice.
In addition, it is also for defects of form, such as inadequate types of invoices and false stamps, that invoices issued to the order of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and de Biztos Pont turned out to be false.
Just as in the case of the company Ravenna Bt. or the sports camp of Kunfehértó, both of which deny being the authors of the invoices issued in their name.
Nor did the counterfeiters pay attention to the fact that HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time when (in 2001) Fiatal Városért Egyesület's group was supposed to have a meal at their home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of the company denies having issued this invoice.
Deliberately issued invoices
Another category of billers is those who were fully aware that they were being asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapesttért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták group, issued an invoice to the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért, for the sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab Kft. was induced to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation and in 2003, issued invoices to the order of the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület Association, for an amount of approximately HUF five million, but no service was actually provided.
No financial movement took place either, since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but the organizations avoided mentioning it in their accounts.
The next category of bill-issuing companies is companies directly related to the accused.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the managing director of Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose registered office was in Budapest but where he could not be found, was Iván Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, this company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, this equipment was purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of that company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Iván Kubatov also allegedly sent documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued invoices to the order of the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and de Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he pocketed their counter-value.
It was precisely at the request of Iván Kubatov that Romanian masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In reality, none of these companies were operating, which the accused explains by the fact that they did not receive work.
He nevertheless made use of these companies, since at the request of Mr. Zsolt Szente, co-accused and draftsman of the deeds of foundation of the societies, he drew up invoices in their names, in the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as the associations Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
Kubatov gave organizations a total of 15 invoices, issued by the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, worth HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor's office believed that 10% of the sums indicated on the invoices as well as VAT went into Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to draw up fictitious invoices that were used as part of Biztos Pont's grant application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció Association and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért applied for a subsidy from the Socialist Party's charitable body, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They obtained this grant for an amount of twice HUF 500,000, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To prevent this from being known, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to the TMA.
Moreover, it was these invoices that were found during the search of Árpád Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
During the hearing, some of the accused will recount the method of manufacturing the invoices, as they had already done before the prosecutor's office previously.
What could be really interesting would be if the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil on the whole story.
So far, his confession is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell every detail, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether this is in his interest, or, possibly, the Socialists would have reached an agreement according to which in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would bear the blame alone.
Today, the latter is probably offended, since requests for his placement under house arrest, on the basis of a relaxation of his conditions of detention, continually fall on deaf ears.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of economic crimes that cannot be repaired, wander freely or at least wait at their own homes for the end of the proceedings. He does not have that possibility.
The psychology of one-upmanship: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the merchandise.
Neurology and economics researchers at New York University have succeeded in uncovering the neurological and economic basis of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be left behind in this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that is why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
This research attempted to draw up a neurological diagram of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played lotto, while the other group took part in a playful auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) process, the researchers analyzed the active brain domains of the experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could win money, but during the auction, an essential element of which is the outbidding of a third party, the set under the brainstem, called striatum, would move intensively when the game was lost.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the nervous system's "self-stimulation" mechanism.
This is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the flight from the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economist members of this group of researchers pursued analyses of financial supervision.
During these meetings, three groups outbid a partner in various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the real value of the product in question, and so they made their bet.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they came out on top of the game, then they would receive an additional 15 dollars, as a reward.
While the third group received this $ 15 before the auction, but the members of the group also lost this money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was on victory in one group, while in the other, on failure.
By proving the neurologists' hypothesis in this way, the members of the team of players "against failure" were willing to bet higher than those made by the control group and the group "for victory".
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any already existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena observed during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories by now leading to a third explanation." - noted Andrew Schotter, professor of the School of Economics of New York University.
Hepatitis: when should we see a doctor?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned as one of the leading causes of death.
There are an estimated one hundred thousand patients with the hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven thousand are undergoing treatment. This is due to the fact that patients often do not know that they are carriers of the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but the pathogens and diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, it is recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B anyway. There is no vaccine for C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating contaminated food, usually accompanied by poor general condition, weakness, stomach upset and nausea.
Then develops on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible jaundice, the stool becomes lighter and the urine takes a darker color. Recovery can take two to three weeks.
Worldwide, every year, one million people die from the most severe form of this disease, such as cancer or cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that, according to estimates, only one in ten patients receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know they have the virus, because the pathogenic gene sneakily destroys liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than average among a population of three groups: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattooed people.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic hepatitis C worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured, if detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing patients from around the world.
Its goal is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Benelux governments nationalise part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states are coming to the aid of the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European banking institution in distress following the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalizing it. The three countries are supporting, to the tune of 11.2 billion euros, this financial and insurance institution also having interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments reached an agreement at the highest level in this case, also appealing to the European Central Bank and the head of competition of the European Commission.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has been deepening for more than a year is for Fortis Bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be made in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy back nearly half (up to 49%) of the bank's capital located in each country.
The bank will undoubtedly sell part of its shareholdings, including, in the first place, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch organization ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis shares began a steep fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too big to be allowed to fail.
On Friday alone, the company's shares fell 12 percent to its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, stocks have fallen by more than two-thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around 14 billion euros, which, according to the company's managers, is not realistic.
The company's management blames uncertainty across the Atlantic, in connection with the adoption of the $700 billion US bailout, for the fall in Fortis shares.
On Monday, papers have already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as the new managing director.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the merits.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank's customer circle and no branch was stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also acquired leasing companies.
Does the one who believes in God feel less pain?
According to the results of recent research, religious belief functions as a kind of analgesic, which has already helped to make the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article according to which researchers from the University of Oxford carried out an interesting experiment by analyzing at what level belief in God can influence human tolerance for pain.
In this bizarre experiment, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Through a technique of palpation of the human brain, it has also been discovered that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiments, in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More precisely, the experiment is conducted as follows: an instrument emitting sparks and scattering electroshocks is attached to the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked participants in the experiment to look closely at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with the Ermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers behind this experiment hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary evokes some kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, focused on its calming effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time received 20 electroshocks in four parts in succession, while looking at either the religious-themed painting or the more general themed one.
Catholics said that at the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt like they were "safe," like someone who is "taken care of" and they "calmed down, and peace invaded them."
At the sight of the painting of religious theme, they reported 12% less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, believes that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in atheists, provided you find the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image to which they react very positively, such as a mother or father," the psychologist said.
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, actually change our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, the only question remains as to what effect would be the effect on the pain regulation of the subjects if believers were shown a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same caliber?
Would seeing a better quality Virgin Mary lead to better results?
You are what you disclose about yourself
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google claims that it can be found deep in people's pockets just like the sky above their heads. He knows where they spent their holidays, which specialists they consult and what their interests are.
But that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the company's influential people.
While skeptics draw a parallel with Orwell's vision of horror, they do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that the founders of Google can respect their initial goal which sounded like this: "Let's collect in one system all the information in the world!".
According to the Google executive interviewed, after ten years of global upheaval, they are still only at the beginning of their goals of being able to process all information.
To the question: what will be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What could I do tomorrow?" or "What job would work best for me?" However, software will only be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first glance, the day it knows enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used during Internet searches, the IP address of the computer initiating the search and the pages subsequently consulted by interested persons are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can see what they searched for, what they clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, a program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will submit products and services to us based on our previous statements and saved preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what my work is? ask users, who are concerned about Google's monopoly of information.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can arouse fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or possibly revolt against power that can provoke a counter-reaction in Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that the search terms are not only recorded, but in justified cases they are transmitted to a third party, and in this kind of legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
Perhaps the most high-profile example in recent times is the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google passed on to the Brazilian government the information it had gathered from the public page called Orkut, allowing identification.
Human rights-conscious netizens breathed a sigh of relief last May, when Google, arm in arm with electronic legal protection agency EFF, proved its right in court against the FBI. According to the ruling, in the future, Google will still not be able to be compelled by any of the constitution's points to disclose information about the FBI's secret request of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won over the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, passed several years earlier. But in the end, he failed to obtain the lists of private users' searches, nor the entire list of websites and keywords from the last two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is castigated by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and private domain suffer when they start using Google services. As a result, they are attacking them in the spirit of revolt against multinational corporations that are proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and its "wildlings" of enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic computer users who appear in many countries see Google as the next generation of big business, the "hip corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, labeled as an invader of the world because of Windows.  even if both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and the package of programs, continuously refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, compared to the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what Web 2.0, the most proclaimed key word in recent years, pulls behind it.
Indeed, Web 2.0 is not about anything other than collaboration, the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind, and that we use the communication channels at our disposal, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link them to other performances, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then, it can link these to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also keep blogs, where their most recent photo galleries automatically appear that they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can read many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands from the morning photos, taken by the circle of mutual friends, with whom her unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the company that fired one of its employees, just for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about top management,  We can be sure of one thing: the term privacy is totally to be reconsidered nowadays.
The one who lives an online life, is made up of what he shows of himself, and this is how we can define the principle behind the behavior of today's young people.
Whoever wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to circumvent Google's monopoly, can do so (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but, at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not the least. Google online services, from word processing to image processing, reading information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not attached to huge server farms and which do not assemble our best profile, having existed until now.
Public opinion is waiting, without really hiding it, for the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). The AdWords/AdSense advertising domains threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while the services introduced at an increasingly rapid pace cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but for many other creators of computer programs.
However, critical observers find, alongside all this, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the top management of the company refused, in its entirety, the protests of the employees, after it doubled the price of the company kindergarten and after the company deemed the daily multiple catering too expensive,  taken at any time. All this seems ridiculous compared to the fact that already in 2006, Google acquiesced to the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that hurt good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company's internal rules, new services are not announced only when they can be used. What is certain is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that Google's book and magazine scanning and archiving project is taking on such dimensions that the company will soon find itself facing the Supreme Court of the United States, others tremble in front of its Health system, because in it, we can build a complete medical profit from our results of previous analyzes,  our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can give good raw material for the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel by the famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian semitones, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a frightening way just through Google's data.
Two minors helped remove traces of Ózd's double killing
"The police summoned two minors for questioning in the case of the double homicide in Ózd. According to well-founded suspicions, they helped to remove the traces of the crime." - said the spokesman of the police station department of Borsod.
The young people have admitted the charges against them. For now, they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraphic Agency) are young girls, defend themselves free.
Complicity in murder can result in detention for up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double homicide of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was remanded in custody on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicide, committed with premeditation and self-interest.
During the investigation, it emerged that the 23-year-old owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and it is for this reason that he lured his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in Ózd where he killed him, as well as the man's 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from MTI, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he would commit his crimes hidden at the scene of the crime is proof of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
Warsaw Stock Exchange makes proposal for purchase of Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the package of shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal, which the Poles made despite the fact that, previously, the Czechs had excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wants to divest itself of more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech business daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest bid so far for the takeover of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic Nasdaq Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have made an offer so far.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the least good new owner, and did not rule out the fact that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated at between 5 and 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 per cent of shareholdings, followed by 14.7 per cent of Ceská Sporitelna Bank and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their Tuesday comments on the international financial crisis, which are getting worse by the day, the leading newspapers of the European press are already talking about a "second 11 September".
"The global financial catastrophe, we owe it to the American president" - accuses the Rome daily, La Repubblica. "The president has not even been able to unite with his own party behind a hastily improvised bill to help a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as billionaire Warren Buffett mentioned, it is more appropriate to speak of a second September 11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
In El Mundo's view, it was the failings of the political leadership there that brought the global economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system is growing every day, and thereafter, the whole world will pay a high price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, but according to the congressional vote, a real danger looms, that Washington will not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in a vacuum, just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored - stresses the Tages-Anzeiger in Geneva.
Some states can still hold out a lifeline to their staggering financial institutions, and with their taxpayers' money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, we need the states of the European Union to disregard their national egoism, and to centralize control above the divided financial markets.
On Monday alone, the weakened financial institutions received more than EUR 100 billion - recalled the Viennese daily, Der Standard, adding that fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hands in their pockets, very deep, in a similar way to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, is sweeping across the old continent.
The "rescuers" should not immediately brandish a hundred billion euros, but it would be wise if they noted in which case it would be rational to touch taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
The intelligent automobile mimics the flight of the bumblebee
What method would be better for developing technologies that can avoid an obstacle, if not the imitation of an obstacle detector already existing in nature?
Like for example, that of bees.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC, taking place in Japan, buzzing bees gave Nissan engineers the starting strategic idea, to inspire them on how to design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired self-robotic control system of the BR23C type, which it equipped with the qualities of bees, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee forms its own oval-shaped space, which in reality looks a lot like our secure protective shell - explained Kazuhhiro Doi, director of the brand's research and development and technological public relations department, at the exhibition.
The faceted eye of the bee plays a key role, since it is able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To mimic the functions of the faceted eye, engineers approached the idea of the laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, evaluates distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which transforms it into an evasive maneuver right away.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it at an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Unlike any system that exists today, this evasive maneuver is entirely instinctive.
"If this were not the case, the mini robot car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for the moment collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process should reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process should take place in the blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees have to avoid other bees, in our case, we could only use rotary movement, acceleration and slowing down as maneuvers available to the mini auto robot.
The BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and have a greater energy concentration, making their life longer than in the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is paramount, not the processing of the data, let alone the ability to store.
This mechanism should only process and react to a few incoming signals per second.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers. This way, it only uses a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
You don't need memory with a capacity of gigabytes, or even megabytes.
This is the first step towards designing technology for instant avoidance. According to Nissan estimates, this system will make its way into mass-produced cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles in his path.
We even gave the expensive baby a name
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan, aimed at buying up bad loans from banks, and to be used in installments, is ready.
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters reports that in new debates extending until after midnight on Saturday, local East Coast time, congressional leaders have agreed on the controversies that have existed for days and days, around the rescue plan totaling $ 700 billion.
"We have taken a serious step forward" - said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the US House of Representatives, according to which it remains only to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and be effective, but more needs to be implemented. According to Pelosi, this is not about rescuing Wall Street, but about turning the wheels of the economy the other way.
The written version of the plan was made public before Asian markets opened Sunday night at 8 p.m. Washington local time (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., according to Central European local time), but did not cause a dramatic rise in the stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill called the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Then his fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress achieved last night, and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, White House spokesman.
Moreover, the program diverges from the Bush administration's initial proposal that the $700 billion should be spent at one time on the purchase of securities relating to bad credits.
From now on, a maximum of half of the sum of 700 billion can be spent. The first $250 billion will be delivered immediately after Congress passes the law, likely on Monday. This first sum will be used by the Secretary of the Treasury to buy bad loans from the banks, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the discretion of the President.
The program will be overseen by an independent body, in which the chairman of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The spending of the second half of the $700 billion depends on a new congressional decree.
Under the Act, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: it will be able to purchase bad debts, mortgages and bad mortgages, and other types of "toxic" debts at the same time.
The appropriate people in the department have stated that buybacks can take place through an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to take part in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools that cause the concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damage.
Paulson said the law provides the tools to spend $700 billion on the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it's the vast buyback of bad loans, their insurance, or avoiding the risk of the system leading to the collapse of one major financial institution.
"We will take the necessary steps, to be ready for the application of the law, as soon as it is signed" - he added.
On the other hand, bank executives who are in bad shape and waiting for state aid can expect that their severance packages, simply called golden parachute across the Atlantic, will be capped by the government.
Wage caps are mentioned only in specific cases. In addition, the limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat offers its assistance to the company.
The capping principle means that if the Treasury buys back at an auction, they will levy a surplus tax on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Directly after the bad debt buys out, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to executives is not exaggerated.
For the image to be complete, it must still be added that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The cap only concerns new contracts, in order to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal caps will be in place on the salaries of chief executives - commented the chairman of the committee in charge of financial benefits of the House of Representatives, the Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State acquires a right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan. In this way, the risk of taxpayers decreases, since they can even be a winner in the deal as soon as the economy and with it the rescued banks fall back on their feet.
The bill mentions that within five years, the President must submit a proposal to Congress that will rule on how losses will be returned to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That's not why American citizens mandated us, this doesn't protect taxpayer dollars – said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
Her fellow Ohio Democrat, Mary Kaptur, thinks it's the same people who are pressing for action, as those responsible for the Wall Street collapse.
Industrial prices continued to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial selling prices increased by 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 per cent compared to August 2007 - reports the Central Statistical Office of Hungary.
Industrial export selling prices increased by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008, while compared to a year earlier, they decreased by 3.9 per cent.
As a result of fluctuations in domestic and export prices, industrial producer prices rose 0.7 per cent over the previous month, and 3.2 per cent over the previous year.
Domestic industrial selling prices rose only to a lesser extent: by 0.1 per cent, compared with the previous month.
Domestic selling prices in the processing industry sectors rose only marginally by 0.1% compared to July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was observed in the leather goods and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 per cent), led by the manufacture of bags and belts with a monthly increase of 4.6 per cent, followed by footwear production with a 2.5 per cent monthly increase.
Higher prices for plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a considerable monthly increase in prices in the chemical products and materials manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
This resulted in deflation in petroleum processing (1.4%), electrical machinery and appliance manufacturing (0.9%), and minimal increase in wood processing (0.1%).
Prices for paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
Other sectors of the processing industry recorded an increase of between 0.2% and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which account for a significant share of domestic industrial exploitation, prices rose by 0.3% in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in gas prices introduced by the authorities since 1 July.
In a twelve-month comparison, taking into account domestic sales in the processing sectors, prices in the oil processing sector rose the most significantly (32.4 per cent).
In the metallurgical products manufacturing sector, prices increased by 13.2%, while in the important area of food, beverage and tobacco production, prices increased by 11%.
Price decreases occurred in the textile and textile products production (2.5 per cent) and the manufacture of machinery and electrical appliances (0.3 per cent).
In the other sectors of the processing industry, price increases ranged from 0.6% to 9.1%.
In the processing industry as a whole, prices increased by 10.2 per cent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors were 18.7% higher than in the previous year.
Among the internal trade groups and by sector allocation, in August, the sectors that initiated investment profit showed the most significant monthly price increase (0.7 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, while those in the energy and materials for further processing sectors were unchanged from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase was observed in the energy and materials for further processing sectors (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, inflation was measured at 6.8 per cent, while for profit-making sectors, a decrease of 1.4 per cent.
Export selling prices in the industrial sector, in HUF, rose 1.1 percent in August from the previous month, while they fell 3.9 percent year-on-year.
In one month, our national means of payment weakened by 1.7 percent against the euro, and by 7.1 percent against the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it strengthened by 7.5 per cent against the euro and 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes there is a good chance that around January 12, the US-Hungary visa waiver agreement will come into force. This is what the Minister of Foreign Affairs said in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "now, everything depends only on when the electronic entry and control systems across the Atlantic are put into operation".
All the time, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will present the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will meet with the foreign policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support bank bailout
On Sunday, both Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major US parties, assured of their support for the government's $700 billion bailout. However, there are politicians who are demanding the resignation of the US Treasury Secretary.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, congressional representatives and the administration finally announced at dawn on Sunday that they had reached tentative agreements on the bank bailout.
This financing plan, aimed at thawing the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as more fit than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with economic issues coming to the fore, Obama has once again managed to get a bit of a lead. McCain's lead, achieved with the nomination of Sarah Palin as his running mate just after the Republican convention, has melted.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass legislation on the $700 billion bailout.
He pointed out that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages that he too supports.
"Now is the time to act, with responsibility (...) A danger threatens your work, your economies, entire industrial sectors and the stability of the entire economy," he told a crowd of 35,000.
He did not fail to describe McCain's economic ideas as outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: "We'll all have a hard time swallowing it ... But doing nothing is not a possible way."
The Republican senator said that the proposal mentions the creation of a Treasury review board and caps on severance pay for senior executives, and that he personally is very committed to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury secretary.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that there are serious hopes the House will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
The press review of the German linguistic territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware – this is how Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country, evokes.
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of reds and blacks.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the causes of the CSU's dramatic defeat in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now it is these same modern citizens who are turning their backs on them.
This change of epoch is at the same time the problem of the whole of Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not entirely a surprise, but on Sunday came to an end a process that was likely just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party came to an end.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU fell with 47.7 percent for the first time since the fifties, with a score below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, at the time of the much-mentioned Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization "devouring his parents", implemented in the region consistently by the CSU.
Sociologists have been announcing this for 40 years, but they were very wrong about the rhythm. However, secularization, the results of education and the establishment of North and East Germans in the rapidly developing region of Bavaria could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks, it is precisely the groups of traditional citizens who have rather distanced themselves from the CSU, such as the self-employed, craftsmen, baccalaureate holders and higher education graduates.
In these groups, support for the CSU has fallen below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In his article entitled "Who? With whom? Party chairmen stand in the reserve in the face of coalition issues", the conservative Austrian daily looks at the situation of the confused domestic politics that took hold after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian socialists of the SPÖ want to talk to the conservatives of the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids the SPÖ to interfere in its internal affairs.
The populist BZÖ party is open to negotiations. The Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
The elections have taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; During the debates held on public television, party leaders barely hinted at their cards.
Werner Faymann, the SPÖ chairman, confirmed that he wanted to talk to the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible - this is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, remains open on Faymann's part.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer approach was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the reds' proposals.
As he has already said, a collaboration will surely be fruitless if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
In his party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is momentarily a completely open question. These points absolutely must be debated within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, the president of the BZÖ, is again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of reds and blacks, we are ready to assume governmental responsibilities" - said Haider.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by the France, began in Paris as representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In her message to the plenary, as one of the main spokespersons of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz MEP for the European People's Party, drew attention to segregation in education, as it is a violation of the law that most affects Roma children and therefore one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of Fidesz Popular Party MP's group, Járóka warned that alongside the distinctions made during recruitment, Roma disappear from the labour market, in the first place, as a result of their low qualifications.
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have secondary school diplomas, and as a result of poor quality elementary education, only a tiny fraction have the opportunity to obtain a higher education diploma."
In addition, Járóka stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role in asserting other fundamental rights.
Investment in the early education of Roma children means strengthening the economies of the member countries of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relationships in the widest possible circle, also between Roma and non-Roma.
Indeed, the earlier a Roma child starts school, the more likely he or she is to become a productive member of the labour market; through taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the State budget.
"Because of their nationality of the European Union, Roma must be guaranteed their right to quality education, and be protected from low-quality and sectarian education." - stressed Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, goal-oriented collaboration and action by the European Union is needed for an immediate acceleration of the process of desegregation of schools. For this, compliance with existing and pending anti-discrimination directives is of paramount importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken. Roma children must be given the opportunities guaranteed by democracy, so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe" - demanded Járóka.
In the name of the "European Year for Equal Opportunities" for all, the aim of the Summit for Equal Opportunities in Europe, held every year since the Summit in Berlin last year, is to provide a single platform to support measures taken in favour of equal opportunities and the fight against discrimination, aimed at European level and at Member State level.
A fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market is spiralling out of control.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of information regarding the prescription of medicines, in all cases, to the consent of the data subject.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like entrusting your chicken coop to a fox" - recalled Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage drug prescriptions, to the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the insured capital in case of damage depend on the state of health of the customer who presents himself, and if they consider that the risk is too great, they do not even insure him.
In the past, they sent candidates for a medical examination, and they only signed insurance contracts with them after they had seen the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, he easily obtains from pharmacies, the data concerning the person's purchases of medicines in the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines itself, what disease the person suffers from and what is his state of health.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts them in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some determine at the same time a risk coefficient, so there is not much left for the insurer to do except paperwork. However, tiny problems may still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or hot flashes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others, not.
Companies have developed in research and data analysis. They must ask the patient for permission before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
They are now forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their shortcomings in the past.
Recently, some companies have also been processing laboratory test results and linking them with drug consumption data. In this way, they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and controlling usage is becoming increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill to expand the circle of control of authorities over companies specializing in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has further developed his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive consent of the data subject.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his consent or not, since if he refuses, the insurance companies do not sign an insurance contract with him.
Thus, and ultimately, chickens depend on the benevolence of the fox.
UHC: grace for a transition period
The decision on the fate of the fallen Huber-Beckstein duo will be made in October.
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been postponed.
The party's chairman, Erwin Hube, and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still keep their places. The question is, how long will grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic 17 percent loss of votes, will be on the agenda of the exceptional party congress, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this much-criticized pair have, in any case, made it felt that they did not particularly care about their seats.
Thanks to this, they worked to appease the furious members of the faction and the base, who a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the height of his career - the Christian Social Union won 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the putsch against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "sole sovereign" of Bavaria giving 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
But conservatives still count heavily in this southern region, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced into coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the vice-president and the federal minister of agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as Huber's possible successor, was also given a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates groping discussions with the liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Free Voters, trained along right-wing values.  about a possible coalition of the Munich government.
A strange thumbing of the nose of fate was that with the help of the list of Free Voters, enters the legislation the Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stroiber served as a possibility of putsch perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, and then treats bluntly the very ambitious municipal politician.
Now the CSU leaders are putting all their energy into stabilizing Beckstein in one way or another.
In this transition, Stoiber, who until now was pulling the strings behind the scenes, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, has designated September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some sharp remarks at the CDU. According to him, they deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel can only be chancellor again if they somehow re-establish themselves, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hardly hiding her disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of ground of the CSU will not negatively influence the grand coalition in Berlin.
This is however relative because it will not be easier to manage the wounded CSU, and the crisis of the Social Democrats still lasts.
Since 1946, the SPD achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - rivals: 110 - 0
No opposition MPs entered the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this is due to a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it is explained by illegalities committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the 110-person legislature in this country of 10 million people has been very much without opposition for many decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition joining forces under the name United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his mandate as president for the fourth time in dubious elections,  In the footsteps of the amendment of the Constitution in 2006, this time "would allow" the presence of some opposition MPs in Parliament.
In this way, the ODSZ renounced its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, economically increasingly dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order described as undemocratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive entry visas, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus had to take a credit because of the decrease in imports of Russian natural gas, always more expensive, and thus contributed to the transition of the company Beltransgaz, owner of the gas pipes crossing the country, into Russian hands.
The fact that the OSCE, in evaluating the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than shortcomings, such as the ban on standing for one third of opposition candidates, referred to a prior appeasement.
However, Monday's OSCE communiqué already challenged the campaign, during which most opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present during the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: political detainees have been released, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, always refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia. However, Russia, with which Belarus forms a confederation on paper, has been considering the two independent territories for a month now.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important thing is that dialogue has been initiated between Belarus and the EU" - said Alexander Milinkevich to our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that it remains so, despite the fact that "the government was afraid in this parliament which has no weight, to bring in even a single opponent".
The opposition does not plan protest actions in view of the results. Instead, she is trying to get her message about the need for economic reform to voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of worries on this side: we have to print our opposition newspapers in Russia, the local authorities are putting obstacles in our way in terms of distribution, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly" - said Milinkevich,  referring to the fact that in the current Lukashenko regime, which considers social security as its main result, the most officially supported layer of pensioners no longer really considers it appropriate.
"Because of the country's indebtedness and the rising trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery', is only a matter of time," Milinkevich believes.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the Commonwealth of Independent States mission, told Russia's Ria Novosti news agency: "People don't believe in words, but in deeds." In this way, the absence of the opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside the other, largely global, issues.
Today there will also be an France-India summit, focusing on cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognises that India is a major emerging democratic power that should be given a wider say in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to agree on their support for New Delhi's candidacy for permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
They did not dwell too much on this issue yesterday at this 9th summit organized in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the head of diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years, they would double trade, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be too ambitious a target.
In this sense, they have harmonized from a legal point of view the 26 bilateral conventions with India concerning civil flights. In this way, air trade will also be able to take off in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009 at the latest.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, which is the EU's largest trading partner, on the one hand, and New Delhi, which is only in ninth place among the EU's partners, on the other.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan was strongly condemned, as were all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a United Nations conference on the subject was mentioned.
The completion of the Doha Trade Round has also been called for, although both are a major part of the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains committed to the energy and climate agenda, including that it would like to reduce its emissions of toxic materials by at least twenty percent until 2020.
India also agreed on this, as well as that a global deal should be made at next year's climate conference, and greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by fifty percent until 2050.
They would also like to prevent the rise in food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian head of state is visiting the French capital today, where in a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth twenty billion euros for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to information from the news agency, the agreement would cover 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair expects for this edition, more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403,000 titles on display, and Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Butterfly: indeed, Italy will be present institutionally, with a Point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by the appointment with the press in the Room Struktur, at the butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present figures, trends and prospects on the position of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors is gradually decreasing in relation to total Italian production, and in particular, in relation to that for adults and children.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never in the history of the Chigi Palace have we had revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from today, this new measure is in force against the smart guys, against who points and then goes to drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-lazy novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Revolving doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services," says the minister.
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
"It's reformism," Brunetta stressed.
The installation in all the establishments of the Presidency of the Council is completed with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance from employees has been recorded, assures the secretary general: "it is a process shared by employees, and we have had the collaboration of all".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; No more coffee or croissant.
Promise of Brunetta, who suggests with a smile, "a good cappuccino at 7am is an excellent and healthy resolution".
During a conference at the Ecole Supérieure de l'Administration publique
From Rome, the minister communicates that "in three months, the sick leave of public employees has been reduced by 50%, or 60 thousand more workers in one year".
And he adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more efficient.
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and well in addition to inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees united to challenge the norms of the Brunetta decree using Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Civil Service today spreads the data concerning the decline in absenteeism in the workplace due to illness - writes the consumer association - the people of "active slackers" continues to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive employees of the Public Administration have come together to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of supplementary allowances in the event of disability by reason of service is contested; the extension of the hours of the sick worker's home duty hours, during which monitoring visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions requested by the Minister.
Accidents in the workplace, Napolitano: "Crucial prevention"
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail data confirm that the white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To have the attention of institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic aspect, Anmil celebrates today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the subject of prevention in the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the president of Anmil, the National Association of the Mutilated and Invalids of Labour, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "sincere appreciation for the continuous associative effort in favor of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of victims and public awareness"
"Naturally indignant, everyone has banged their fists to put an end to such tragedies which, by their size, arouse the clamour of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if the daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector assume particular importance for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not to underestimate the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed how "this phenomenon of the white dead constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and requires all the institutions, to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly".
The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from still being impressive," stressed Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli later.
"We do not want this 'tendency to be cheap' to translate into minor attention, because it is precisely when attention relaxes that tragedy happens.
"We believe that, in general, not enough is done to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be achieved through multiple actions."
"In our opinion," Mercandelli stressed, "more controls and inspections are needed, as is greater intervention in the training of workers, starting at school."
- He added- "that more needs to be done in terms of communication and public awareness.
"But above all, we need a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for victims of work" and the "drift of assistance towards which the system has been moving in recent years".
"The objective, therefore, is to give back to the worker the guarantee of insurance - he added - so that the fate of the one who has an accident, must not depend on the spontaneism or the broadening of the legislator"
Mp3 player pointed out, they put hearing at risk.
Listening to music at full volume for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players, can cause permanent damage to hearing.
This is announced by the European Commission, which, in a press release issued in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the unforeseen and recently identified health risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific report - we read in the note - it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music at full volume using portable music devices, for more than one hour a day and a week, are at risk of permanent hearing loss."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people, who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at full volume, may unconsciously damage their hearing beyond repair," says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to the scientific data," continues the EU official, "this is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What matters most is to educate consumers and make this information public domain.
We also need to review existing control systems based on scientific opinion so that they are fully effective and can keep up with new technologies."
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
"The scientists confirm that there are good reasons for concern, and that the European Commission will now examine with member states and other interested parties, what measures, if any, could be adopted to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise from portable and similar music devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but there is growing concern about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
This data can be well limited using solutions such as reducing noise levels and duration.
The EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the current limits on the maximum noise level allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods, risk permanent hearing loss after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified at around 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to leave the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we finish, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning, in the new headquarters, behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months' time, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will finalise the guidelines for Rome.
In March, when they have finished, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, in order to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
" "The commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented, Alemanno stresses, it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome that can be used by the political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Municipal Council.
No superimposition of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to develop a great project for Rome.
By March, she will have finished her tasks and will then disappear, because this experiment must have a precise time duration.
In June-announces the mayor- we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital. "
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as France thanks to the Attali Commission, as indeed in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is burdened by the day-to-day management and emergencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to see forward, and further, towards a deeper foresight, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wishes to emphasize that "this Commission is not a useless body or a bureaucratic whole: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to Roman city dwellers, and will serve to study and involve the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "we need a draft strategic reference, neither firm nor immobile, in order to allow our city to improve, which it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unitary spirit, ".
A future that, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual municipal borders, but that will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as capital, but "also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. Here's why.
A famous American politician who is keen to pass for independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, destroyed the American economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition."
Obama is really cheeky: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that has two governors and five black senators in all!"
In reality, these are attacks that say little; These are obviously racial attacks, and do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, all of which state that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks from the heart and not from the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know well to whom the American patriot will give his vote.
Here emerges an aspect of the American mentality kept secret until the end.
"Say what you want, we will see ourselves to put the cross, on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed until now, so much so that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all this reasoning, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what mistakes did Bush make during his term in office? 89 per cent responded: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was kicked home in the butt.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack their bags.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush's weak spot.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge task to accomplish.
In the USA, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for deletions. And many blame the Internet, this "murder" of newsprint.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mind control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly tell the information officers that they felt less worried about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, deletions in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to assemble the newspapers, are a big problem.
This is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as the general public understands it is to be reduced significantly.
An obvious but complex pessimism pervades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and journalists in printing newspapers are convinced that journalism at the national level is going down the wrong path.
Locally, the executive group is at 65%.
Print versus broadcast publication.
Journalists have no trouble seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses are making their way to the Internet, perceived by many as the "murderer" of newsprint.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel is increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to taking up technology hoping it would "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest snag in American journalism lies between who runs the newsrooms—that is, the directors—and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is linked to "occupational safety".
Managers who expect to lose their job within 3 years are 47% nationally.
As far as journalists are concerned, we go to 30%.
That of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, editor's note) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the USA, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of take it or leave it.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn $10,000 a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, passed a certain number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often "sick" during the year.
It's the climate's fault.
UNIPOL:COURT ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS IN GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to dismiss the case of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a dwelling in Rome.
. Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the Unipol-Bnl escalation investigation.
During his trial last week, he was granted house release as a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate agent be allowed to travel from the provincial city to a dwelling in the capital.
According to the court, such trips (which the pm did not grant) would allow him to influence his company and have access to the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the rescue plan of $ 700 billion approved by the White House: a good significant number of Americans were, and still are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is yesterday's New York Times that confirms it to us communicating that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions as well as the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance,  powerful especially in the central and southern states.
The soul, precisely, that was felt in a despotic way with the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is only an example of the changes, the great changes that the current economic earthquake pre-announces or already allows: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not only here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena that have been brewing for some time, to such an extent that, in the new climate, they are solidifying and revealing themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the updating, the extraordinary revival, of the dual state-sovereign category, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions that obviously have close foreign relations, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of people and families who live in a single country, in a single state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, as responding to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global, but politically, it is almost only national here.
Political internationalisation really seems out of the game or has little to say: the clear proof is provided to us by the European Union which, divided as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, is unable to decide on any common political line.
And so, it is from the government of each State that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all an allocation of credits: when we go through a difficult period, only the States possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two invaluable resources, elements that no market or international organization will ever have at their disposal in a similar way.
This new emphasis on the nation-state crisis is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the still major importance that more recent economic developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor quite related to this element: territoriality.
. Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized all at once, that our future will have to settle accounts more and more with things that are not very material such as water,  crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth, but which are absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than one who is not, that is, he who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty which, however, provides for a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leaderships, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of gray areas.
And moreover, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even disturbing: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of estrangement that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
Thus increases even more the conviction of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be ever more alien to the opinions of the majorities.
In short, the demand for leadership feeds underground, a powerful and ramified movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifests itself in the improvised electoral "revolts" or, in the collective changes of moods of recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of Labour in Great Britain,  to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right in Italy did not happen by chance).
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, someone would say, have more and more difficulty, which is not new, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis reinforces, increases and potentially agitates disproportionately.
In view of all this, to speak of a current "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda, seems frankly exaggerated.
But we say, keep your eyes wide open, this is not without reason.
The super glue to walk on walls.
Defeat the laws of gravity with a super glue and, in the future, walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centers, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring just 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to keep a 100-kilogram body glued to a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know that use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti." Explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that ensure the animal a perfect adherent.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it "detaches easily from the wall," says Liming Dai, a researcher in the University of Dayton's School of Engineering.
WALKING ON WALLS? "This material could be used as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers are thinking of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since carbon nanotubes are conductive of heat and electric current.
Other applications could be in aerospace engineering.
For now, no superheroes.
THE OTHER IS ALSO LOOKING FOR A NEW ADHESIVE.
In an article in the American journal American Chemical Society, the Californian researchers presented an adhesive formed of microfibers like hair, which self-cleans dust during movement on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adhesion.
Medicines: never with fruit juices.
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because thirst-quenching and rich in vitamins, if associated with certain vital drugs, alter their absorption amplifying or decreasing depending on the case, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether canned or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; During the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway in Philadelphia, he sounded a new alarm: all it took is a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs, cancelling out their beneficial effects and putting patients' health at risk.
Grapefruit juice has already been heavily criticized for being held responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antistaminal and neurological drugs, to toxic levels.
RISKY DRUGS - It was the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which had given the news in a newsletter dated two years ago, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger deriving from this mix and to be careful what one drinks, if one takes drugs such as, for example,  Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT JUST GRAPEFRUIT- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the Public University of Milan: "These discoveries are in general, immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will have to change the informative notes of the drugs if necessary.
It is always advisable to read the illustrative papers of the drugs you are taking, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to speak clearly to the doctor or pharmacist," the expert told Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a well-known New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the greatest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman wrote, in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that unleashed many controversies, and which was reproached to the economist for years, but which has now proved accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from public attention," Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the European Central Bank's executive committee, Krugman is a "valuable economist," but also a "very aggressive" whistleblower, particularly critical of the Bush administration's liberalism excesses.
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It's the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following almost a year's work, carried out by volunteer developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various new features: from the welcome screen, and the interface revised and become less austere, to others more important, such as the compatibility born for the operating system Apple Mac OS X,  and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the 2007 Office suite, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting are some functions specific to certain modules, such as the one that reduces the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by e-mail, or to import PDF files into the graphic development module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that unite the typical graphic of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or text developer.
The collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the elaboration of texts, since each collaborator is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the web, and in the coming weeks they should issue the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at the http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet address and is in addition to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday.
Besides Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual available additionally, for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be shipped to your home or workplace.
And if the theme of free access can be a way to spread it in homes, it is precisely in business, that Open Office the suite tries the great challenge, already being able to count on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, which could also open up to business prospectives.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing equivalent to Word; Calc, is the worksheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint rival presentations ;D base, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphics module.
Goal for 2008, to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the planned figure
Kohl too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
It is the website of the daily L'Equipe that reports the news.
At 26, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist at Cera, the third-generation Epo, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl's test tubes are part of those carried out in recent weeks by the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-analyses confirm the positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will necessarily have to expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's third-generation Epo positivity was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told The Associated Press that he had notified Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind Spain's Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, taking the polka dot jersey for the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES WONDERS IF ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has recently turned into a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
Would this turn the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times is interested in, which has dedicated a long article debating the theme of racism in Italy, starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "paradox of the north": the Nordic regions are both those with "more integration and more work", but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most important support for the Lega Nord".
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislature wanted by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the deportation of illegal immigrants is cited as evidence of the changing climate in Italy.
A trend underlined by the Pope as well as by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, during his meeting with Benedict XVI in the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism."
Found the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of the plane of Steve Fosset, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris was found on a plateau at 3,000 meters above sea level, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson dismissed any remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is the one Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found on the plane or in the vicinity.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said that a few hours after the location of the wreckage, a team of investigators sent to the scene, identified the aircraft: it is indeed the Bellanca 8kcab, disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset's personal belongings were found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing Fosset's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweater.
The search for Fossett was halted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had earned himself a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
On the sixth attempt, he became in 2002, the first man to complete the circumnavigation of the world on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had flown around the world non-stop.
Among all these records, also that of having flown at 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertisement you don't expect.
An extraordinary 4x4 of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, wide surfaces and sharp angles.
Here, in summary, is Glk, the latest "compact" off-road from the Maison de l'Etoile, with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a wind of novelty in this sector.
Precisely because of its non-standard content, unexpected and unconventional will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms, from October 17.
Thus, the hype that will accompany the debut of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A maxi display project, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, we will have the impression that by looking at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elimina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertisement, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of motorist communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future buyers? We'll see.
These are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the "Ultras Italy" group that has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, had never created big problems.
Nor had ever clashed with the opposing tifosi.
The extraction of the group is right-wing.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups were added (few in reality) from Campania and Puglia.
They had tricolor flags on which appeared their city of origin: Saturday night, they were all removed so as not to be identified.
They are inspired by the English tifoserie.
In Bulgaria, they found a tifoserie of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The FIGC had made available to the Italian tifosi, 144 tickets for the game: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had indeed controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been banned from attending a stadium.
Four Italian tifosi, who had a history of stadium crime, were not allowed the ticket, and could not make the trip.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will arrive from the Bulgarian police, and will then take action: in this case, it could be that the tifosi arrested or identified in the disorders are serving a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that prohibits attending Italian stadiums, but also European.
In short, our hooligans will no longer set foot in the stadium.
Fortunately.
But now is the time for fear-emulation: that is, others may be added to the first hundred and fifty.
"We must extinguish this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves like this," says the Viminal.
So, "keep your eyes peeled especially in view of Wednesday's national team match in Lecce"
In Puglia there is indeed a small core of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms which can even count on a section of the Aise, that is to say the secret services, which deal precisely with stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the outstretched arm during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria, it is not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the post of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect in Trieste where a core group of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002, resides.
It is true, as Mazzili says, that in Bulgaria, praising Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 tifosis was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the No. 1 of the Observatory - crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group has remained within the rules, now we will see what happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles against Mameli's anthem: these too are not crimes, but if you will allow me, they are not polite..."
Students victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student rental market is not experiencing a crisis
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants' union, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire categories of young people from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families of origin have to bear - explains the head of Sunia's design office, Laura Mariani, - in these cities, the high demand from students has so distorted the market that a process of generalized increase has begun even for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also contain a series of violations: free-to-end, unregistered, no-rent contracts, sublettings.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of the tax are necessary to calm prices.
Reading in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, we go from 650 euros minimum (Bande Nere area), to an average value of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria zone)
In Florence, a bed costs on average, 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), we ask about 600 euros for a single, 450 for a bed in a double.
Slightly lower values (550 euro for a single) for areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can only save if you move away in peripheral areas: 300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a single in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a single, you spend 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for bed, it takes 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the urban economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rentals are often taken by non-EU students, there is a further anomaly: the rent charged to foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old Paradiso cinema, cities eliminate historic cinemas.
Historic movie theaters are closing in favor of Multiplexes.
"A city without movie theaters is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what happens in the large Italian urban centers, but also in the provincial cities,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of large multiscreens, and the death of consumption of single-screens in the central areas of cities, is one of the major events that seems inevitable and indisputable to us; It also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical places and full of memory, "it's as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a piece of the road and so many emotions" observes the director of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso, a film that offers Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix de la jurée de Cannes,  and which told the poetry of a provincial theater, and the nostalgia of a way of living the cinema, lost perhaps forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of traders, say it all: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and it is the cinemas of the main cities that have mainly paid the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 fewer in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Roman Emilia is in the lead with 82 single-screen cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The proof that confirms that the main cause of their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-screen cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but we should still guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a theater closes in a city, these frequents are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the failed deliberation of credit in favor of traders: the antecedent debt of the State is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, between €16 million and €18 million per year would be needed.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about these closures, decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a protocol between City Council and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote single-screen cinemas in historic centers and on the outskirts.
Among the planned regulations, there are tax relief measures for managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic zone, and will have special rates for parking and in certain car parks.
"This is an initiative that I like," observes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by implementing other measures.
However, it is clear that, in order to contrast the superpower of multiplexes, traditional cinemas must also improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that for me has always been important: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso" that I had already been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have experienced so many shared emotions, I turn to the other side so as not to see the panels blackened by dust.
Links between politics and 'ndrangheta, mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choices of the City Hall to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
heavy accusations are launched by the magistrates of the Antimafia Directorate of Calabria, against the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The controls also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his grandson lawyer, namesake of the boss, already sentenced for criminal association of mafia type, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"An affront to legal and moral standards, and above all common sense," write the prosecutors, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay for consultations to Mr. Piromalli.
"Thus the clan would have been granted - write the judges - to officially enter the town halls facilitating the possibilities, already considerable, of control and orientation of the public administration"
The president of the Calabrian regional committee, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "collusion between local committees and organized crime, there is more than one" in his region: "there are places where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest."
This morning's arrests follow those of last July, following which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
At the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved; Already in 1991, and again because of alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of their function of administering the city.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the SVP at the time of the dissolution, was appointed leader of a centre-right coalition after the May 2006 run-off.
He cried foul when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the communal council.
He accused the Deputy Minister of the Interior at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing him of having plotted everything for a political issue, but given the request for imprisonment signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even managed to request the variation of the A3 project.
Starting from the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the pm write, emerged "the readiness to marry the demands of a businessman, representative of a better known group, close to the Piromalli, standardizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy is born from the waves, now the big ones are launched.
This is an inordinate deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and now the world's major energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which giants like Chevron have laid their eyes, and now are trying to get their hands on them.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years now, and in the 70s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was shelved, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil give a great boost to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world's electricity needs could be met by sea swell systems.
This amount would be double that produced by nuclear power plants.
And in addition, there would be currents and tides.
Colossi on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it looked like a real revolutionary step.
Two years away, more and more candidates among these companies that have always been dedicated to traditional energy are betting on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies," a spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal business daily, "and is evaluating opportunities to cooperate with us."
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a deliberate permit by the United States Energy Commission, necessary to give rise to a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially considering that precisely in Alaska, the US continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. New York and New Jersey's Ocean Power, which travel the way of energy from the sea, and the sums invested so far, although their details are not known, indicate according to observers, a growing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts speak of a technology still in its infancy, due to the fact that marine energy does not dispel fears about the environmental impact.
At present, systems like those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create a big problem for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a higher ecological impact.
"And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the sludge up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure turns a turbine which in turn powers a generator.
Energy is sent to shore through submarine cables.
At the moment, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending single federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and parking lot using six subsea turbines from New York's East River.
The movement of water during tides, rotates the blades of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that powers a generator.
Verdant has announced that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
One particular interest, they tell the Institute for the Research of Electric Power, deserves at this moment, the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on tidal energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, are looking to the coast, invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and plan investments up to 35 million in 2009.
