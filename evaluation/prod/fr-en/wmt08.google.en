Inflation in Europe has skidded on food
The accelerated inflation, measured in the euro zone, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, the price increase in the 13 countries of the euro area was greater than expected, after an inflation rate of 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 percent cent was recorded, said the statistics office of the European Community located in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts pointed to just 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the American, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the key interest rate, saying that the decrease in interest, with the growth in commodity prices and the fall in the rate of unemployment, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, this is Catch 22 for the ECB: &quot;we must dissuade&quot; inflation so that we no longer have to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 percent is a record for the past twelve years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the Eurozone took off due to rapidly rising food and energy prices.
Grain futures quotes rose 88 percent and soybean prices also hit their highest since 1973.
The price of edible oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world price of oil has risen by 52 percent, and last month a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the inflation rate will drop from 2.1, this year to 2.5 percent, but in 2009 it will drop to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, the next 3 to 4 months the annual average rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut the key rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) increased significantly at the beginning of December. Since 2002, he currently has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Poll Institute) has never before seen such low socialist support, namely 13 percent.
For loyal voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of opposition voters, support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against support of one-fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP. (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent across the population.
Of loyal voters certain to vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate from the previous low point, the proportion of those who judged the country&#39;s economic situation to be particularly serious has never been so high, it amounts to 41 percent and according to 46 percent complementary the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of last spring and summer, families are once again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population foresees a worsening and only a tenth foresees an improvement of the situation.
Last December, 71 percent of those polled, a majority unseen in previous Gallup polls, thought the prime minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the prime minister at all and 27 percent the president of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society believing that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be dealt with without a change of government.
While after last October&#39;s riots, 35 percent of those polled wanted the government and prime minister to remain in office, currently that rate is only 20 percent. The relative majority (33 percent) believe that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
When asked about the intention to vote, 60 percent of those polled answered that they would definitely vote and the remaining 20 percent said that they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a &quot;legislative election to be held next Sunday&quot;, only 55 percent of those polled would certainly participate and an additional 15 percent would probably participate. According to current intentions, the result of the referendum would not be in doubt.
74 percent of people would say no to higher education tuition fees, 79 percent would say no to consultation fees and 84 percent would say no to hospital stay fees.
When we look only at the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters, respectively, would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and living expenses at the hospital.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
Hypermarkets located in the Budaörs shopping triangle maintained last year&#39;s average price increase of 16 percent, except that this year the VAT rate did not increase.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the usual daily Christmas basket also increased by 16 percent on average, an increase in value clearly exceeding one thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
Prices, &quot;which had already soared&quot; in large grocery stores last December, no longer rose sharply from the previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased well below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
Unicum and live fish prices remained almost at last year&#39;s level, however prices for turkey fillet, walnuts and poppy seeds rose sharply.
In stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, we found bread weighing one kilo at only 139 forints.
The competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the two-liter bottle of Coca-Cola was under 200 forints, so it only cost 257 forints including the bottle with deposit.
However, this year, in terms of daily basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the least expensive.
According to our calculations, Cora has increased the price of its Daily Basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan have increased them by around 18 and 18 percent respectively.
Comparing last year&#39;s most expensive basket to this year&#39;s cheapest basket, we see a 12 percent difference while the difference between last year&#39;s cheapest and this year&#39;s most expensive is 21 percent.
Prices rose by 1,480 forints on average.
Last year, prices increased by 1,206 forints on average, although the impact of the increase in the VAT rate was already noticeable in last year&#39;s Christmas prices.
This process perplexed trade, hypermarkets could not visibly determine what margin to apply on products as they were unable to predict the impact of price changes on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the turnover of a product, he risks losing a big profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in the VAT rate, the increase in the prices of the Daily basket evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than the value of that of 2006, while the difference between the baskets the cheapest was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive since the value of the most expensive basket was higher by 1,630 forints than last year and the prices of the cheapest increased by 1,284 forints as well.
Bringing the two Christmas seasons together, we have seen a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of everyday consumer items have increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH&#39;s data: for some staple foods, the statistics institute has seen a price increase of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, of flour and eggs.)
According to the latter&#39;s Daily Basket, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indices, the suppliers of flour occupy a stronger position than the suppliers of eggs because they succeeded in making accept the brutal increase in prices also by the multinationals.
In the commercial golden triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain, they consistently record good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at the prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-life foods on pallets.
On Wednesday morning, large queues formed at the checkouts of the three hypermarkets because the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, turnover is lower in the provinces, many multinationals complain to survey companies that they do not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for articles of sustainable consumption.
Many hospitals are saving money on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overwork of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the chief doctor of the National Center of Epidemiology.
Many hospitals are also saving on disinfectants
Not long ago an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected in a man hospitalized following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured in a serious car accident was discharged from hospital but soon after had to return due to an MRSA infection and since then doctors have not been able to perform major surgery on him due to bacteria in his body.
Until December 10 this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by a multidrug-resistant pathogen have been reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, chief physician of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Namely, it is the number of infections caused by a multidrug-resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two thirds of the infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, in other words by methicillin-oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
A third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing disease.
Infections caused by AS (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if the antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacterium, which reacts well to the antibiotics, will develop a bacterium which is well resistant to the antibiotics and which will proliferate rapidly in the poor hospital conditions.
In the event of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as a traumatic infection or septicemia, in elderly patients, those with low weight or those with a weakened organism.
According to the medical director of the János hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily life of hospitals.
It is important not to confuse the infection with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA only where we do not look for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
AS are resistant to antibiotics.
&quot;These patients are isolated, the medical staff put on rubber gloves and protective masks and we have suitable antibiotics to treat them,&quot; said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, however the infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample taking is not fashionable
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current conditions and circumstances are not favorable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multidrug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and residences for the elderly, hospitals should monitor hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these examinations.
Most cases only arise if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief doctor of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are Hungarian guidelines also for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, ie microbiological examinations should be carried out in order to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Taking microbiological samples is even rarer in outpatient care and basic care, Karolina Böröcz communicated.
Many hospitals are saving money on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA proliferate from patient to patient most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put on gloves and protective masks. However, major shortcomings are detected in hospitals also in this area.
MRSA proliferate by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, due to the conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other, whereas in terms of an epidemic, the patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other.
Unfortunately, we also see that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, are saving money on disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many patients, so the risk of contamination is even greater, indicated Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals where preventive measures are observed, the number of infections is demonstrably lower or the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of the MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenses for the social security funds, which is why we fight everywhere against this infection.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) lists among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens (such as MRSA) as well as the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The superintendent, author of a fatal accident, was not in a state of intoxication
The official statement relating to the fatal accident caused by the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement has been drawn up.
It can be excluded that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who has since resigned from his post, who ran over a pedestrian causing his death last Tuesday, would have driven in a state of drunkenness or dizzy, communicated Friday Attila Morvai, spokesperson for the Ministry audience of the capital after the relative report has been established.
The report confirmed the first result of the investigation which has already found that the ex-commissioner had not consumed alcohol before getting behind the wheel
Last Tuesday, the former head of the 22nd district police station ran over a 55-year-old man who found himself in front of him when he turned, with his personal car, into Kossuth Lajos street in the 22nd district. The man wanted to cross the road by not going through the pedestrian crossing.
(Besides, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing does not constitute a mitigating circumstance, according to the Highway Code a car which initiates a turn must let pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being taken to hospital.
Following this accident, the superintendent resigned from his post and he asked for his retirement because, according to the communication of the police, this accident upset him a lot.
The investigation into this case is being carried out by the Prosecutor&#39;s Office in charge of investigations in Budapest.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former commissioner cooperated from the start with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
400 million additional euros for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian finance minister, and Marta Gajecka, vice-president of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed, on Friday in Budapest, three agreements worth a total of 400 million euros concerning a credit to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure, and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of 300 million euros for the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environment projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, including a credit contract of value of 100 million euros has already been signed by the parties. This time, the signed contract concerns the use of the remaining 200 million euros.
The agreement on the credit of 150 million euros also concerns the budgetary financing of projects linked to education.
The EIB has approved a total of 300 million euros for Hungary, the remaining 150 million euros can be used later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a contract of 50 million euros for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope in the first place within the framework of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the metro line 4 project was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would discuss the possible modification of the initial contract once Hungary has finalized the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted a total of EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its credits according to the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without commitment commission.
Bulgaria, paradise of the EU real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of all Europe is turned towards this country of the Balkans little quoted in the past.
What, where and who buys in this EU market which is still the cheapest but will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is unquestionably the hottest target in Eastern Europe with its cheap ski apartments and seaside houses.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albéna, the &quot;Golden Sands&quot;, the &quot;Sun Coast&quot;, the old Sozopol and Nessebar but they are more and more numerous to look for a building in the region of Kavarna and Balcik as well.
According to Re/Max Bulgaria analysts, sooner or later the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also arouse the interest of investors and more and more of them are also buying in the a very inexpensive corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, retail and office space promises the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus to be a priority destination, after the summer season and the winter season, also in the other two seasons of the country. &#39;year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria seek at the same time to change their life, their way of life.
Most of the buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the shores of the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers fall into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional manager of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who intend to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price varying between 50 and 100 thousand euros, or old dilapidated houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are the easy access and the possibilities of communication, the proximity of a big city, the shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of second homes (since last December, Bulgaria has been listed among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of realizing a gain in the medium or long term.
The price of buildings in the capital is constantly rising due to ever-increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, over the past 5 years, they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices essentially exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Hungarian Six Percent
According to the communication of Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Waters, the meetings of the professionals end on Tuesday, however, on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the regime of the international climate after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians arriving from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap, which is supposed to define the efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, lively discussions are taking place on this subject between developing and developed countries.
The United States also indicated that, for the moment, they did not wish to discuss exact figures, however that they were ready to sign an agreement on the reduction, until 2020, of greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent above the 1990 level.
Another important subject of the conference is to see if the developed countries commit themselves, apart from reducing emissions, to providing financial and technological assistance to the countries which need it.
An agreement was also signed concerning aid to be provided to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a board of directors composed of 16 members probably within the framework of the Global Environment Fund of the United Nations (GEF), communicated Piac és Profit (Market and Profit).
Hungary&#39;s Six Percent
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Waters, confirms the EU&#39;s ambition to maintain its role as flagship in the global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new agreement internationally before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to the level reached in 1990, regardless of the success of the signing of the &quot;Agreement after 2012”, and it was ready to reduce them by up to 30 percent if the other major regions of the world and/or the developing countries were also ready to make commitments commensurate with their responsibilities and capacities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the signatory countries of the Kyoto Protocol had aimed in total for a reduction of 5.2 percent and all of the 15 members of the EU at that time made the commitment out of 8 for hundred less.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the level of the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfill its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment .
The stakes are high in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be implemented within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed until after 2012. In this In this case, reduction commitments below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international system for reducing emissions, the need for which has been underlined in the new report by the IPCC, an international scientific body, which won the UN Nobel Peace Prize for addressing climate change.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and an increase in the Earth&#39;s average temperature of more than 2 degrees celcius could no longer be avoided, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
The British Army recruits on YouTube
British army units share recordings made during their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan on the video-sharing site in a bid to make themselves popular.
First, it was the British Air Force (RAF) that was passionate about YouTube: the special units intervening in Afghanistan upload video sequences on the operations carried out against the Taliban since March 2006, announced the BBC.
These recordings, taken using miniature helmet-mounted cameras, are monitored at the air force&#39;s operations headquarters in Kandahar and then transferred to London where compatriots upload them to the Internet.
The political message is essential
The air force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net through this channel and their &quot;channel&quot; has been watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defense registered there under the name of &quot;defenceheadquarters&quot; in the spring of 2007 and it provides videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Office and international peacekeeping forces for Peace in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channel on YouTube.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the original purpose of the air force, the videos were posted on the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they also served to inform the general public of the real objectives of the presence of the army abroad.
Propaganda published in this way costs practically nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements shown on television, communicated to the BBC Gordon Mackenzie, defense consultant. On the other hand, it also inevitably carries a political message since it justifies in a special form the validity of the military operations decided by the government.
Americans made a game
The army is annoyed because, apart from the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos are shown on the sharing site which also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the &quot;official&quot; propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
Moreover, many videos had already passed on the net presenting the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan which were carried out in real mission, but the British army is carried away for the loading of these videos only recently.
Americans do recruiting a little differently using the free downloadable shootout game America&#39;s Army. In this game the player can put himself directly in the place of the soldiers within the framework of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas raffle and donuts in the ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labor, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold an end-of-year meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 by taking donuts and coffee.
Another department will host a party with live music, yet another will delight officials with a raffle and offer a drink to set the Christmas mood.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, this is how power is entertained.
The public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defense but it is not the employees of the ministry who will be invited.
At Christmas, Orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for Missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The ministry provides a budget of 25 million forints to create the atmosphere of the end of the year.
In comparison with the other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM party will be held in the Future House with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints, and of the six hundred or so employees, three hundred and fifty are expected there.
During this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be required, there will be actors and also a raffle.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was organized on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Justice (ILO) with concerts and a dinner.
The hall rental cost one million forints, the rest was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a service of the NFÜ is invited to another Christmas party which is organized with European money by the National Center for Economic Development, the company managing calls for tenders.
The Théâtre de la Gaîté building was rented for this purpose.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have not been able to reach the manager.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building not only housed the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and the Police which, instead of a Christmas party, organized a ball on the occasion of Saint Luca, on 7 December.
The ILO did not charge them for the use of its rooms.
This ball numbered five hundred people.
The party began with the minister&#39;s words of welcome and dinner was followed by a dance party to live music.
Answer to [origo]&#39;s question: evening dress was not at all compulsory at this ball.
The ministries of health, labor and local communities are preparing a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, within its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labor, does not officially invite her collaborators to a Christmas party but to a work meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected who will be invited to have a coffee and eat donuts, the press service communicated, the party will thus cost only 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Authorities, will quite simply invite his collaborators to have a drink in the aula of the Ministry of Local Authorities and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas party in its main hall where 436 employees are expected.
He plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
No party atmosphere planned, the official character is reinforced not only by the presentation of the minister but also by the hour of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the New Year, the Christmas party will not take place.
The reception will be held at the castle of Vajdahunyad, located in the Bois de ville, and according to the communication from the ministry, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, it will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, begin with a few words of welcome from the Minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas at all, the respective press services communicated to [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the party organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike gather
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers&#39; Councils will set up their strike committee on Friday, which will be responsible for coordinating the indefinite strike on Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest meeting will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the law relating to health funds, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause major traffic jams because rail traffic will be almost completely stopped and the employees of BKV (public transport company) will also go on strike until 1 p.m.
The Unions of the league will make known, Friday afternoon, the details of their strike on Monday, organized with the National Association of Workers&#39; Councils.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also be constituted, it will serve as coordinator of Monday&#39;s actions.
Saturday, a general assembly of protest will be held and, from Monday, the organizations joining has the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they do not manage to find an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the law relating to health funds, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the law on health funds, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide what action to take.
According to Monday&#39;s agenda for the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the law relating to health funds will not take place until late evening, or even at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, major traffic jams are expected: the railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of the public transport in Budapest and more than half of the companies Volán are in danger of being arrested.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined in the call for a strike, the list of which is constantly updated on the League&#39;s website.
Some organizations report going on strike for an indefinite period, others have declared a temporary work stoppage.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) failed to reach an agreement on minimum services, however, with the approach of Christmas, more and more people are taking the train.
According to current communications, Budapest public transport will be on strike from the start of service until 1 p.m., Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the Industrial Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will be on strike four hours, the Teachers&#39; Union and the Democratic Teachers&#39; Union called for a strike for 2 hours and from 2 to 8 hours respectively.
The National Association of Doctors will strike across the country alternately, the Union of Health and Social Sector Employees (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will carry out a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands, formulated by the League, demands that the government withdraw its proposal for health reform and submit a new concept to social debate.
The second demand requires that the new method of calculating the pension to be put in place from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third demand wants a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, which would make it possible to pass into the system the functions which deserve it before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), attached to the Unions of the League, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased country risk
According to the Risk Analyzing Division of Political Capital (Risk Analyzing Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a better Hungary) increases, in several aspects, the risk politics of Hungary and the region.
In its &quot;risk warning&quot;, the company points out that, in connection with the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that &quot;in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes may occur as a result of the worsening of the ethnic tension already existing between the gypsy and non-gypsy population of Hungary”.
The research institute added that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard presumably aiming to provoke this situation is the main reason for this.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of the Hungarian political actors: &quot;the public actors passed the public debate on the Roma affair to the representatives of the radical and extreme political groupings which based a political strategy on the dispute between the Gypsies and the Hungarians”.
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, under the effect of the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard &quot;has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, in particular with regard to trust in the stability and democratic maturity of the country&quot;.
They recall that, following greater publicity given to the reorganization of Hungarian radical and extreme right groups since the autumn of 2006, many associations have been set up in Hungary since the summer of 2007 calling themselves the &quot;national association of &#39;self-defense&#39;.
&quot;The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization while they publicly declare the preparation of their members for defense missions (disasters, national defense, defense of order), armed if necessary. it is necessary, moreover, by evoking the inaptitude of the police, the army, in other words of the state”, they added.
They pointed out that everything was happening according to the method which, based on the resentment of the society of politics and parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions under a civil aspect.
The emphasis on the civil character and the status of association therefore only serves to avoid the legal pitfalls of registering these associations in court, but they also constitute a political strategy.
The analysis points out that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighborhood relations.
“In recent months, many neighboring countries cite the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighboring countries wish to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influences the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The numerous Roma troubles which broke out in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are at the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the BNU decided to form a guard saying that the objective of the organization is “national self-defense”.
According to them, over the past 17 years, the gypsies have &quot;terrorized&quot; Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked heated debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement of some Bulgarian Roma organizations regarding the formation of their own guard as a resistance signals the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that the Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, can be read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
Asked for information from the telegraph agency, Attila Juhász, research director of Political Capital, said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events occur which could have an impact on the change in risk, they inform the public opinion, as in the present case, by publishing a warning of risk.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days, the number of which will decrease next year.
The holidays are not uniform in the EU and the United States either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays as well as days of rest.
Days of rest are often linked to religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that is ending and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, the latter all the more so that the revelers can rest quietly.
Moreover, in a year, we have in all eleven feasts marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday, in commemoration of the 1848 revolution, as is October 23, which is the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the incorporation of our state, May 1 is Labor Day, and on November 1 and 2, we remember our deceased family members and friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our state, national, or even religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, depending on the calendar, it has become common to rearrange working days in cases where there is only one working day left before or after the party marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price for long weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday before the long weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labor has ruled in special regulations on the days to replace the days preceding or following the holidays.
The law extends to all employers and to all their salaried employees, to civil servants and to persons working in the public service.
However, it does not apply to service companies, institutions running without interruption and in service, by virtue of their vocation, and also for rest days.
This year, the working days will be modified only around the end of the year holidays: from December 24, life comes to a standstill almost in the whole country because according to experience the majority of people rather work overtime or take holidays they have saved for these purposes so that they can spend the days between Christmas and New Year&#39;s Day at home.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized the first time around Labor Day to allow employees to stay at home four days in a row.
Saturday April 25 will be a working day to have a rest day on Friday May 2.
Another change is planned for October 23: Saturday October 18 will be a working day replacing Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year promises to be festive because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if New Year&#39;s Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six trivial things that can annoy colleagues terribly
Emails that we forget to send, voicemails that we never receive, innocent lies that annoy us almost more: these are things that &quot;beautify&quot; the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether one gets used to these troubles or one takes up the challenge and consciously avoids ambiguous situations, causing trouble for others.
Examples.
“Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that we called you from the marketing department,” a colleague tells you.
That you missed an appointment?
At best he&#39;s sorry and tries to make things right by calling the marketing department to tell them he forgot to pass on the message (this is the least common solution).
In the majority of cases, the thing is arranged with an apology.
Before having painful explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and to make efforts to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that doesn&#39;t belong to you?
There&#39;s nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool or the phone and you can&#39;t find it anywhere.
Do you remember how the night before you put the stapler on the desk but it disappeared the next morning?
Do you find your pen by chance that you thought was lost on your colleague&#39;s desk?
Don&#39;t take anything from your colleagues without asking otherwise they are right to be angry with you for stealing their property.
Do not bring back envelopes, post-it in your pocket because it can be annoying that there are no more and that you need them right away.
Do you gossip about the privacy of colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop gossip from spreading.
Who did what, with whom?
Where and why?
Do not tell everyone your information (assumptions) about the private lives of your colleagues!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don&#39;t abuse his trust!
Bury the information shared in you and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues are also aware.
Are you claiming to be ill without just cause?
When you call the office and claim to be ill on the pretext of a heartbreaking headache because you feel bad or think you need a rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent business, your missions have term must be done by someone else for you.
Don&#39;t bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you won&#39;t be going to work or that something may happen that would force you to stay at home, don&#39;t forget to tell your boss and your colleagues to avoid surprise. of your absence the next day.
Humming, giggling, telephone
You immerse yourself in your work but the sneer of your colleagues tears you away brutally?
You became, unwittingly, a witness to a telephone discussion that you would have done better not to listen to?
Don&#39;t bother your co-workers with humming, humming, talking aloud (that you lead over their heads), kicking your feet, swearing or speaking out loud.
They can disturb even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Do you blame others for a fault?
If your work is not done by the set deadline, you forget to send an important letter or message, do not blame anyone for this oversight!
Don&#39;t blame it on the potential chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Admit it if you made a mistake and if it caused inconvenience to others, fix the mistake!
Ask how you could repair your fault, repair the negligence!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Wearing jogging and slippers is comfortable at home but they are not suitable for the office!
Do not put on comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Don&#39;t be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your job requires it, by putting on pretty and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to live up to expectations, you&#39;re no longer interesting
We are moving slowly through the usual morning traffic jam.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I turn up the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the earlier tones, then a female choir joins in like a real gem.
Mr2 is streaming Zagar&#39;s song Wings of Love.
Hungarian musical life did not spoil us for a long time with good quality electronic pop.
However, now it seems that the cork becomes different if you listen to the new Zagar album.
With the appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born out of the Hungarian digital underground are slowly starting to change the overall picture and, despite the new fashion for guitar-ripping garage rock, Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and was playing in Yonderboi&#39;s band himself before he set off on his own path, perhaps because &quot;there is no room for two feet in one shoe &quot;.
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, were beginning to make themselves known when he was entrusted with the composition of the filmed soundtracks (eg.
The season of Ferenc Török).
The formation playing at the beginning in small clubs began to be known by a larger public when the magazine wan2 quoted their first album of 2002 among the fifty most important discs of the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the quasi only creators of the Hungarian tendency which would also be competitive in the west.
Zagar and his ensemble have become undeniably &quot;trendy&quot; but no one has asked them if they would like to wear this label.
The band reacted as it should, they released a new and better record.
The album entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, released recently, can open new paths for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line from Balázs Zságer&#39;s former Pécs band.
We are there with the reference to flight but alongside the aerial music now appears, following the spirit and the trend of the time, the stronger guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, singer currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the premiere of the album at Millennium Park.
On the album, we find a real hit for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, recently broadcasting popular music from morning to night, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers (&quot;Underground Divas&quot;) .
Everything is fine then (?).
hvg.hu posed questions to Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit pushes me to ask a question: has your music really remained a music aimed at a certain level?
Zságer Balázs: The term music aimed at a certain layer doesn&#39;t mean much to me.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
So-called alternative, underground music can also be mediocre and made only to sell it and thus become commercial.
However, a good pop song can be sincere too.
The attitude of reception works in this spirit also independently of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the West, light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only the young people of ten or twenty years but also the oldest.
They follow the changes that have taken place in light music much more closely because they believe that it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, where and how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I&#39;m obviously happy to see that more and more people are coming to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve an objective but for a precise reason.
The role of the public is more important at concerts where the mutual influence already works but it is only perceived in the elusive changes of the moment.
However, I noticed that if you wanted to meet the expectations of the public, you will no longer be interesting.
hvg.hu: Do you plan to follow Yonderboi&#39;s example?
He works alone and has made a career in the west.
Zs.B.: We don&#39;t really follow his path even if sometimes some people try to find traces in our music.
We are rather team players who trust in the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
At the beginning, it was of course inevitable that our music would be compared to that of Yonderboi because many of us left his band and took another path.
hvg.hu: On mr2 Petõfi&#39;s charts, Wings of Love is number one.
Many people first heard Zagar&#39;s name through this song.
With this more popular style you consciously opened up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn&#39;t plan to make a hit in order to be able to sell the record.
This song means more things.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes tackled throughout the disc.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
We had the idea of composing this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus was composed the choir with six members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, which was then baptized Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls modify it a bit?
Zs.B.: This song had already existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought that there was still something missing from this song.
The chord progression drew the vocals from the song.
I sang the same night the melody that the girls learned later.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me at the time but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice it would not have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert also it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except for a brief solo by Judy Jay), they have no solo roles, they all sing together, and they sing no louder than the music, so the music does not just accompany their singing.
They were back on stage too.
Is it wanted?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is only due to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary is that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we have to forget our ego a bit, forget who comes from where, who goes where, we just have to let these wings, the wings of love, carry us.
I wanted others to also feel that euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: To be honest, none about the music creation process, we had some more difficult songs when mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray&#39;s Dilemma, where I play a concert piano, or with Rock&#39;n&#39;Roll Goes To The Girls, where the groove didn&#39;t want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything fell apart. set up like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I&#39;ve already &quot;dropped&quot; this record.
Right now they are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The treacherous trader risked billions because of his inferiority complex
A concealing fraudster.
This is the name of his former employee, the French giant Société Générale, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost almost five billion euros because of him.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to equal his colleagues, and who, in addition, can in no way be considered incapable.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market in time.
&quot;He is fragile,&quot; suggested his superiors who reported him to the police.
However, if we stick to the deposition of Kerviel reported by the French media, including Le Monde, the transactions of this man produced at the end of last year a profit amounting to 1.6 billion euros. euros.
The crisis goes beyond the United States
&quot;All I wanted was to make money for my bank,&quot; he claims in the deposition.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the American crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he sensed the opportunity early on in the year.
Reports began to emerge in February that so-called “sub-prime” mortgages, granted to low-income customers or those who had experienced repayment difficulties in the past, were having problems.
But this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and he bet well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
&quot;As soon as I had won my first half-billion, I didn&#39;t know how to announce it,&quot; confides Kerviel and adds that he, of course, kept nothing for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits to having distorted the reports so as not to be detected.
He managed to fool his superiors, although the Eurex stock exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Was he afraid of being discovered?
Rather not.
&quot;I felt that just getting 1.6 billion for the bank was going to satisfy them.&quot;
Where does his willingness to risk so big come from?
He came to his post only gradually.
He started working at Société Générale in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around 51 thousand dollars.
Two years later he was already an assistant trader, and in 2005 he became a freelance trader with an annual salary of 90 thousand dollars.
Yet he knew he would never earn as much as the others.
&quot;From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was much less considered than the others.
In view of my university course and my professional and personal career,&quot; Kerviel told investigators.
However, shortly after taking office, he achieved his first great success.
Thanks to Allianz shares, he won half a billion euros by betting on the fall in this title during the attacks in London.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you in peace
“There was like a snowball effect,” he told the police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they suspected it.
&quot;As long as I was winning, they pretended to close their eyes.&quot;
However, it is then that the blow of the beginning of the year occurs.
He loses a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to conceal the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer an employee of the bank.
A few days later, the bank announces that it has lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how did we find out?
He became suspect because of his leave.
“Last year, I only took 4 days off.
A trader who does not take a vacation is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another&quot;, concludes Kerviel.
Czechia has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech government ministers signed a total of nine operational programs with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total sum that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion crowns from seven operational programs will be earmarked for Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation program.
The transport sector will benefit from the largest share, up to 150 billion.
The transport program is the most important operational program and represents up to 22 percent of the financial means that the Rep. Czech can get under these projects.
This money will be the source of an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund which will manage next year a sum of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, intended for SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to obtain financial means to encourage innovation within the company.
Companies should obtain financial means for the introduction of new technologies, research in the industry, but also for the introduction of new, more efficient management methods.
So far, the Rep. Czech Republic was among the least successful recipients of EU funds among new members.
Tribunal upholds 20-year prison sentence for ex-Nicaragua president
Nicaragua&#39;s Court of Appeals on Thursday upheld the 20-year prison sentence for the country&#39;s former president Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for fraud of 100 million dollars (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
However, he was later released and was living under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether or not the former head of this Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be imprisoned again is unclear for the moment, according to the AP agency.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on the prison agents, either they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or go back to prison.
4 years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alemán regularly moved government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These were shell companies and the accounts actually belonged to his family members and closest supporters.
Some of that money went into funds that Alemán had set up to finance his election campaign in 2001.
We passed the budget
This is how.
The state budget has been adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
That for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford his refusal.
Unlike the heated debate preceding the vote on the declaration of no confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies passed without any problem this law which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
This is a kind of paradox.
Whether we like it or not, each chapter and each article constitutes the beginning and the end of all government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, although hidden behind the power competition between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that is why we give it more attention in the media.
Disputes between politicians interest the public much more than abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three ills that the current budget is unable to address at once:
The first being the significant share granted to the costs of mandates imposed by law, consisting not only of pensions, but also of social charges, adopted last year by the silent &quot;coalition&quot; of the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second being a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle is constituted by the deficit of public finances, ie by the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit of the state budget that represents the greatest hazard.
This one is public and relatively under control.
The real time bomb is the deficit of cities and towns.
Many mayors often issued bonds in a dizzy fashion, inordinately indebting their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from the money coming from taxes, fiscal rights and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In past years, they succeeded in reimbursing these debts through the mass sale of shares in the distribution systems, in particular those of energy, obtained from the State within the framework of the privatizations.
Today, they no longer have this source.
If we stick only to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has already been going through a phase of growth for several years, just like the rest of the world, and ČSSD does not fail to brag about it.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
However, instead of that, they indebted the State more and more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions like Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous disgrace that essentially falls on previous governments.
We are one of the countries which, on a global scale, are the least threatened by poverty.
We therefore have no need for massive social programs which, in recent years, have unfortunately been unnecessarily inflated.
Although some of the absurd populist spending approved last year before the elections has been eliminated, if a shift in the retirement age limit and a reform of the pension system will not have not take place soon, then all politics will cease to exist in this country and whoever is in power, he will only administer.
With a slight exaggeration, one can say that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the taxed money between pensions and social benefits.
This is the reason why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes ordinary fees to be pushed back by warrant fees.
The $70 billion deficit projected for 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments had not squandered all the money they could.
If we really do not want the politicians in power to become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and grant this fragile government coalition, aware that the State can only spend the equivalent of what it succeeds in levying in taxes and fiscal rights, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
Only the latter will make it possible to gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than one hundred billion dollars will thus be placed on the money markets through auctions.
The banks will have to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are ready to borrow money.
For example, the American Fed will auction 40 billion dollars and, in addition, it will provide 24 billion to the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time since the attacks of September 11 that the Central Banks of individual States have decided on such concerted action, aimed at preventing or even reducing the effects of the financial crisis.
&quot;This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend&quot;, writes in his report to clients Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group.
&quot;The concerted action of central banks has reduced the probability of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent,&quot; adds Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost 60 billion dollars because of defaulted loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts still expect further losses in the billions.
&quot;If central banks have chosen this approach, it is because they really need to understand what may still follow,&quot; said NBA chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
&quot;It seems that the situation is really bad,&quot; he adds.
Central banks fear that, if the banks themselves will have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the US economy into a recession that could affect economic growth worldwide.
Central Banks made this choice after they failed to lower the London interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that the banks were still afraid of borrowing from each other, despite the fact that the American, Canadian and English central banks had lowered their interest rates on several occasions during the autumn.
&quot;It will have the same effect as a further drop in interest rates,&quot; Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks&#39; approach will not help avert the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem, which is the fall in the real estate market in the USA.
President Klaus: The debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change is believed to harm developing countries especially.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke out on the issue of global warming.
The criticism fell this time on the United Nations international conference on climate change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The blue planet, not green, he stated that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, made up of a curious mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric the companion and reality.
&quot;The debate is not structured at all, it&#39;s just a rocket of words, ersatz solutions to current problems,&quot; said Klaus.
The Czech president underlined, during the presentation of his book, that his subject is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appeared in German translation, since, he said, &quot;I often only encounter the caricature of my opinions&quot;.
Now, interested people can read his positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless, in his opinion, has enough dispositions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academician capable of following and appreciating scientific treatises, he is experienced in statistics and he is also an economist.
The major conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following theses: the climate is constantly changing, the changes in it are therefore normal, there is not an opinion shared by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too large nor too serious, so they do not represent any danger and, finally, efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
Especially since having experienced a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he explained on several occasions that he was not against &quot;reasonable protection of the environment, but against fundamentalist environmentalism which does not take into consideration the relationship between costs and the profit that &#39;they bring&quot;.
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this subject two months ago, at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to renew their driver&#39;s license on time
Six hundred thousand drivers let the deadline expire and failed to renew their old driving license, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
This is the last day people can still apply for renewal, so the authorities will be able to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid license will use the road.
According to the authorities, their driving license has not been renewed, especially those who no longer wish to drive.
While the municipalities are reporting a drop in the number of permit renewal applications, authorities in the capital are flooded with requests and the number of permit renewal applications has increased this week.
The Town Hall satisfies around 2,000 customers a day.
There is a queue of about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140,000 drivers have not yet renewed their driving licenses.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request delivery within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Drivers of vehicles who fail to carry out the compulsory renewal of their driving license by the end of the year and who drive on the road without a valid license will risk a fine as of January.
The culprit will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer can also deal with the offense by resorting to an amicable approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine increases to 2500 crowns.
According to old information, was liable to a fine even a person who was not going to circulate.
In doing so she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities for moderation and to impose fines not exceeding 1,000 crowns.
However, according to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one risks fines in the tens of thousands.
The driver&#39;s license is, in his view, a document that people can decide whether they want to have or not.
It is not like with the identity card which must be valid without exceptions.
People who no longer wish to drive should surrender their driver&#39;s license.
Just bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving license.
People with documents dating from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to renew.
The validity of driving licenses issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Court reduced the sentences of the detectives pacted with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police officers accused of collusion with the gang of David Berdych, will respectively serve thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Higher Court of Prague thus sentenced them definitively by reducing their sentences respectively by 1 and 2 years.
Originally, detectives from the Department for the Fight against Organized Crime faced sentences of 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment pronounced today, only an appeal to the Superior Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is currently only awaiting the first instance verdict.
However, he has already received in other trials sentences amounting to more than 16 years in prison.
He cannot receive more.
In January, the Departmental Court convicted 19 people of participating in hold-ups, the Higher Court is now processing the appeals of 16 of them.
Since the start of the investigation, most of the defendants have questioned the accusation, claiming that it was a manipulated affair.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, members of the police, after an agreement with Berdych among others, passed on information from police sources to criminals, covered up various hold-ups and helped gang members avoid responsibility criminal.
The gang would in return hand over 30 percent of the theft to Opava and Koňařík.
The charge relates to the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
Mainly armed robberies whose victims have, in most cases, suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of power by a public official and prohibited weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegally detained pistols, shells with a steel core, a sight for direct laser fire or a submachine gun.
According to the charges, the gang enriched themselves with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from nearly two dozen men in this trial, the courts have already found guilty of other robberies Berdych and a whole series of other people.
Other men from the neighborhood of Berdych are still explaining themselves in court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached court.
The main hearing avoided, for the time being, Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej who are currently living in detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of surrogate children: 12 million
The lawyer of the families affected Igor Veleba wants to obtain from the hospital of Třebíč a compensation of 12 million crowns plus the costs.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why hospital lawyer Ondřej Dostál strongly disagrees with Veleba&#39;s proposal.
&quot;We refuse such a claim, it is very, very high,&quot; Dostál said after the hearing.
&quot;To be able to form an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report which the opposing party has commissioned to be drawn up.
We are going to see if this has any explanatory value.
But we continue to believe that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands,&quot; Dostál stressed.
The amount should, according to him, be fixed between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the start of the case, Jabloňov&#39;s family demanded one million crowns for each month that they could not raise their biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, drawn up for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the compensation negotiations.
According to psychology and psychiatry experts, the parents suffered psychological damage and were prone to stress at different scales and depths.
The stressful situation was better tolerated by the men, although they were confronted with remorse for not having been able to prevent the substitution of the newborns.
Women, they remain less serene in the face of the experience of the trauma in the news and in front of what is happening precisely at this moment, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were substituted by nurses at Třebíč hospital on December 9th.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
The governor of the region Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil handed over, at the end of October, to each of the families 100,000 crowns for the reimbursement of the expenses caused by the error of the hospital of Třebíč managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are required by law to have civil liability insurance.
In case of default, they must draw from the reserve fund, exceptionally, they can ask the manager for help.
Until now the courts recognized relatively low compensation, the sums calculated according to the tables were of the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Valašské Království (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the trademark Valašské království (Kingdom of Valašsko).
According to the judge of the regional court of Ostrava, it is indeed him who had used for the first time the title King of Valašsko, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, former collaborator of the actor.
Polívka was not present at today&#39;s hearing.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
&quot;The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team parasitize on the popularity of Bolek Polívka,&quot; Polívka&#39;s lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Valašsko remind everyone of this actor and comedian.
Harabiš agrees.
“There is almost ten years of work behind us.
Searching for money and setting up events,” he said.
According to him, it is the money that is the cause of the dispute.
&quot;After years, they realized that the project is successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to interfere with our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who first used the title valašský král (King of Valašsko) in his TV show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him king in 1993.
However, at the time, this had nothing to do with the project of setting up a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Valašské Království passports.
From a humorous action at the origin came a business and a lucrative commercial activity, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka accepted that his name and his signature be quoted in the passport and he even offered holders sales on the price of the visit to his farm and his theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the bare idea, published by Polívka in the show manéž, for commercial purposes.
&quot;The popularity of Boleslav Polívka has certainly helped the Valašské království project,&quot; the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who were intensely dedicated to the project.
The collaboration between the now enemy sides continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka an official coronation in Vsetín.
But from then on, conflicts began to build up between Polívka a Harabiš, which culminated in the deposition of &quot;king Boleslav 1st elected forever&quot;.
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court has now dismissed.
What could clear up the matter is the tournament being considered for the throne and one half of the princess.
A new king should emerge.
He didn&#39;t want to betray the details and the date yet.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to go fast.
it would be something like the parade of kings in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a certain time.
Even Mr. Polívka can of course register,&quot; added Harabiš.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
To be honest, I&#39;ve never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its ride qualities were nothing out of the ordinary, shifting quality, ride quality and also build quality could in many ways be called below average.
However, currently there is on the market its successor the Peugeot 207 which is much better.
Especially since the combi named SW goes one step further, I just have to think better.
When I was testing the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, for example, I complained about the headroom in the rear seats.
While there the complaints are over because the combi bodywork means that even the big devils will, in this regard, be comfortable.
Let&#39;s see quickly
I&#39;m going to talk about the interior very quickly so as not to repeat myself too much.
This is a fairly successful design, my only remark relating to the central tunel which seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a bit more inventive design, given that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the days of complaining about too short seats or backrests are over.
Lateral guidance has also improved significantly over the 206 model.
As for space, the increase in the dimensions of the bodywork is noticeable there too.
The combi also sees the lack of space above the head already mentioned disappear.
A chest in the chest
The most important thing about this vehicle is therefore its luggage compartment.
I have to rate this as very well accessible (also thanks to the rear pivoting window) and rather easy stowage.
The blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics which constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while still being able to hold heavy items.
But let&#39;s stop at volume.
This is, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a rather average figure compared to the competition.
Apart from the Škoda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in this category in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mlada Boleslav, we see that the Peugeot remains very noticeably behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to going on vacation abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to highlight the advantages, I would mention the underbody that remained after the rear seat backs had been flipped perfectly straight, or a very low running board.
120 horsepower distributed over four cylinders
The automobile we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And truth be told, that&#39;s what a 1.6 that powers a family hatchback should look like.
It is silent, consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Škoda which often gives the impression of having an exhaust blocked by a mop, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Let&#39;s browse the rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, we must be aware that we tested a fairly well-equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The base price of a vehicle with a 1.4 liter Otto engine amounting to 329,900 Kč is still passable.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410,900 Kč, which is already quite enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 Kč.
However, we have also had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, automatic rear window control...
In reality, the vehicle ultimately costs 531,900 Kč.
That&#39;s a lot, but try adding the extra equipment to the Fabia&#39;s price and you&#39;ll get a very similar figure.
So all that remains is to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is not doing well
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is growing, causing residents to worry about the development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently coming up against a series of obstacles.
British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the original inhabitants turn into violence.
The case of North Kent, where the conflicts between local residents and immigrants of Slovak origin are beginning to intensify, illustrates well the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Arguments, squabbles and fights between students have carried over into relationships between parents.
The situation has gone so far that police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who beat a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The culprit defends herself by claiming that the boy had insulted her with rasist remarks.
The police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant led by two teenage girls.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks at the man and had thrown stones at him.
&quot;When we were going home, a young man climbed on the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he responded with apples and pears and then he bared his butt,” described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak pupils.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the residents went so far as to describe the conflicts with immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show that the atmosphere in British schools between the native inhabitants and the immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70,000 Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak pupils attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your holidays can come true if you make the right choice.
Golden and snow-white beaches, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Flippers and all inclusive with waiters offering you pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not only find this list in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Greater Antilles.
In Spanish times, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the depot and transshipment point for the treasures the Spaniards had stolen and were transporting to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was erected at the very beginning of the 1920s.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who had it built, since everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under prohibition) was allowed and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling of chance, prostitution.
Among his clients were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall buildings have grown and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 50s of the last century, circulated on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
Showbusiness stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
And today then?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita yourself.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed with the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars are still circulating in Havana, since the once imported jigoulis and fiats have already long since rotted in such a salty and humid climate.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is noticeably decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity are there as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings much-needed money, its development is given the green light.
During the last fifteen years, new hotels have sprung up not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of the Holguín province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and that will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane had been brought in from the extensive plantations in the sugar mills on a narrow gauge by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and it is thus that one can see small locomotives running there, the contemporaries of which are only in museums elsewhere.
Where to direct your steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the most famous places.
So there is no need to write much about Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise remember that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that whoever loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Viňales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
Exuberant vegetation grows there on limestone soil.
Mogotes, calcareous balloons and rocks rise in candle from the bottom of the valley, and, of the fertile ground having taken in their entrails, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense vegetable carpet.
The valley is where probably the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You will be able to encounter the final form of this product if you visit one of the cigar factories in Havana.
Someone might also find it interesting that the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was filmed there.
Trinidad
Ancient city founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
It was the market, the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought him fame and wealth.
Wealth is embodied in the beauty and showcase character of this small town.
Koloniální španělská architektura, výrazně ovlivněná pozdějšími francouzskými osadníky, se za čtyři staletí téměřnezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is such a remote place that even in the 50s of the last century there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay on the sidelines.
We weren&#39;t building anything, and that&#39;s why we weren&#39;t demolishing anything either, everyone was content to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more time in Trinidad than an afternoon, then it is also worth going to see interesting places in the surroundings, such as Playa Ancón beach or the Sugar Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música which comes alive after sunset and where the music only dies down in the early morning.
baracoa
Some refer to this town located in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful on the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads leading there from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and pass through a landscape almost unmarked by human activity.
UNESCO has inscribed the Eastern Cuba reef, thanks to its intact landscape, on the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is made there, in the church there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in fact, it was created about a hundred years after Columbus&#39; journey) and from the hill where the old castle and the current hotel El Castillo, we see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain range, the Bay of Sows and Isla de Pinos island, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of Cuba&#39;s patron saint Caridad del Cobre, Santeria , African religions practiced by the descendants of former slaves, about all this one could fill a number of pages.
Only, as they say, it is better to see once.
In Afghanistan, the allies are passive, say the Americans
The lack of soldiers and necessary equipment influences, according to the United States, the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the years to come.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as it should, representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
Alongside growing opposition from the Taliban movement, the eight states involved are also discussing future plans and allied coordination today.
While the United States this week through Defense Minister Robert Gates called on NATO troops to be more active, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the authority of the Afghan government and the intensification of development aid.
&quot;The development in Afghanistan is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to enable people to start new economic and security development themselves,&quot; British Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
ninety percent
Afghan insurgent activity is, according to US military data, the most intense in the past five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to last year, up to 60 percent in Helmand province, located in the south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40 thousand troops in Afghanistan, almost a quarter of them in the southern part.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit both in the organization and in the equipment of the troops.
Concretely, they ask for other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of the Afghan troops.
&quot;We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them,&quot; Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop made similar comments today.
&quot;I&#39;m not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and equipment we need, and that&#39;s not enough,&quot; De Hoop told Reuters at the end of talks with the government. Japanese in Tokyo which lasted three days.
who is passive
In recent months there have also been disputes between the countries involved over the question of whether all the allies are actually doing everything possible in Afghanistan.
For example Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
“The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where the violence is minimal, so the combat demands on them are not as rigorous as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate,” Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called German soldiers lazy.
&quot;Afghan slackers exposed: Germans play, while ours fight,&quot; Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went on the counterattack by publishing the photo of a British troop during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to one trillion in 2009
The burden of a state debt exceeding 84,000 crowns falls on every Czech.
The total debt rose, at the end of September, to 842.7 billion crowns.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
Thanks to better-than-expected progress in state budget savings, the ministry reduced the planned sum to 152.8 billion crowns.
The state debt of the Czech Republic rose towards the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
During the nine months of this year it has therefore increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, from the month of June, it fell by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its data on the State debt dating from the beginning of October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns falls on each Czech.
During the whole of last year, the State ran into debt of more than 111 billion crowns.
&quot;At the moment, it seems that, thanks to a lower deficit forecast for next year, we could exceed the border of a trillion crowns only in 2009.
Next year the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns,” Patria Finance analyst David Marek told the iHNed.cz server.
The forecast of Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikor is similar: &quot;We could exceed one trillion in the course of 2009.
The precise date will depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it appeared that the situation on the political scene changed, that the politicians were ready to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I&#39;m not waiting for this change,&quot; he said.
Debts are growing
The State debt is made up of central government debts and is essentially generated by the accumulation of State budget deficits.
The State debt is financed by treasury bonds, annuity securities, direct borrowings or, for example, by borrowings from the European Investment Bank.
The internal debt of the State has increased this year for the moment from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The external debt of the state has increased this year so far from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
State debt called negotiable reached at the end of September 803.3 billion crowns and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average maturity of the State debt amounted to 6.5 years.
&quot;Total debt has increased year-on-year from the first to the third quartal by 13 percent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, far too high a figure.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by annuity securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other side it indicates that there will be something to negotiate when the pension reform comes,” commented the Pikora data.
Better than expected
It follows from the State debt financing and management strategy for 2007 that the government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to better-than-expected progress in state budget savings, the ministry reduced the planned sum to 152.8 billion crowns.
The sum is essentially made up of the state budget deficit which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the 91.3 billion crowns initially forecast.
Then there are the maximum sources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely 13.3 billion crowns, the reserve of 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of state annuity securities for 43 billion crowns and repayments of European Investment Bank loans amounting to 1.8 billion crowns.
She was today appearing in court in Khartoum for naming a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday evening by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and expulsion, her lawyer said.
The Briton was accused of having let 6 to 7 year old students give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illicit.
She was liable to a whipping sentence.
The 54-year-old British teacher at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with undermining Islam and sedition under article 125 of the Sudanese penal code. following several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually dates back to September, when this teacher asked her students, aged 6/7, to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
&quot;Eight names come out of the children&#39;s mouths, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,&quot; says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 children out of 23 chose Mohamed as their favorite first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the photo of the bear followed by the caption “My name is Mohamed”.
The bear itself had no label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the depiction of the prophet being considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons&#39; Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, clarified that he knew her well and that she would never do anything that would be insulting to a religious faith, &quot;I I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name&quot;, it is only an &quot;innocent mistake&quot;.
Opinion shared by many pupils of the teacher who describe her as &quot;very attentive towards her pupils&quot; and &quot;who never speaks of religion in class&quot;.
Remember that the first name Mohamed is also the most popular middle name in Great Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This first name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can we for example give it to a toy?
This is of course a matter of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday during the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Albanians of Kosovo completed Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final session of discussions without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
&quot;It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status&quot;, declared the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, during a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was &quot;at stake&quot;, his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
&quot;We do not foresee violence in the immediate future but we are entering a very difficult period&quot;, he added, noting that &quot;obvious tensions exist&quot;.
End of mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go one last time on Monday to Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the 90% Albanian-populated province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final round of talks since the troika was commissioned to mediate again by the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, Westerners believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina says it is ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
“Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached,” announced the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel in Baden where these “last chance negotiations” had been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovar rebellion and future prime minister of the province, expressed his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade “belonged to a past which led to murders and deportations”.
&quot;Domino effect&quot;
Serbian President Boris Tadic considered for his part that a compromise was still possible, warning the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province&#39;s independence.
Belgrade says in particular it fears a &quot;domino effect&quot; in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
“For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should be taken exclusively by the Security Council, where its Russian ally has the right of veto.
“The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word”
“Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia,” said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
“These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.”
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that &quot;the Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the status&quot;, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanians would be made &quot;in consultation&quot; with the West.
Bush strikes an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference convened by him on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and the Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately start negotiations with a view to finding a final settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a &quot;peace treaty&quot; before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must dismantle &quot;terrorist infrastructure&quot; and Israel must end its settlement activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations under the &quot;road map&quot; for peace they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority presided over by Abbas would aim &quot;to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including the central issues&quot;.
This designation covers the three thorny issues at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is today the State of Israel. during the conflict of 1948.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations should be &quot;comprehensive and thorough&quot; and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing &quot;Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water , security, among others&quot;.
Rising in his turn to the podium, Olmert pledged that the forthcoming talks would be &quot;direct and continuous&quot; and to make &quot;an effort to complete them during the course of 2008&quot;.
Bush has set the end of 2008 as the deadline for implementing his &quot;vision of two coexisting Palestinian and Israeli states&quot;.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it obtained a commitment to do so from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the origin of a plan, endorsed by all the Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks &quot;a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects&quot;, estimates Prince Saud in his interview with the Arabic-language daily with Saudi capital.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always in this type of news item, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation by the General Inspectorate of the National Police (IGPN), a police car was driving on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
“She was not in intervention but on patrol, and was traveling at 40-50 km / h, without flashing lights”, explains a police source.
A green motorcycle from the Kawazaki brand, &quot;not homologated, therefore not authorized to circulate on public roads&quot; (read below) and piloted by two young people without helmets, was traveling &quot;at very high speed&quot;.
&quot;She hit the police car on her left, after refusing priority on the right,&quot; said a police officer.
The blood alcohol test carried out on the occupants of the vehicle proved negative.
The condition of the car (smashed front, starry windshield, torn bumper) testifies to the violence of the impact.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the public prosecutor of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation for “acts of involuntary homicide and non-assistance to person in danger” to the IGPN, cosaisie with the Val-d&#39;Oise Departmental Directorate of Public Security.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor clarified that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, heard on Sunday evening, confirmed &quot;the version of the police, namely that this mini-motorcycle arrived relatively quickly on their left&quot;.
Yesterday, a kind of groove, probably caused by the friction of the toe clips on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained tangled until the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles were seized and will be the subject of a technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have very quickly left the scene, thus not lending help to the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out “any serious fault” concerning this point.
&quot;This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation, on which we must be very careful,&quot; said a police source.
Release met an eyewitness to those few moments following the accident.
One of its windows overlooking the stage.
“We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to revive them, says this witness.
There was nothing to do&quot;.
He then saw “a completely haggard, limping policeman.
Two others were trying to resuscitate one of the young people, the fourth was talking on the phone”.
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, with the certainty that those present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers were taken away by car by colleagues who arrived on the scene. .
Still according to this witness, help arrived “about twenty minutes after the departure of the police”.
They also practiced cardiac massages, in vain.
“I will not let it be said that the police services did not provide assistance to the young people.
These young people were rescued.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save them,” said the prosecutor.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday cracked down on the first protests since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, around 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against state of emergency measures were injured by tear gas canisters used by security forces, according to reports. witnesses.
The latter responded by throwing stones, injuring the police.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and injured lawyers.
Several were reportedly arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers at the Supreme Court Bar have called for a general strike and announced protests, following a spate of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists Man and Lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other protests reportedly took place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (north-west).
The lawyers&#39; movement gathered support on Monday from religious parties grouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president &#39;&#39;urged the population to send flowers to the judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and rubbish to those who took the oath before Musharraf&#39;&#39;.
&#39;&#39;Musharraf&#39;s promise no longer holds&#39;&#39;
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly targeted by the exceptional measure proclaimed on Saturday evening.
She was to decide in the coming days on the legality of the presidential re-election, on October 6, by indirect suffrage, of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was ousted and replaced.
&#39;&#39;Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to Supreme Court rulings,&#39;&#39; the magistrate told The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf&#39;s promise to leave the army and become a civilian president &#39;&#39;no longer holds&#39;&#39; after the imposition of a state of emergency, deputy information minister Tariq said on Monday. Azem.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, the end of his first presidential term.
The deputy information minister also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
Meanwhile, the Pakistani government has denied persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf has been under house arrest by his deputy army chief.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one in three pregnancies (36%) is unplanned, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (INED), forty years after the passage of the Neuwirth law which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected births.
The various methods of contraception such as the pill or the IUD still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates INED.
The liberalization of contraception has all the same allowed better &quot;fertility control&quot;, according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births out of ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated to the nearest month for one in five couples and if possible in the spring, the season considered to be the most pleasant for having a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It took more than seven hours of work in space for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates on the International Space Station (ISS) to carry out the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, essential for the continuation scientific activities of the station.
A risky outing that has accumulated records because of its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, the tools &quot;tinkered&quot; by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when the astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part responsible for soon hosting the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a sort of dock for the laboratory modules.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a module for the production of electricity by solar panels weighing 17.5 tonnes, already present on the ISS, in order to place it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began redeploying the module&#39;s solar panels, which have a span of 76 meters.
And that&#39;s where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, was damaged for almost a meter by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment was halted so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally to carry out a control exit from the shuttle Discovery, then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, saw themselves forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to prance after the 30-meter length of the remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to carry out the repair.
It is one of NASA&#39;s best spacewalkers.
Tall, resistant, very skilful, he has a very developed torso and long arms.
At 46, this doctor by training was therefore responsible for “operating” on the “wounded” solar panel.
After carefully inspecting the damage, he cut the faulty cable and installed some kind of “splints” on the damaged area.
He was helped by a second &quot;spacewalker&quot; who remained near the airlock and, from inside, by the other astronauts, including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped in insulation to prevent electrocution on the solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and &quot;tinkered&quot; by the astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was over, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before taking inventory of his tools and heading back inside the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
EADS stock sanctioned on the stock exchange
EADS shares are currently in sharp decline on the Paris stock exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros currently on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to revise its operating profit forecast for 2007 following the delays caused by the slow progress of the development of the engine of the A400M, which conditions the maiden flight of the plane.
The cost to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport plane, announced in October, amounts to &quot;between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, including more than 1 billion for Airbus&quot;, has announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Because of these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating profit (EBIT) targets for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he adds without further details.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS&#39; operating profit fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to charges related to delays in another program, that of the very jumbo A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspense, Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians will massively opt for the party of President Putin, united Russia.
Confirming their aspiration to stability, even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days before the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is today sending voters a televised message on public channels, already recorded but the content of which is kept secret.
He does so as head of the list of United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory promises to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not let anything show through when he received the foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
&quot;We know the price of real democracy and want honest, most transparent and open elections, elections without a hitch,&quot; he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from the mark.
She denounces a campaign tainted with pressure.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says there have &quot;never been such dirty elections, even during Yeltsin&#39;s time&quot;.
After the repression of the demonstrations last weekend, the former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, remains banned from visiting according to his lawyer.
&quot;The Russians have kept the mentality of homo sovieticus&quot;
Behind these legislative elections without suspense loom two much more open questions:
- Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official journal published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
But no successor emerges.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
Be that as it may, in the legislative and presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It&#39;s a tradition.
&quot;The Russians have kept the mentality of homo sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their destiny&quot;, estimates the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, of the State University of Saint Petersburg, goes back further: civil society fell behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit retarded the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 90s, &quot;Putin returned to the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease. », Considers Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians are “voluntarily renouncing the personal responsibility” which they briefly demonstrated after the break-up of the USSR.
&quot;What&#39;s the use of thinking?&quot;
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) lead the local lists of United Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 90s.
Public opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: “What is the point of thinking?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them? »
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Bad Arolsen Nazi archives, which trace the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are freely accessible.
The 47 million archival documents, stored over 27 km of linear space in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), have so far only been available for consultation for &quot;humanitarian&quot; purposes, i.e. individually and by name. at the request of a former victim or his heirs.
The eleven States in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all the States being completed, the opening is effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Historians&#39; access to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to carry out research &quot;in particular on the movements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of the forced laborers&quot;, explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, opposed the opening of these nominative documents to the public, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the supposed homosexuality or the mental handicap of certain victims of the deportation.
The registers of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find the civilians deported or subjected to compulsory labor and, possibly, to bring them proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität Berlin, in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches nearly 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India&#39;s largest trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, have indicated.
EU foreign ministers last April gave the green light to the European Commission to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association Southeast Asian nations (Asean). Bilateral Indo-European trade already reaches nearly 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India&#39;s largest trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its largest foreign investor, but India is only the EU&#39;s ninth largest trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
&quot;A free trade pact will boost the two economies enormously&quot; and &quot;India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans&quot;, justified Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, specified the European commissioner. The Asian and European giants exchange annually for “47 billion euros of goods” and for “ten billion euros in services,&quot; Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, said this week, regretting that bilateral trade has &quot;not yet reached its potential&quot;. meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England acknowledges concerns by offering £10bn over five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday said it was keen to alleviate the current resurgence of concerns over credit conditions, and announced a ten billion pound offer at a base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
“To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned supply of reserves during the maintenance period beginning on December 6 in the form of a five-week open market operation,” it said in a statement.
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will thus be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
This is believed to be the first time the BoE has released five-week liquidity in an open market operation.
These are normally done in a week.
The BoE adds in its press release that it “stands ready to take further measures to keep the rates” of overnight interbank loans in line with its base rate.
The overnight interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate stood at 6.6%, its highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis of the summer, the sums placed on the market by the Bank of England were accompanied by a high penalty rate which had dissuaded the banks from having recourse to them.
According to certain rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the course of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums placed on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Center groups refused Thursday to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Registered in a socialist &quot;niche&quot; (session at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted Tuesday by the national office of the PS among which the increase of 50% of the premium for employment, the reinstatement of the floating TIPP, a transport check or rent control.
UMP and NC having voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was adjourned at the end of the general discussion which gave rise to exchanges, sometimes lively, between the majority and the opposition a few hours from Nicolas Sarkozy&#39;s televised intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS deputies Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent all of its proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors about C3 Presents creating a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with UK producer Melvin Benn&#39;s Festival Republic.
&quot;For our company, it&#39;s an honor to work with someone who has, no more, no less, inspired the current festival movement in America,&quot; C3&#39;s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces Chicago&#39;s Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey is a summer destination for camping.
The festival is scheduled to be held Aug. 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Once known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the world&#39;s most respected festival producers.
In 1989 he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and then in 2006 Festival Republic established the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also taken care of the production, licensing and organizational duties of the Glastonbury Festival, which now seats up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury &quot;the most inspiring event&quot; he has ever attended, C3&#39;s Charlie Jones says his company and that of Melvin Benn are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
&quot;We chose Philadelphia as the market and worked diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,&quot; says Charlie Jones.
“We were in discussions with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
Unfortunately, we got bogged down in politics by the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to speak with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a superb festival on an exceptional site which, ultimately, will serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Chicago&#39;s Grant Park, after breaking the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events recorded respective gross receipts of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
Both of these festivals are held in urban settings.
“Melvin Benn&#39;s European model is a country festival, while ours take place more in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The objective is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give the impression of both a European-style rural festival and an American-style urban one.
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the conditions of the agreement, but affirms that they are sufficiently interesting to make it possible to invest in such an event and to host a festival which, hopefully, will have a long life.
Charlie Jones says the festival&#39;s capacity is &quot;very large&quot;, similar to that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations have been extended to the bands, but nothing could be confirmed as of press time.
&quot;Vineland will be rock-flavored, but the music will be varied, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers,&quot; says Charlie Jones.
His partners in C3, which received the Top Independent Promoter award at the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It&#39;s not easy to attract Hollywood film sets to Montreal when none other than Terminator is against it...
This mission of seduction is part of the functions of a delegate.
A mandate - &quot;politically difficult&quot; because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces &quot;runaway productions&quot;.
Is it difficult to play in the legs of the &quot;Governator&quot;?
“You have to be careful, it&#39;s the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those that they will judge the best,” he said.
Festival race
For the moment, however, Denis Turcotte&#39;s priority is the promotion of local cinema.
The race for the Oscars has begun.
He will be at all the festivals on the West Coast, whether it&#39;s Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, to present Quebec films, highlight them and ensure that the directors do interviews. .
The Dark Ages had a great showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on view in Santa Monica and will premiere at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four features and four shorts at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally in the stock market? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks from the end of the financial year, investors are already rubbing their hands hoping for the arrival of the traditional end-of-year rally.
However, this year experts are not so sure that will happen.
Banif believes that &quot;from a statistical point of view, the month of December in the stock market generally has a positive behavior.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts exclusively based on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainties await in the markets, at least in the short term&quot;.
Although they are not in favor of the stock market gaining momentum during the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that &quot;the stock market thrives on the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the flight effect towards quality values in both long and short periods&quot;.
For this, they believe that the stock market will have a rather sideways behavior, not exempt from volatilities &quot;especially because we do not know the impact of the probable cut in the rates of the Fed, given the high level of crude and the danger stimulation of inflationary pressures&quot;
Javier Barrio, BPI&#39;s sales manager in Spain, agrees that now is not the right time to say there will be a rally.
&quot;It&#39;s not the best thing,&quot; says the expert.
The Ibex, the Spanish stock market index, has lost almost 4% since November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to the pension schemes that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be a little different this year since he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the Constitution Day weekend (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that the volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst of Inversis Banco, evaluates that we are close to the technical levels and &quot;that is why we could observe a rebound of the index which could be provoked according to the information that arrives from the Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market&quot;.
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading the Ibex to new maximum odds.
Intermoney&#39;s Solana says &quot;this year the big values are back for him&quot;.
The expert would include in the portfolio the two big banks and some builders &quot;because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive&quot;.
While, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco ensures that the increases will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
Manufacturers will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they get started.
&quot;ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other manufacturers such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path&quot;, explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
In the past seven years, only twice has December been a bearish month.
The real end-of-year rally took place in 2003, when stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the bursting of the technology bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, the month of December registered an increase of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the moment the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it succeeds in computing its end-of-year rally.
Banque Populaire will open 200 offices open 12 noon from Monday to Saturday
Banque Populaire has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 are the banks located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish agencies, since it was the first group that decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 p.m., and to open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
Another group which has also reiterated several times that it would like to increase the hours of its branches, BBVA, even if it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is close to reaching an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its branches on Saturdays instead of opening one afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of the Banque Populaire will be decisive for other organizations to adhere or not to this initiative which coincides with business hours.
It is precisely this objective that the Banque Populaire seeks.
Attract autonomous customers who circulate in these areas to shop in SMEs and businesses on the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 branches located throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not a question of opening new branches but of renovating existing ones.
For this, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the hours is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The commercial manager of the bank, Ángel Rivera, assures that this renovation does not imply large investments, but the hiring of personnel, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per branch.
The branches, which will also have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Banque Populaire has already tested its initiative in three branches in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, as Ángel Rivero explains.
The Murillo Brave, O&#39;Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid branches are the streets to have been chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
Banque Populaire currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others that operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very wide opening hours, which also open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the model of the BBVA, where many of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for its sale.
“We don&#39;t want to compete with our customers,” notes Rivero.
For the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with personnel from outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the stock market value of its rival Antena 3
We got there.
With this sentence Paolo Vasile, a delegated adviser of Telecinco, yesterday expressed his satisfaction, at the close of the stock market, when he found that the channel he leads doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
A single aspect tarnished his joy: &#39;what hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more but that we have decreased less&#39;, he affirmed.
However, he emphasized that in a weak market &#39;we fell less&#39;.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain stabilizes its loss at 15.66% for a year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reached 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which yielded 1.52% yesterday and which has accumulated a drop of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of other communication companies listed on the stock exchange amounts to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in that of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million in that of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is due to the fact that &#39;we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience&#39;.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year the first television channel to surpass 1,000 million in gross advertising revenue, as assured Giuseppe Tringali, the delegated adviser of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages advertising of the group.
For this announced data to be real, the television channel should register for the current financial year an increase of 3.6% in its billing for advertising compared to the 965.4 million for the 2006 financial year.
For its part, Antenne 3&#39;s net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the financial year (to reach 734.4 million) while net television revenues increased by 0 .7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the better relative evolution of Telecinco on the stock market is the important payout that it has maintained until now: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit between its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
&#39;We have the official commitment to give a minimum of 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make happy our shareholders, those to whom we have already given titles with the 33% of Endemol&#39;.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently cut its profit estimates for Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decline in projected revenue growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This same company reduced the earnings forecast for Antenne 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

The Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on November 1
Parallel to its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of the Congress of the amendments incorporated into the project in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the year ends.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the effort made by the deputies and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations capable of guaranteeing the protection of investors and regulating in detail the activity of the organizations so that the markets operate efficiently.
The Mifid, which modifies the Securities Market Law, involves the modernization of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting the cooperation between the different leaders of the European Union.
The new regulations will make it possible to provide financial advisory services both to specialized companies and to natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFI), which merge with companies companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of operations on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add to the regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems, which face competition to the current stock market managers.
The Law also obliges investment services companies to disclose to the market information on key aspects of its business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and obliges them to keep a register of all the operations they carry out, to facilitate control by the CNMV.
Going through the Congressional Economics Committee, several changes were added, including one that highlights that secured debt will be considered a &quot;complex&quot; financial instrument given its high risk for the investor, who demonstrated with what happened with US high-risk (subprime) mortgage debt.
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of the direction took advantage to legally delimit the functions that the graduates in Economics can have 30 years after that in 1977, was approved, the royal decree that delimits the professional functions reserved to the economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to provide marketing products and attracting new clients to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonized consumer price index increases by five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an assessment of the evolution of prices in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by offering data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The leading indicator is calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modeling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication. .
INE recalled that the information provided by the leading indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily have to coincide with the definitive data which will be revealed on December 14th.
&quot;The CPI will continue at relatively high levels&quot;
Second Vice President and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes claimed that November&#39;s 4.1% CPI increase is a &quot;temporal figure&quot;, but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue at &quot;relatively high&quot; levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes clarified in the corridors of Congress that &quot;although the figure is not good&quot; Spain&#39;s inflation differential regarding the monetary union continues to be &quot;more or less&quot; the same than in recent years.
He also explained that in November &quot;there were fewer surprises&quot; than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
“We were hoping for a figure around 4%,” admitted the Minister of the Economy in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros over three years
Northern Rock&#39;s deposits have fallen more than 50% to 12,000 million pounds (16,800 million euros) since it entered into crisis in the middle of September and had to resort to a credit of emergence with the Bank of England.
At that time he was amassing some record deposits above 25,000 million pounds, a figure which has gradually fallen in two and a half months due to the mistrust of his customers and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the Government has offered and which it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rebrand the body with its Virgin Money financial brand, needs to grab around a quarter of UK bank revenue that will be deposited over the next three years to get that remaining £18 trillion until it reaches the objective of 30,000 million.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for its garish advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Association&#39;s bid, involving three other companies, including its favorite, to save it from bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for a plot of alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested early today the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) because of his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption discovered this week.
In addition, one of the city council secretaries and the city police chief were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May Juan Morales, current right-wing deputy, and until then municipal councilor of the town hall, and who according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Channel, could be the &#39;leader&#39; of this frame.
The agents continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Town Planning Council and we do not rule out the possibility of new stops in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, main suspect of the plot of urban corruption, discovered at the beginning of this week, has been imputed.
As the Channel SER reported yesterday to the lawyer of the &#39;popular party&#39; deputy Juan Morales, he was arrested on leaving Morales&#39; home with important documentation in his possession relating to the plot.
In addition, according to sources in the investigation, the object of the investigation is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a construction company in Galicia to requalify 200 hectares of ground.
At the moment, there are eight people detained.
Bono agrees to lead Spain&#39;s Socialist Party bid for Toledo and chair Congress if they win the election
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general election.
Thus the secretary of organization of the Spanish socialist party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting which took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive justified the offer made to the ex-minister because &quot;it is important to count on the best&quot; in political life and Bono &quot;is among the best&quot;.
Moreover, he pointed out that &quot;yes it seems&quot; that the politician from La Manche will be the candidate of the socialist group that will chair the Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, which on November 15 made public his decision not to stand in the next general elections and to give up his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change within the framework university.
The ex-minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned him two years ago.
Moreover, he pointed out that, even if the citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish socialist party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce who will be president of the Congress, in an &quot;act of transparency&quot;.
If he achieves the post, Bono hopes to transform the House into &quot;a house of respect and not of insult or shouting&quot; and make it &quot;more and more like the citizens&quot;.
&quot;Sometimes it seems lamentably that the only place in Madrid where you can&#39;t talk quietly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times&quot;.
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and &quot;his know-how&quot; and he did not want to act as if he already held his position so as not to fall, as he did. remarked, in what his opponents might consider &quot;dominance&quot;.
climate propaganda
As the climate change movement ruthlessly persecutes both skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron-clad consistency.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement who is President of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a &quot;new contract for the planet&quot;. .
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or the inaction, of his Government contributed in a decisive way to Spain being at the head of the European Union in the non-execution of the protocols of Kyoto.
Who are responsible for the non-execution, in which sectors did it occur and why his Government, that of the contract with the planet, did not avoid it.
In addition, he must clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures he is going to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be affected, which citizens&#39; habits will have to be changed, which individual and collective energy savings will we be forced to make, which economic consequences will this cause?
That is, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there have been and there will be no explanations.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to corporate and individual accounts.
Until the hundredth of the gasoline suggested by the Spanish socialist party seemed to him electoralmente so dangerous to Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
That is to say that it is a question of saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With sentences that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for the electoral campaigns who does not speak, who does not denounce and who does not demand, embellishes the meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that it is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting party and that does not pretend that we move by bicycle or refresh ourselves with the fan.
Mayor and local police chief of Totana arrested for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Spanish Gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian locality of Totana, the &quot;popular&quot; José Martínez Andreo, the local police chief, the secretary of the Town Hall and a hotel entrepreneur suspected of possible urban crimes, informed today survey sources.
The municipal councilor was arrested at his home and taken to the Town Hall, where many agents have gathered at this time, who have also presented themselves for the office of municipal councilor for town planning and for the municipal industrial soil and housing management company.
These three stops are added to the six stops made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 homes, after paying illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people were not arrested but they are charged in the judicial investigation, which the Court number 1 of Totana instructed.
The first six detainees passed today to a judicial disposition.
According to the sources, the former municipal councilor of Totana and currently autonomous parliamentarian of the PP party, Juan Morales, is under investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was imputed, as well as the current fiancée of the former councilor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur from Vigo (Galicia) Manuel NA, were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), together with Pablo José MG, director of Suelo de Inmonuar, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the bribes were allegedly made.
The investigation is the responsibility of the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operative Unit (UCO) of the Gendarmerie whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies linked to the detainees and located in Madrid , in Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was therefore arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a very well-known poultry products company in the region, who could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with &quot;spa&quot;.
The company has acquired 2.2 million square meters of land from Totana which have been requalified and its project would suppose doubling the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is made up of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with real estate development; Conycase, which manages the Vigo car parks in Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza de Fernando el Católico streets; Hogartel, which handles direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

A colleague passes on the information on the introduction in the Penal Code of offenses on Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a misdemeanor punishable by six months to a year.
On the other hand, the theft in a store of cds for a value lower than 400 euros, is considered only as a fault (article 623.1).
B. Theft in a store for a value up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than that imposed for downloading (an article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the trafficking of compact discs.
Participating in a tumultuous fight carries a penalty of three months to one year (article 154 of the Penal Code) and trafficking in cds would carry a penalty of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without the authorization of the authors is punished more than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186).

My GP told me about one of his articles on strange research titled: &#39;Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less&#39;.
That is to say, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of the workers depends on what the colleagues earn.
The study was carried out using magnetic resonance tomography at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, study author and head of the neurocognition imaging group at the Life&amp;Brain Institute, Germany: &quot;The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed.&quot;
The researchers observed that when both people guessed that they were receiving the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received double the activation was greater.
I don&#39;t know if this conclusion required so much science.
Balkan Prosecutor
Carla del Ponte for eight years has relentlessly pursued Balkan war criminals from the prosecution of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague.
Her mandate ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bitter taste, because those mainly responsible for the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died - ex-general Ratko Mladic and the ex-Serbobosnio leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are in this list from which the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach&#39;s documentary takes its title, &#39;Carla&#39;s List&#39; (2006, not screened exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a detective thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York who pursues fugitive criminals and pressures the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What insurance is right for me?
Motor insurance, which covers the driver against possible claims, involves a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or the use to which it is put, among other things.
Having a car is the main thing.
Y es que, escoger el seguro de automóvil adecuado es incluso más difícil que elegir el modelo de vehículo.
And it is that, to choose the adequate automobile insurance, is even more difficult than to choose the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the driving license, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or the use we make of it, among other things.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the higher the probability of suffering an accident, the higher the odds to be paid.
It is for this reason that people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these people have a lower loss rate due to their caution.
Similarly, using censuses, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer crashes than single drivers.
The use made of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and therefore the probability of having an accident.
By increasing the frequency the probabilities increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the price of the premium.
This is why the driver must carefully study the situation to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
Here we will expose the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers him a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face various disadvantages when signing a contract with insurance at an affordable price, such as low driving experience and the age of the driving licence.
Although the ideal way to be well insured is all-risk insurance, other more economical options exist.
The most far-sighted drivers can opt for all-risk insurance with deductible, so that they obtain the coverage of all-risk insurance but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the claim.
&quot;The part of the amount of the claim that the customer pays will be established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount will be&quot;, specifies Luis Noguera, the manager in Spain of First Europa, online insurance mediator. .
Another option is extended third party insurance, whereby the customer provides protection against damage caused to third parties, but not for damage caused to his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
An advice.
If you are under 25, try to be careful and avoid claims as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, which may reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction of the base rate that the company has.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic rate.
&quot;The bonuses and sanctions will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses&quot;, clarifies Noguera.
Beyond the age of 25, it becomes easier for drivers when signing a contract with insurance, since the loss rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
It is for this reason that it is preferable to choose all-risk insurance with a deductible.
&quot;Normally young people cannot take advantage of the experience previously acquired after an accident&quot;, assures the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once passed the &#39; fear of the novice&#39;.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is preferable that he negotiates comprehensive insurance, as long as his economic situation allows him to do so.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be the people with the lowest loss ratio, because the increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be all-risk insurance with deductible (which may be 300 euros), or extended third-party insurance from the third year of the vehicle&#39;s life when the insured has a high level of bonus. .
&quot;They have a more relaxed conduct and they have greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury of assuming a greater quantity of franchises&quot;, judge Luis Noguera.
For retirees, all-risk insurance with deductible is preferable (being this of 150 euros), or extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver against possible claims, but also because it represents a major expense, which is why it It is fundamental to properly study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
Celtic will be looking to earn a point from Milan to reach the knockout stages
AC Milan and Celtic Glasgow face off next Tuesday at the San Siro in search of the point they need to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the Champions League, since it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to to classify.
The Italians have ten points and have already qualified on matchday five with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow have nine points, but they still need another point to ensure Shakhtar Donetsk , which has six, and which receives Benfica which has four, does not pass in front of him.
These two Group D games will be played a week before Matchday 6 ends, as AC Milan are due to play the Club World Cup semi-finals in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place in the final. of December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before a draw at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most expected result, although both teams will try to emerge victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow know that in winning he would remain first and ensure a better crossing in the round of 16.
A defeat for Gordon Strachan&#39;s team could be enough to qualify if Shakhtar Donetsk do not win, but they will not be able to count on that alone since with nine points the game goes to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening with the Scots, who have good hopes of qualifying for the round of 16 for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten in the last edition by a goal from Kaka during extra time (1-0).
While waiting for the victory of the &#39;rossoneri&#39; the triumph would only go to Shakhtar, in the event that Celtic lost, to qualify for the round of 16 to be able to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that Benfica, despite being last and without possibilities of continuing the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls initiated in Vancouver (Canada), in front of around 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group disbanded in 2000.
&#39;Posh Spice&#39; (Victoria Beckham), &#39;Scary Spice&#39; (Melanie Brown), &#39;Baby Spice&#39; (Emma Bunton), &#39;Sporty Spice&#39; (Melanie Chisholm) and &#39;Ginger Spice&#39; (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before to begin their concert at Vancouver&#39;s GM Place stadium that the band&#39;s reunion is &quot;brilliant&quot;.
Around 20,000 people sold out the tickets to attend the concert which was the subject of a video in which the story of the band that caused a stir in the late 1990s is told.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album which includes their main successes as well as two new songs, &#39;Headlines&#39; and &#39;Voodoo&#39;, which EMI releases in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls took to the stage showing off bracelets given to them by &#39;Posh Spice&#39; husband, British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was in the public who filled the GM Place, even if Victoria had forbidden him a few days before.
Before the show started, Victoria Beckham remarked that the British footballer &quot;hasn&#39;t seen our costumes so I&#39;m nervous because I don&#39;t know what he&#39;s going to think of the show&quot;.
&#39;Sporty Spice&#39;, who left the band in 1998 &#39;because of the differences between us&#39; and caused the band to break up two years later, also expressed nervousness during a press interview two hours before the start of the show .
&quot;I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of people changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I&#39;m glad I made a decision,&quot; Chisholm said of reuniting with the group she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also remarked that over time, &quot;things have settled down and we like each other a lot&quot;.
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
To begin, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of babysitters was waiting for them.
They have five seven sons.
After the concert in Vancouver, the group will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid they will be exhibited on December 23rd.
The new gas deal between Russia and Ukraine raises the alarm.
A dispute over the price of gas is brewing between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk of repercussions on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are transported by gas pipelines, and each conduit is scrupulously monitored.
kyiv has announced that if Russia raises the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two caused a decrease in supplies to EU countries
The latest spat between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia&#39;s owned monopoly company supplying the gas, tried unsuccessfully to reach an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom said it would increase its prices to Ukraine as planned after it agreed to pay for 2008 up to 50% more for gas supplies from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said this would mean a 40% increase in import costs for Ukraine from Gazprom.
“It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, remembering that we are a country through which most of the gas passes,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told the news agency. Reuters.
“The fluctuations in gas costs would no doubt be linked to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine”
The last major altercation between Moscow and kyiv in January 2006 caused the interruption of supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine.
This caused exports to Western Europe to fall, thereby increasing prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of EU supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
Consequently, Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Union nations in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health &#39;must control its foreign employees&#39;.
The Scottish Department of Health must improve the checks to be carried out on its non-EU employees to check whether they have criminal precedents, the control committee has said.
The warning from the Auditor General, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was implicated in the Glasgow airport attack in June.
Mr Black further expressed concern that the Scottish Department of Health has no accurate data on the number of overseas people it employs.
His report nevertheless highlighted other decisive checks, correctly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The auditor general carried out checks on non-EU staff following the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28, an Iraqi-born doctor working at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after crashing his jeep into the gates of the main terminal.
He was one of three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October on suspicion of being involved in various attempted car bombings around the UK.
The Department of Health will need to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff to ensure that their qualifications, experience and work permits are valid for the UK.
Although the Scottish Department of Health uses Scottish Disclosure to carry out criminal precedent checks, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside of Great Britain.
Among many caveats, the Auditor General&#39;s report now states that committees are required to confront the Bureau of Criminal Precedents Review, thus allowing employers to undertake reviews of various countries.
“While we found that some personnel information has been verified, this is not done every time. announces the report.
Mr Black said the Scottish Department of Health carries out most of the pre-employment checks that it would do itself, but he also added: &quot;Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on certain overseas personnel is available to medical services.
Mr Peter Terry, chairman of BMA Scotland, said it was &quot;extremely unlikely&quot; that pre-employment checks could identify employees who might commit future terrorist acts.
He said &quot;the report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently being carried out are working well across the Scottish healthcare system and it is uncertain whether these warnings can add any value.&quot;
Scottish health authorities said they employed 1,161 people overseas, most of whom were doctors and nurses.
But the Auditor General stressed that these figures must certainly be revised upwards, in part because of problems relating to the identification of staff members on permanent contracts, who may or may not choose to remain in our country. .
The investigation has shown that the current health authority check procedures in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian are fully adequate.
These checks are carried out on passport, work permit and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and system of pre-employment checks for overseas health service staff.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: &#39;I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.
She added that the Scottish Government allied with the Health Committees would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report due to be published next month, and would commit to ensuring better enforcement of the recently updated pre-employment checks for all. employees, including overseas people.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the biopic about late Joy Division frontman Ian Curts, scooped 5 awards, including best picture, at the British Independent Film Oscars.
The trophies also went to star Sam Riley, who worked in a shop until he was cast as Curtis in the film, which is directed by Anton Corbijn and co-starred Toby Kebbell.
Madame Judi Dench was named best actress for her role in the thriller &quot;Notes sur Un Scandale&quot;
Bond star Daniel Craig picked up the Variety Award for bringing the British film to the international spotlight.
The prizes were distributed during the ceremony at London&#39;s Round house.
Control chronicles Curtis&#39; rise to success with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, aged 23.
The black and white film, whose musical score was directed by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot on a budget of barely 3 million Sterling.
But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of U2&#39;s Joshua Tree album, won two awards, the first as Best Director and the second as Best Newbie Director.
Le Rock was also rewarded with the prize for Best Documentary awarded to the film by Julien Temple on the singer of the Clash, Joe Strummer.
The Best Actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his portrayal of the driver of a Russian mob boss, in the London-based thriller directed by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone renowned for his tough character portrayals, won the Richard Harris Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Film.
The 50-year-old director, having shot films like Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named in honor of star Harris, protagonist of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney made it possible for people like me to have access to the cinema,” he declared.
“I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice. »
&quot;I was in awe of this great current actor, I was extremely honored&quot;
The independent film Oscars, better known as “the Bifas” are awarded by a jury made up of directors, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa fans and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom
Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it had arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells planning an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on clerics and the armed forces.
State television of the world&#39;s largest oil exporter said that one of the cells of missile smugglers.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have staged a campaign against the US-allied monarchy since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in Province Orientale, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly assembled a group of 35,000 soldiers to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper, citing a statement by the interior minister, said 18 of those arrested belong to a cell headed by a &quot;missile launching expert&quot; who infiltrated the country.
The militants are said to have been planning to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
22 people among the detainees appear to have plotted the assassination of clerics and armed forces.
Government urged clerics to do more against Saudis headed to Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting against Allied Forces and against the US-allied Shiite Muslim government, considered heretical by Saudi hardliners Sunny.
Al Qaeda militants believe that in Saudi Arabia many clerics have collaborated with the authorities to support the policies of the royal family which dominates the government.
Militants, encouraged by calls against the pro-Western Saudi government by Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Significant efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five months,” the interior minister&#39;s spokesperson told state television.
Among the detainees are 16 members of Medina organized into a &quot;media cell&quot; aimed at promoting &quot;takfiri thought&quot;, the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals which supports the use of violence against infidel and apostate Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 people are accused of having subsidized the militants.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus has certainly been a nice planet to live in.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit has shown that the planet is certainly half the size of Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are nearly the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus may have had Earth-like conditions, and may even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation allied to a slower rotation led Venus towards a whole different kind of evolution.
Today the planet is starved of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms, and has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.
The findings of Venus Express, the European Space Agency&#39;s probe, which studied the planet for a year, offer a grim vision of Earth&#39;s potential future due to catastrophic changes in climate.
Professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: &quot;We are beginning to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of the Earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
“Our new data allow us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago Venus would have originally been identical to Earth, perhaps even with a habitable surface. »
Enriched uranium sequestered by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer said three people have been arrested and the material is being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was indeed uranium, but revealed that the goods would be worth $1 million (£480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he was not up to the task as a presidential candidate, to answer a snowman&#39;s questions.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who have recorded their questions submit them to the candidates.
On Wednesday night, November 28, none of the questions posed were as ridiculous as the one that came out of another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked the Democrats where they stand on global warming.
But this time around, the questions and answers very much reflected the conditions of the Republican Party, a candidate in the upcoming elections.
We do not know on what criteria, the producers of CNN, which sponsored the debate, chose the You Tube clips to show to the aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest dealing with a single theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strongest subjects for the Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard pleasant things: The board noted increases in approval when candidates spoke rudely.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney who is leading the important early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his term as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of employing illegal immigrants in his home.
Both fighters became particularly fierce when asked if they would be willing to promote &quot;amnesia&quot; (offering illegals regular status and the chance to become citizens).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a congressman from California, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, have successfully delved into this topic.
Neither of them has the possibility of being elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps thanks to the fact that they began to fight immigration earlier and more incisively than the others.
In general, the candidates, at least regarding immigration, have the same opinions: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, combined with the concerns aroused in particular by the affair of the toxic toys made in China, or many other fears towards the outside world, favor the Republicans to forget, or to minimize the divisions between the libertarians and the Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly awkward when other topics were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the campaign for gun control.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether watering your nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked if the candidates believed in its totality, in the content of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare to declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even if he is not sure to believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked if Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
We did not expect to see Mike Huckabee, - in pole position in Iowa during a recent election, thanks to his longtime Christian conservatism - declaring that the death penalty is painful although necessary.
When pressed on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus is too posh to run for office.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee&#39;s rise in Iowa coincides with recent prodigious grant research by libertarian Ron Paul, and whistles during Wednesday&#39;s debate.
These two have emerged from nothing, thanks to the fact that the two proteges of the party cannot agree on who is the more famous and more traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party early and convincingly with a message of success about American greatness bringing the leaders together.
This time the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
Labor pains
Gordon Brown has discovered a new hole to sink into; Even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, this one isn&#39;t particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no extra marital toe sucked.
But now a revelation attests that a rich businessman would have hidden for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labor Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), that the party n would not have declared: A new battle which Gordon Brown would have done well without.
Two months ago the Prime Minister backtracked on his election plan, stupidly insulting British intelligence, claiming that opinion polls did not sway his decision, and that he hoped instead to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democrat leader, declared that the terrifying Mr. Brown transformed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The takeover of Northern Rock, a struggling bank on the verge of crack, demonstrated flawed guidance and poor judgment in an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have provoked a coalition of industry groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from the tax authorities revealed an incredible administrative blunder.
A trio of retired generals have launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting military spending cuts: they have proclaimed that being defense minister is a part-time job for them.
At present, the suspicion of shady donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the General Secretary of Labor (and its ex-vigilante) made them resign.
None of this means Mr. Brown is headed for the exit.
However governments can come to a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don&#39;t like politicians, and don&#39;t trust them, but usually put their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even govern for long, when he risks suspension: the public administration no longer functions; ministers&#39; offices take stock; the press looks for bad stories; and the government becomes defensive and aimless.
In a sense, Mr. Brown&#39;s position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a rookie.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his superior lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and tax data, for example, relate to decisions Mr Brown made when he was Chancellor of the UK Treasury.
And even if he&#39;s not directly implicated in Blair&#39;s misfortunes, such as the long-running inquiry into the party&#39;s &quot;cash for members of the House of Lords&quot; funds, voters might think otherwise.
But Mr. Brown&#39;s predicament is not as tragic as it sounds.
The blunders are not as monstrous as Tory party members make them out to be.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, however painful, may be to embody Mr. Brown&#39;s lifelong Stalinist leanings in favor of reliable, mildly brutal government.
The new scandal over political donations is a good example.
Mr Abrahams, a very particular figure, who likens his donations to charity, said he wanted no public recognition of his benevolence.
He can have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of politicians&#39; big funders are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has a right to know who is contributing to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abrahams&#39; programs, without knowing that it was illegal, will therefore have to be questioned, as will Jon Mendlesohn, the head of fundraising who had spoken of the donations. questionable in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: There is no suggestion that he was aware of these steps, even if most of the payments made were made following his arrival in government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned his party&#39;s legislative flaw, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power rests on something he knows well, to appeal to a committee of inquiry on this subject. composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been flouted, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards of Public Life, which has been without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on party finance. policies.
This would oblige the Labor party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead it to renounce its special financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter like Mr. Brown.
But he would have to face some partisan facts.
The Conservative party now has a good advantage in the elections; he has two years to win back voters, and the only way to secure a victory is to demonstrate impeccable integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Could the mortgage crisis contaminate the US credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see fins fanned, swirling around.
Now that the US housing market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the US credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion spreads from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in the fees and insolvency rates, which measure the parts of the balance sheet that are not recoverable or that are, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in consumer credit, in part because of weak cardholders.
It&#39;s still too early to panic.
Fees and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody&#39;s, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% for the third quarter is almost a point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A 2005 change in laws in the United States regarding personal bankruptcy caused a steep drop in bankruptcy records, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and therefore insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers must pay.
and confidence in the safety of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicted that issue volume for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct infection links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their debt load now that fair mortgages are gone.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of cash rather than the value of wealth, and so the fall in property prices has not necessarily led to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to issuers of credit securities.
Premiums to consumers for paying mortgages fall if properties cost less than the value of the loan; consequently, credit card indebtedness would become a priority to repay everything.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgagers and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should in theory reduce the risk of having a quick rally in equities.
“We&#39;re not going to wake up one morning and reassess all the borrowings. declared Gary Perlin, the director of Capital One.
If a financial catastrophe of the credit card market is unlikely, there is a strong risk of having a consequent decline.
If lower housing prices and a contraction in the credit market push America into recession, the industry will certainly face a grim future.
Pay close attention to the dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case.
The three British bankers who were due to testify about their roles in a fraud committed by Enron&#39;s former chief financial officer, Mr Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had initially declared themselves innocent of seven charges of alleged collusive fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to enrich themselves at the expense of their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing presided over by US judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all declared themselves guilty of committing fraud.
The three ex-executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland&#39;s PLC group, have become famous throughout Great Britain because of the extradition proceedings which lasted two years.
In the United States, their case still remains an open question for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 made Fastow realize that he was the subject of the government&#39;s investigation into the Enron debacle.
The charges against the bankers, dubbed the &quot;Three from Natwest&quot; say they came to Houston in 2000, to set up a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his ex-right-hand man, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, which was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped it to fake the bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as nil, but in fact the three Britons already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the subsidiary&#39;s bank interest for £1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 as interest on this company.
According to the accused, Fastow falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was prepared to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth that $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers got $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others got $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endures a six-year incarceration in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcerated for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three Britons were released following the payment of $1million bail each, which obliges them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, previously the seventh largest national corporation, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of trick accounting, could no longer hide its billions in debt or even market its phony speculation as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of layoffs, more than $60 billion in lost market value, and more than $2 billion in loss to pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the company&#39;s collapse.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
Charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other misdemeanors were unsuccessful because of his death from a heart attack last year.
Neither under nor out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and having enough fuel autonomy to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts from $ 54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
&quot;It can carry up to 18 passengers,&quot; said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
&quot;Even though no one really needs that many seats since it&#39;s more of a family plane or for the president of a company.&quot;
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaire&#39;s Fair, a four-day consumer incentive orgy held in a huge exhibition center outside the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their booths, hoping to pique the interest of Russia&#39;s new rich in their varied products, ranging from mahogany yachts to diamond-filled cars like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was scrutinizing a shiny orange Porsche, displayed next to his stand.
“It&#39;s a nice car, but nothing like our product,” he said.
&quot;After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft.&quot;
&quot;Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, like Dallas&quot;
&quot;We went through the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans got so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialistic.&quot; said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar in the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the biggest spenders in the world.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of goods of luxury to markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, two-thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are globally worth $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists from the Center for Economic and Financial Research.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
&quot;There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that&#39;s why we&#39;re all here,&quot; said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweler.
She participated in the show for the first time with the Russian distributor, Le Groupe Bijoutier de Soho.
&quot;The women are all well prepared and the men are worth a fortune.&quot;
Strolling through the salon on Sunday evening, the two real estate agents put on their 31s, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 say they are like their clients, millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Ms. Yumatova, who clutched her couture gown like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The show seems primarily aimed at the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to line up in traffic jams to come to a huge warehouse where Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, custom pool tables, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
&quot;Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands,&quot; said Mr. Gijrath, posing proudly at the Dutch Delf porcelain factory Royal factory stand, in front of a hand-made wall painting by Raimbrant on blue tiles .
“It is certain that Russians are more interested in bling bling”
Indeed, sellers said here that Russians with old capital (10-15 years is too much by Russian standards) have already gone from flashy logos to some sort of limited-edition brand that couldn&#39;t sell at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, either millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, walk around the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of mattresses in silk, cashmere, and cotton encrusted with gold threads.
On the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales manager of A1 moto, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also said he sold the shiny orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000. .
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of LA Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would sell three wristband-like cars, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be encrusted with Swarovski crystals to look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconia, won&#39;t necessarily drive on such tires,” Karapetian said.
He will certainly keep it in his garage, which already contains 30 or 40 vehicles.
Even though many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr Karapetian said the phrase “Russian millionaire” is not on the agenda given the rise in property prices here.
“If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he declared.
“there are more than you might think”
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company erected four stalls representing British telephone booths, filled with masses of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company&#39;s marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 counterfeit tickets for the Millionaire Lounge.
Passers-by stopped to throw masses of banknotes, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or pocketing a few millions.
“You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karyev said.
Unlicensed surgeon suspected of New Jersey homicide
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked out the bay window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant and observed an ambulance that had just stopped at the gates of the white Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
and then another.
“Then I saw the medical vehicle stop,” Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, said on Wednesday.
That&#39;s when I realized someone had died.
Authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Investigators are now trying to determine if the cause of his death was due to a procedure performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, whom the police have not yet identified, residing at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Ms. Arroyo&#39;s death, but they are confidently awaiting the results of the toxicological tests which, alas, will take time, but which should make it possible to solve this mysterious death which has saddened the high ranks of the Newark Police.
Ms. Arroyo had been the assistant to the Director of Police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious,” Mr. McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday. »
“she was like a pit bull”
“She would have done anything to protect me”
Mr McCarthy said Miss Arroyo is married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Liquor Control Commission, and leaves behind two sons aged 14 and 11, as well as a beautiful girl.
Eileen Walsj, spokeswoman for Union County District Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine if Ms. Arroyo died from unauthorized surgery.
&quot;It&#39;s a possibility to consider. »
“the investigation is continuing. »
Authorities said they arrived at her home around 3 p.m.
and finding Miss Arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little over a week has passed, and authorities haven&#39;t said much about the investigation or even the owner of the home identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not confirm whether Ms. Castro was questioned by authorities.
Investigators are trying to figure out if part of the house was used as a doctor&#39;s office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Miss Castro&#39;s where a wilted rosebush lay in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian was barking in the back.
A blue can called &quot;Ethyl Vanillin&quot; used as a substitute for vanilla in cooking and for perfumes, lay in a shed, next to a door that leads to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung on the sides.
McCarthy said that since arriving in Newark 25 years ago at the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been invaluable, helping him navigate the new city and let go of its framed political culture.
&quot;She said &#39;you have to be careful with this and that&#39;,&quot; he said.
“She was there when I arrived, and still there when I left.
&quot;It was embarrassing&quot;
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will lower rates linked to the effervescence of the world stock market.
Stocks surged on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market hoped the Federal Reserve tried to calm credit conditions, later cutting interest rates boosted by soothing statements from the central bank&#39;s vice president. American.
Stock markets are exploding in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, said those who decide must be &quot;flexible and pragmatic&quot; in their actions in the troubled financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure irritated markets given these new credit-related strains, Kohn said the recent turbulence has partly “reversed some improvements in market functioning in late September and October.
Should this harsh turbulence persist, it would increase the odds of further tight financial conditions for homeowners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into US markets, and that further interest rate cuts could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped calm Wall Street with even worse news on the US economy, such as the biggest drop in home sales for the month of October.
The repercussions of this financial turmoil were accentuated following the declaration of Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it will lay off 650 people, that is to say, 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to compensate the heavy losses due to losing bets on mortgages.
Only 20 positions are planned in London where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 331 points, or 2.55% to 13,289.40, while the largest index, S&amp;P 500, gained 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index gained 165.5 points or 2.7%, concluding at 6306.2, adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index rose 2.6% and the French CAC40 gained 2.3%.
Previously, the reappearance of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted following the strong demand for an auction of tri-monthly funds issued by the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at the hefty rate 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the FED and ECB and inject further funds into London financial markets causing credit strains, as UK banks&#39; tri-monthly &#39;Libor&#39; borrowing rates, caused their highest growth since last September, at 6.59% following a strong rally since November 12.
England are facing a judgment call over criticism from Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be England&#39;s No.6 batsman in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in such a large context as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will decide?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the selectors who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the Chief Executive Officer of England, is starting to fill in the application forms to become a national coach, at least part time.
Anyone who fails to win bib number 6 will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and so is sport.
It is never easy to annihilate what allows one man to reach the top of his profession while another will never arrive beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck more than for lack of skill.
It&#39;s not just in cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, judging remains subjective.
Is the right time to bring out Bopara?
Is it fair compared to Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, who to choose between John Edwards or &quot;tubby&quot; Banerjee?; both, new executives having obtained good diplomas, professionals, should be promoted: but there is only place for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the fair level of a cricketer unless he is given at least a chance?
Numbers matter in decisions, but so do opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must catch the eye of the captain, at the same time he must take the door and a batsman must be lucky to hit the cricketer for a day.
But capturing the eyes of selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself to be in top form and continued to practice serving.
Anderson took 32 class-leading gates over 33 laps to gain a place.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 at the same average, but both have already had their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to deliver again.
Whether it will be Shah or Bopara playing at Asgiriya Stadium is just a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man&#39;s career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well in the first, with five gates and 40 useful rounds, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the quintessential Test cricketer, and that despite the fact that his double cent against Australia in Australia may still be underestimated.
Likelihood predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today&#39;s session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and favor Shah&#39;s greater experience over young Bopara&#39;s exuberance.
Both have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, his brilliant and considerable debut at the innings of the Bombay Test of 88, 32 cents in first class against six for Bopara, who at 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent placing at launch.
But Shah only made ten rounds in his two innings in May against the Caribbean in the Test at Lord, his Middlesex home town, and that, the immediate rejection by coaches when Vaughan, fit again, demanded his place for the next match, seems to have afflicted his so obvious impulses in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joie de vivre.
Nothing scares him on a cricket pitch and he went overboard when he recently flipped over a 4x4 during a presentation by England sponsor Volkswagen.
He reported only minor injuries, was shocked, although the first thing he did was grab his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was watching him from afar, to ask s &quot; &#39;he had seen that? »
Bopara is by far the best batsman, his shooting pace allows him to do services that suit him, and which he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right moment is another.
Maybe this is the true art of selection?
I would be in favor of giving Bopara a chance, but that doesn&#39;t mean Shah shouldn&#39;t apply himself if, as the tea leaves suggest, he will be playing this weekend.
The buses bring people back to work, and to fight against al Qaeda.
The first busload of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, dumping those exiles with no money or visa renewals, or others who hope the city has returned to normality.
Some returned to fight against the militants who drove them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival from Damascus of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who made their way back.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdas,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now. »
“They say the Mahdi army is not committing crimes anymore! he said, referring to church activist Moqtada al-Sadr&#39;s Shia militia, which has ordered its men to stand aside for the time being.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevents Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the US-backed militia helped drive Al Qaeda out of the west of the capital, and invited him back.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home in northern Baghdad due to a grenade attack after he incited citizens to rebel against al-Qaeda .
But he had to go back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys. »
&quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;m going home today,&quot; said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have been drawn to the growing calm in the capital since US troops arrived, and to the continued formation of well-armed &quot;engaged citizens groups&quot; working with the US military to defend their neighborhoods.
But still others say they were forced to return because of visa problems and the decay of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, expressed the suspicion felt by all about visas for exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, who allegedly asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people are said to have fled the country because of the sectarian death squads.
“We didn&#39;t have a problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,” the retired Sunni said.
&quot;I can&#39;t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house when I left.&quot;
The drop in violence can be partly explained by the fact that Sunnis have been driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are lower.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees could again increase sectarian tensions and bring back fighting.
Petite Sarre, good training.
The smallest federal state leads in professional training, and even shines with the international orientation of its colleges.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Saarland, similar to that of the rest of the country.
&quot;I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Saar, that we are not French&quot; - this is the slogan that the smallest federated state, in self-mockery, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a large role in the training system of Saarland, a system which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the Institute of German Economics in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, the higher education institutions cooperate closely with neighboring countries.
The university was founded in Saarbrücken in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students have the possibility of completing their studies there with a double or even a triple diploma.
This is evidenced by the high proportion of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
Saarland also takes the country&#39;s children to college in above-average numbers - many of them without a gymnasium diploma.
&quot;In Saarland, we take advantage of the vocational training system&quot;, says Axel Plünnecke, training expert at IW.
More than one young person in five obtains their diploma in a vocational school, thus the Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
Also the possibilities of combining professional and academic training are relatively well developed.
Considering the number of inhabitants, the dual degree program is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
This is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has forced higher education institutions to launch a marketing campaign in engineering sciences.
&quot;After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a lot of reforms in general schools,&quot; said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government has introduced comparison tests throughout the federated state.
In order for the children to start learning earlier, the last year of crèche is free of charge - a model that other federal states are now also copying.
Only future comparison studies will be able to show whether student performance improves in a lasting way.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the proportion of students at risk was reduced from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, Saarland has not improved as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians are doing better.
And to the chagrin of the Saar people, knowledge of foreign languages is not measured by the PISA studies - otherwise one could earn points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbor is compulsory in high schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez sets the clocks
In Venezuela, watches will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will set the clock back half an hour in the South American country.
Chavez meanwhile becomes a caricature in Spain.
As Venezuela&#39;s official gazette reported, due to a new law, watches will be set to minus four and a half hours from universal time.
In this way, the South American country gets a time zone that does not exist in any other state in the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position among other things by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the termination of relations with the neighboring country, Colombia, due to a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would maintain relations neither with the head of state nor with the Colombian government.
&quot;I can&#39;t, already only because of my dignity,&quot; said Chávez, who is hastening a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by way of referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, he would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe&#39;s decision to withdraw Chávez&#39;s mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have &quot;spit in the face&quot; of Venezuela with this decision, Chávez criticized on Sunday.
In Spain too Chávez is on everyone&#39;s lips.
A new mobile phone ringtone is all the rage in the country: &quot;Por qué no te callas&quot; (why don&#39;t you shut up) is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded from the internet.
It was spoken by Spain&#39;s King Juan Carlos, who at the most recent Ibero-American summit was angered by the constant pleas from left-wing populists and told him to shut up.
A drop in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, according to a forecast, a real wage loss threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect a real reduction in their payslip in 2007 compared to the previous year.
&quot;The fault lies with the weak development of wages, the increase in the Value Added Tax and the rises in the prices of food products and energy,&quot; said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and research on the economic situation, in the newspaper &quot;Bild&quot;.
New charges could also arise in terms of unemployment insurance for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper &quot;Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung&quot; that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance by 3.3 percent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to find itself in the embarrassment of asking the Federation for credits or financial aid, in the words of the SPD politician.
We learned on Tuesday that the explosion in food and fuel prices had pushed the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices rose 3.0 percent year over year.
Venus is Earth&#39;s infernal twin.
Despite its atmosphere hostile to life, Venus looks more like Earth than previously thought: the European space probe &quot;Venus Express&quot; has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind vortices at the poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lightning on Venus.
The European probe &quot;Venus Express&quot; today provided proof of this - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: lightning on Venus erupts at a height of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California at Los Angeles in the scientific magazine &quot;Nature&quot;.
According to the famous theory of love juice, the lightning would have brought life to Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans which led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: &quot;If there was life, it must have been at a very early date in history&quot;, explains Sean Solomon of the &quot;Carnegie Institution&quot; in Washington.
Today there should be hardly any living things on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
&quot;Venus may be Earth&#39;s hellish twin, but she&#39;s still a twin,&quot; said Russel.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and dimensions, was struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of &quot;Venus Express&quot; in November 2005 was an important step in Venusian research, since no more probes had been on their way to explore this planet since the nineties.
According to the researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several &quot;Nature&quot; articles do not only underline the singularity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the points in common with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more numerous than supposed at first sight.
Thus the researchers found, in addition to the swirls of wind already known at the North Pole, a swirl of clouds at the South Pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet called the evening or morning star orbits the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much more slowly on itself: a Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, bears little resemblance to Earth, scientists assume that the two planets were formed under similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated and remained on Earth as oceans, but was lost to space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has settled on Earth as carbonate, on Venus it makes up most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel&#39;s meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands an end to the quarrel between parties over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for the attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares about Germany&#39;s appearance and calls on the Grand Coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
&quot;We must not present to the outside world a nation divided on this issue,&quot; Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have a universal validity, even if I have respect for the differences between cultures” said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, underlined the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against accusations that she was organizing a new China policy.
The German Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional One China policy.
&quot;China knows it too&quot;, said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly made his displeasure known about the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for it outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier complained in particular about the CDU&#39;s &quot;front door policy&quot; in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery, virulent irritations made themselves felt in German-Chinese relations.
Thus the Chinese government not only canceled German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to information from Spiegel, also froze the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
China&#39;s Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is now demanding German Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that hosting the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refuses that European politicians receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official functions, Wen Jiabao supported the Chinese position.
The words and deeds of the Dalai Lama would show that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also includes other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fights with the police, shootings, cars on fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Everything must be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not burst into the streets with violence, demanded the German Interior Minister.
Burning barricades, thugs shooting at the police with shotguns: after the serious youth riots in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not also build up at home and defuse into violence.
We must take this seriously,&quot; he told the &quot;Neue Presse&quot; published in Hanover.
Not all young individuals would cope with the rapidly changing social reality.
The Federation, the federated states and the municipalities were already working hard to reduce the problems, said Schäuble.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
&quot;From integration summits to conferences on Islam, it is already showing its first successes.&quot;
However, it would be too early for an end to the alert.
Schäuble points out at the same time that in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems nor from the point of view of town planning as in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings burned.
Greater integration efforts on the part of the German government were demanded by the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Given the riots in France, Kolat warned against &quot;imitation effects&quot;.
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need to act.
Kolat emphasizes the fact that the quota of unemployed young people under 25 with an immigrant background would be higher than average.
Above all, more training places should be provided.
Kolat insisted: &quot;We have to give young people a perspective&quot;.
The President of the Turkish communities added, however, that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigrant backgrounds also do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged: &quot;But we still have to be careful.&quot;
Young people should be &quot;quickly given the opportunity to participate in work and training&quot;.
Meanwhile, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very calm during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter hovered over the area with searchlights.
The authorities in office reported three arrests as well as some cars and garbage cans burned.
Since the conference, a deployment of around 1,000 security forces has ensured calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, unrest spilled over to Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two youths lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the prosecution, the police are not responsible for the death of the young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The chancellor&#39;s utopian appearance shows that the coalition is done with substance - and that there is nothing more to be expected of it.
In which country does this Chancellor live?
After her distressing intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country which should, in the end, be governed by her.
The reproach of focusing too much on politics was dismissed by Angela Merkel with a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It&#39;s provincial, she said and only showed that she doesn&#39;t want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, she made visible to all how accurate this reproach was.
There was neither concrete interest nor hardly any feelings for the problems of the country to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a politician in weightlessness, who flees into foreign policy and who even there remains in the approximation.
For example, climate protection: in this area, she again and again welcomes the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how the climate objectives are to be achieved in our country.
Even, self-praise - to have so little modesty the CDU leader would have refused even two years ago.
Now she clings to ready-made formulas, that growth would affect people.
It thereby destroys its image as a pragmatist, who solves problems instead of embellishing the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic political issues are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
He has a few accessory phrases left for that.
In this matter, the number of times she slips up when it comes to family allowance is revealing.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to utter a half-accurate phrase.
She staggers into unknown territory, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack branch
In Youtube&#39;s debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are fighting a tough offensive battle - and must now fear an underdog candidate.
The tension of the candidates already bursts at the first subject.
He would have made New York a &quot;refuge for illegal immigrants&quot;, reproaches Mitt Romney to his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This one counters on his side with heavy reproaches: &quot;I would say that his own house was a haven for illegal immigrants&quot; replies Giuliani and reproaches the former governor of Massachusetts for having employed undocumented immigrants.
The candidates go on the attack: as the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debates on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second home movies that internet users have uploaded via Youtube are little more than prompters.
&quot;It&#39;s with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power,&quot; John McCain says to his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney, too, is being lectured vigorously by Vietnam veterans when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called “waterboarding,” an interrogation method that simulates drowning.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign meanwhile go beyond the war in Iraq and the debates on torture can be seen in the reactions of the common room in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Whether conservative values are praised or future tax hikes are denied, applause ripples through the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favorites are once again revealed.
“I made a mistake at that time,” Romney explains contritely and apologizes to the base and the televised public for having in 1994 still been a supporter of abortion.
Giuliani on the contrary goes into a noose when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf rules for the first time in civilian clothes.
A day after stepping down as army chief, Pakistani powerhouse Musharraf was sworn in as president.
Thus eight years of domination by the army come to an end.
Pakistan&#39;s President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for a new five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf has sworn to uphold the Constitution and act for the welfare of the Nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bowed to international pressure, particularly that of the United States.
Eight years after taking power in a bloodless putsch, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil status.
By withdrawing from the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency that Musharraf declared on November 3.
Already soon after his inauguration Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfill another demand of the West.
The country&#39;s Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of a state of emergency with lawyers from his ranks, had last week rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile five soldiers have been killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others injured.
According to the indications of the spokesman of the army, a bomb exploded in a street near the border of Afghanistan.
The fathers of Krautrock are making a comeback.
Germany&#39;s supergroups of the seventies play again: the three members of the group Harmonia once again took their consoles to a concert in Berlin.
For their comeback came recordings of their big hit &quot;Live 1974&quot;.
Already at that time they were much better known abroad.
The anticipated sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced for the evening show.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
He is flanked on the left by Michael Rother, 57 years old and in possession of a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, watched by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends over his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, among others even a Beat.
And sometimes it inadvertently adds to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves too much.
The fact that the group Harmonia is playing again has ensured some excitement among Krautrock fans.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted polls reveal that, of course, the name resonates in the collective memory of pop, but by no means so enduring as this group has been so painfully missing for 32 years.
But why shouldn&#39;t the Germans also have the right to celebrate their living legends of the seventies?
Especially since what is deceptively called &quot;Krautrock&quot; has always been more popular in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the survivors of the Cologne band Can the Echo Prize in 2003 for their work, the questioning German pop faces were seen in the room.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in panegyric praise, astonishment had no limits.
Later, during gigs, Michael Rother would hop onto the Red Hot Chili Peppers stage like an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration into the unknown is the one and only.
The memory is therefore already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and that during this period, the power of impact which was felt was much weaker than what was attributed to it by followed by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
We first played in the cellars below the Berlin stage.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly helped out in Kraftwerk and eventually made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, perhaps the most radical German band at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile in the forests of Weserbergland.
There, in an old Weser farmhouse, a 16th century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the &quot;Kommune I&quot; community, where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nanny.
Rather an artistic existence in the manner of Spitzweg.
Supposedly in the trash was a pennant of the Harmonia Ottenstein choir and also a name for the art.
Many held Harmonia away from this.
The first album was called &quot;Musik von Harmonia&quot;, and the following one &quot;De Luxe&quot;.
Because as serene and modest as the music sounded, the group suffered from material misery.
Harvesting dead wood alone was not for self-seeking.
The CD &quot;Live 1974&quot; which has just been released was recorded during a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of nearly 50 heads, as someone thinks they remember.
Rother expressed at this time the wish to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
This was for Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The group announced their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and ensured his existence with albums like &quot;Flammende Herzen&quot; (hearts in flames).
Cluster revived in the eighties and has since had more success than Harmonia ever had.
We owe Griessem&#39;s Live album to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His Grönland label has set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
New! had already been unearthed on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
Harmonia&#39;s physical resurrection takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, former punk and author of the paperback &quot;Krautrock Sampler&quot;.
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire fluctuation margin of Krautrock influence would be identified with respect to future pop music.
The place left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno&#39;s sentence hovers in the room amid the singular sounds: &quot;The only real music, you listen to the future&quot;.
There are photos that show the producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
Projections of other black and white photos of corded tools in a mess serve to form the caption.
In front, the three veterans are once again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and the drums, to draw unheard sounds from the instruments thanks to the instruments with effects built oneself.
Today, electronic music sounds like electronic music.
The three in great polishers of technique.
Even the house choir won&#39;t change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a nice moment &quot;Aaaaaaaah&quot; with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the flight from artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever shouts &quot;68&quot; isn&#39;t totally wrong, and Harmonia doesn&#39;t get irritated by that anymore either.
But what is most self-evident will be thoroughly covered on stage.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
It can get on someone&#39;s nerves (?) or it can grant fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere just isn&#39;t cynical enough.
With &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; and &quot;Murderous Peace&quot;, two films deal again with the Balkan war.
But the two are not convincing.
Either the projects are based too much on action and insane exchanges of fire or, on the contrary, they are too tearful.
Here, even Richard Gere in &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; can&#39;t help.
The good news first: certainly the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it is precisely there, in the darkest hinterland of the Bosnian war, that the actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had finally lost sight of the most handsome man of the eighties, because far too many nice and frivolous roles in sentimental films for women and far too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism robbed him of the want to show off.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument for watching &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; anyway - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why do today&#39;s films have to be as long and confusing as collective driver agreements locomotives?)
He delivers a magnificent portrayal full of winks: basically, his war reporter character Simon Hunt is what Gere might have become, if fate and the film industry weren&#39;t so benevolent: a man who has its best times long behind it, but which, even as a crumbling monument to its decline, still retains visible remnants of its former charm.
But despite this advantage, &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; continues together with the German production &quot;Murderous Peace&quot;, which is also released this week, the endless series of failed films on the Balkan war.
From &quot;Murderous Peace&quot; we can quickly make the trial: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian woman from the Kosovar snipers, in which one of the two still quickly falls in love.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are for once not presented as the sole cause of all evil, this film as flat as a TV movie is lost far too quickly in the action and the insane exchanges of fire .
It remains a kind of &quot;Alarm for Cobra 11&quot; without a highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, one can examine in the perfect example of &quot;The Hunting Party&quot;, why basically there was never a really good film about the Balkan war.
The story of the three American war reporters, who condition themselves to track the high war criminal &quot;the fox&quot;, could perhaps have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both at the same time Richard Shepard), another time a new &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;.
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go as a small team into the forest, to accomplish something the military cannot do and for both males it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; fails is that Simon Hunt is simply not allowed to be the deserted cynic with a heart he is introduced to us at the start.
No, the script must additionally attribute to him a romantic affair with a Bosnian woman subsequently murdered.
Then &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, in the space of the last five minutes, by a fast-track process, manages to do what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have not succeeded in five years: catch the war criminal and leave him for a just revenge to the Bosnian Muslims.
It&#39;s so bad that we should seize the International Court of The Hague for crimes against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must exceptionally agree) of not conducting the hunt intensively enough because of secret political agreements.
But the well-intentioned and the wicked are so similar this time around that a famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
This one speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet&#39;s work table: &quot;Compassionate, I see the veins in the forehead swollen, clearly: how tiring it is to be wicked.&quot;
Movies like &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; have exactly such tumescent heads, but hinting at how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan war films.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been any good films about South Africa.
Which applies every time: When a star drags on a hotbed or on a minefield, then something like &quot;Rangoon&quot; with Patricia Arquette, &quot;Jenseits aller Grenzen&quot; with Angelina Jolie or &quot;&quot;Blutdiamanten&quot; comes out with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all of these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
Either way, decades still passed before Hollywood could make a good holocaust movie with &quot;Schindler&#39;s List.&quot;
Some films still have to mature - those which today are worth classic works on Vietnam &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; or &quot;Full Metal Jackett&quot; were by no means unanimously celebrated in their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we now also know just too much about the conflicts of the world, where every slaughter happens live on two screens at the same time at home,
And that robs the screenwriters of the lack of scruples they need to tell great stories.
&quot;To Be or Not To Be&quot; or &quot;The Dictator&quot; actually got that good too because Lubtisch and Chaplin didn&#39;t yet know just how dominant the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn&#39;t want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps it is necessary to have the sarcastic and distanced artistic glance of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel &quot;Dictionnaire de Lemprière&quot; and the Balkan war, he replied: &quot;It&#39;s only because some things never change&quot;.
&quot;Big cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be horribly murdered and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.&quot;
Von Beust collects criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The mayor&#39;s stepping back from Hamburg&#39;s candidacy for the Summer Olympics has come up against fierce criticism in politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the Games at the water&#39;s edge.
But Von Beust calls for realism in assessing the odds.
The chief director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday described an abandonment as &quot;bad for the local economy&quot;.
In recent times, no other project has unleashed such motivating forces in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
&quot;Without this objective, the politico-sporting momentum could not have been maintained to the same extent&quot;.
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new starting point for it in the longer term, &quot;which takes as a starting point another modified agenda&quot;.
Mayor Ole von Beust on Wednesday stood by his previous statements that Hamburg&#39;s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic until at least the year 2028.
“It is not Hamburg that decides on a candidacy for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation,” Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Sports Federation in early December, about Munich&#39;s bid for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us that, in the time frame we had planned until 2028 so far, we won&#39;t have a chance.&quot;
However, the dream is not definitely a thing of the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust&#39;s statements.
From this the impression would be given that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympics in the next 25 years.
&quot;It is too early to close an opportunity, by burying the projects already now&quot;, said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the candidacy would also be in contradiction with the declarations of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the reception in full assembly of the German Federation of higher sports schools.
There, Von Beust reportedly called Hamburg&#39;s 2015 Universiade bid &quot;not a substitute&quot; for the Hamburg Olympics.
The Federation of Sports Colleges had first nominated Hamburg as a candidate city in the past weeks.
The SPD fraction of the mayor criticized the Senate for not having used this precious time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
&quot;The development of Little Grasbrook was denied by the Senate for years because it played the Olympiad card and excluded housing construction,&quot; said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for a plan integrated into the Olympics and subsequent use of the accommodation for the Petit Grasbrook, the CDU would have relied exclusively on the &quot;Event factor&quot;.
The candidacy for the Summer Olympics in 2012 would have aroused great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg had however broken against Leipzig.
These are not the cases of Warhols.
Whoever connects the concepts Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or if?
Right now, wooden cases made in Sweden are casting shadows over the list of Warhol&#39;s works.
Many of the ninety &quot;Stockholm Type&quot; Brillo-Boxes listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper &quot;Expressen&quot; questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol&#39;s Brillo-Boxes from the year 1968 a few months ago, the internal research of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm today leads to a disenchanting result: the six &quot;Brillo-Boxes&quot;, which the former museum director Pontus Hulten donated to the Moderna Museet in 1995, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of &quot;Stockholm-type&quot; Brillo-Boxes, which circulate on the international art market.
Ancient history is entangled, a bewildering chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York his first &quot;Brillo-Boxes&quot;, painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of &quot;Brillo&quot; soap powder cartons.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with Warhol&#39;s agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to have a few Brillo wooden boxes produced in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time speak today of about fifteen wooden boxes which at the time would have entered by right into the history of art and auctions, as authorized original Brillo-Boxes by Andy Wahrol , with the designation &quot;Type Stockholm&quot;.
Some of them have fetched over $100,000 at auction.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén wrongly claimed later that around one hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then ceded to him.
In truth, the 105 cases of Hultén were produced in Malmö in 1990 only, for an exhibition in St Petersburg.
By this date, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, alongside the museum&#39;s six Brillo-Boxes, three others from private Swedish collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and sanded, then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The texture of the copies dating from the year 1990 reveals on the contrary that the paint was directly applied without primer on the laminated panels, using a paint roller - moreover it is not a question of an oil painting, but an acrylic.
&quot;These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official Andy Warhol Brillo-Boxes list&quot;, suggests Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve: &quot;If the &#39;Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board&#39; in New York does not come another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six cases in its collection as copies/exhibition material.&quot;
Already in July the Authentication Board has of course announced that it will investigate the &quot;heavy charges&quot; which will be raised in the case of the powdered soap boxes.
But since then we have been surrounded by an inexorable silence.
Manila Rebel Soldiers Surrender
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers give up, the same ones who had taken refuge in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chef Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the President for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel that he could not answer for any bloodshed.
The soldiers loyal to the government had shortly before stormed the hotel using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had entrenched themselves in the building for hours.
About half of them were standing in court on Wednesday due to a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly disappear with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who would normally have to watch them, had apparently deserted in his favor and joined in his mutiny.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the removal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Troops loyal to the government cordoned off the area around the respectable hotel.
The President called an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers&#39; action.
&quot;People are tired of it,&quot; said Trillanes.
&quot;We are calling on people to join us.&quot;
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the elite Scout Rangers unit, said other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Critics of the regime had called for a large demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
The financial district of Manila was already since 2003 the scene of the attempted mutiny of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo.
The uprising broke down nearly 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986 there have already been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a principal shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 percent from the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as communicated by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 percent of the share capital would be held.
We had already speculated before about a takeover.
The option would remain open to further increase the stake in Versatel.
With this step one seeks to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, communicated United Internet.
Just before that, speculation had already been made about an entry on Wednesday, after Bank Berenberg increased its stake in the Düsseldorf grid operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institute would only hold the money for a third party, the market is told.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a stake of nearly 10 percent in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares on the stock exchange with a value of 106.4 million euros.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, the companies have opened negotiations regarding cooperation in the marketing of DSL and mobile telephony products.
&quot;We are strengthening our partnership,&quot; explained a United Internet spokesperson.
The two companies founded the joint venture MSP in order to absorb competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not make use of their right to endorse an additional 18.49 percent in Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
The two companies would however leave all options open, in particular to increase the stake in SA Freenet, we learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet over a strategic partnership ended in mid-October.
Poker still difficult to predict on Freenet which has lasted for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers bound by a mobile telephony contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
United Internet and Drillisch Holding previously held a direct stake in Freenet of 6.01 percent.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will contribute around four percent more.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
