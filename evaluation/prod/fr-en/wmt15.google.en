The UKIP dwellers who refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You talk about when Nigel Farage says the NHS shouldn&#39;t be used to pay for those who come to the UK for health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer asks him specifically whether people living with HIV are included in the undesirables.
First you use specious arguments, then you discredit them with thinly veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to queue behind intolerant chronic hypochondriacs who think they are entitled to everything.
I believe you are the one using specious arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by right-wing crackpots, practically does not exist.
I believe this is called democracy.
Then nobody would be affected by UKIP&#39;s measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
Only in the parallel universe of UKIP can Carswell come across as a revolutionary.
A quote taken from a rag does not constitute proof.
Yes, shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, it only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don&#39;t think you know what a specious argument is.
You also don&#39;t know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with accusations of homophobia.
Farage&#39;s sentence surprised many, but only because this problem is so rarely talked about.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You will have to manage to recover from it.
I&#39;m not sure where you&#39;re coming from, but I imagine you don&#39;t like it when the media talks about what you don&#39;t like.
It is talked about so rarely because unlike Farage and his crazed Thatcher followers who think that AIDS and the floods are a sign from god and not a reflection of their own failure to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good thing, then no.
Finally the situation is as rotten in Ireland as in Spain.
With the new crisis coming, the period of austerity will not have helped.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland the &#39;&#39;TIGER OF EUROPE&#39;&#39; we were boasted about, a few years ago.
We knew what happened next!
This starts reading the article again.
They try to pretend that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a &#39;&#39;NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE&#39;&#39; is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, the lowest corporate taxes in Europe, a very flexible labor market, continuing emigration.
With these ingredients not enough to &#39;&#39;rejoice&#39;&#39; for the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 80s of the twentieth century, ireland was one of the poorest countries in the european union, together with portugal Considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was .
Greece was ahead.
That their development has not been a long calm river is clear from recent events.
Lowest tax rate in Europe?
It&#39;s wrong!
Latvia has a 0% corporate tax rate.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on the taxes actually paid by the multinationals.
If we believe a report released in 2008 or 2009, they pay in France less than 5% in general.
Only SMEs pay full price.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars on every street corner, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have lived in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily traffic jams since the start of the school year.
Is this supposed to be business news?
Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m sure the comments will heat up soon.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astras are involved in a collision on the A140.
Does Ryanair now plan to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I believe Mr. O&#39;Leary will soon be buying a whole new fleet of devices, so a few dents and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said I&#39;m flying with him next week so hopefully it won&#39;t be on either of those two once patched up.
So it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair charge passengers extra for the extra fear we kindly provided?
But without that kind of Irish business you couldn&#39;t afford to go on holiday, young man
I have never flown Ryanair and the last 3 times I have flown have been with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it&#39;s Ryanair, so they can have a blast.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never fly Ryanair to those who like to fly Ryanair and think those who pay anything other than the base fare just have to blame themselves, etc.
It&#39;s pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be happy with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays are going to be and whether passengers will have to be compensated and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an error by the air traffic controllers of the &#39;airport.
The passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
Sorry to disappoint you and your compensation dreams.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight which takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Have a good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrianized, and literally teeming with people.
People don&#39;t come in droves for the quality of the restaurants (nondescript, for the most part) or for the Salon de la Revue at the Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the area is incredibly lively and bustling.
With lots of foreigners spending.....
Do you think Sunday opening will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sundays, packed with people with 50% tourists.
@aloes Wrong!
The only argument that seems admissible to me is that of the areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy duty free.
Tourist areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons.
There remains the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sundays, makes it possible to lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right enjoyed by employees, with some exceptions.
This is the reason why it is provided for and regulated by the labor code.
Neither the minister in charge of the economy, nor, moreover, that in charge of foreign affairs, has the slightest competence to reform the labor code.
As they close it.
What is the law for?
To satisfy part of the population and companies wishing to work on Sundays.
In Montreal on Sunday afternoon I take my grandchildren to the municipal library.
In my city of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France, the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not on weekends!
This is access to culture...
And this is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he tenaciously defended against fascism
the way of life he tenaciously defended against fascism and Bolshevism
What if her daughter&#39;s estate was, against her will, used to pay inheritance costs?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some not so good.
No doubt his estate would like its share of the pie, if you will pardon the expression.
his preference for a Nationalist/Franco victory in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
Me neither.
But for 5 years, and only for 5 years, he was perfect.
In 1940 he stood up to other government aristocrats who wanted to discuss a &quot;deal&quot; with the Nazis and he very ably won.
With his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the belief that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The people of the United Kingdom, and of France, and of Belgium and, ultimately, the whole world, can thank God for having had for these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the helm and no other.
Churchill&#39;s greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
If his descendants sell the paintings on the open market to raise the money for inheritance costs, they might even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, they must raise the money to buy it.
It&#39;s that simple.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was &quot;the moment of truth&quot;, Churchill&#39;s personality was a positive advantage for his country during the Second World War.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only favor large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, as infrastructure sites are by definition not very renewable.
As for the social reforms recommended by the minister, they clearly reflect the real French evil: distrust of dialogue
Back to original values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the weakest among us not be in need!
Either jointly we come to his aid, or he has the RIGHT in exchange for the services he renders or has rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer at minimum wage corresponds to this vision.
There is also the lessor who lives off the income from his properties.
It is necessary to differentiate between those who invest for a return at the time of their retirement and those who live on their pensions.
A property for rent or even two for a couple above, it&#39;s vice
The little financial genius is singularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of major works, but at a time of lack of major infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and in France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of degrowth is emerging in response to a recession which is only a wild and therefore brutal decrease
You would have been right 30 years ago: no more need (or possibility) of dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investment is crying out: insulation, renovation of the rail network, urban transport, transport and storage of energy, etc.
Taxation that favors high incomes and pensioners.
Who is in power?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a rascal.
Samsung&#39;s profits are hurt by the iPhone 6 and its similar competitors
Apple&#39;s mid-September introduction of larger screens for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have appealed to buyers who otherwise would have purchased a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided on the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not to Apple.
I believe it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft implemented this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple, and the open source community.
We must have several dynamic platforms, to stimulate competition and development.
Besides, we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and appreciate the design.
Some people do not value design, for them options, functionality and price come first.
There is nothing wrong with that.
Let&#39;s stop looking for &quot;a better platform&quot;.
Is there &quot;a better car manufacturer&quot;, not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving mobile industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It&#39;s healthier and should be encouraged.
This is in the interest of all of us.
I&#39;m glad you found exactly what you were looking for and it wasn&#39;t an Apple product, although I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, of course, Parisian sores) could they tell us from which author(s) they fight ideas on the genre and tell us which works they intend to combat.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Valeurs Actuelles?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I like you, and you&#39;re an intelligent and cultured person.
I said that about Judith in the vein of Furusato evoking Holofernes, a comparison that hadn&#39;t occurred to me (I don&#39;t have her quick-wittedness).
Otherwise, basically, since you refer to it, this subject does not interest me, and sincerely I do not see where the problem is: I was hoping that you and your friends could get me out of my retardation, because I am slow but I understand...
@Jean: Recognize that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holofernes does it.
Who is afraid wonders the World?
But what are those who are afraid of?
Furasato and @ give us some answers.
The first by invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat-slicer.
We see how much these studies touch on the most intimate part of them.
We are obviously no longer in the debate of ideas.
It&#39;s something else, much deeper.
@ Have you read, Jean, that Le Monde published an article on the need for theology?
@: Being a debate of idea I thought that it was advisable to go to the sources.
Claiming to fight ideas from the only presentation made of them by their detractors (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem very rigorous to me.
But hey, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, it&#39;s all the difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I&#39;m not sure that he understood the nuance.
I didn&#39;t read Judith, the very symbolic throat-slicer, I contented myself with &quot;Second Sex&quot; (it was more in my time) which I believe is the source of &quot;the source&quot; according to Lo&#39;s wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights as the moon briefly rose as the clouds parted.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and somewhat compensated for the disappointment of sometimes having the view blocked by clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night&#39;s cloud really hugged the Victoria and NSW coast, while most of the rest of Australia had clear skies.
Special blood moon flash.
Tony Abbott/Joe Hockey blame Labor.
But if Labor accepts our unfair budget, we will restore it to its true color as soon as possible.
You&#39;re obsessed, right?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I only saw clouds.
Melbourne also managed to blanket itself for the entire week from the Perseid meteor shower and for virtually every significant astronomical phenomenon in recent years.
I&#39;m beginning to think there&#39;s an evil genie whose sole purpose is to prevent the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne really isn&#39;t the best place for an observatory, although things are looking up a lot on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were 10 to 20 minute periods when I couldn&#39;t see the eclipse due to the clouds over suburban Melbourne.
I will put a TAX on this eclipse.
ANYONE who watches this eclipse should pay a TAX.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, as is your last before bed.
Who or what will you obsess about when it (necessarily) ends up disappearing?
It seems like you spend a lot of time reading threads looking for posts where people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse THEM of being obsessed.
Stunning shot of the moon over Sydney Harbor Bridge.
It looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth!
Nothing on stock market and real estate speculation.
Nothing on the inequalities between labor and capital income.
Nothing about tax evasion.
Ultra liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon...
The article says either too much or not enough.
The details and arguments for these recommendations are not given.
No hypertext link to the original documents so that we can form an opinion.
Go see today Tuesday, October 15 the results of miracle recipes: in Spain, exports are at their lowest for five years.
In Greece the stock market is collapsing.
Yet these are the examples to follow.
The reform of notaries would generate a claim for compensation of around 8 billion euros.
The Ministry of the Economy tells us that these claims for compensation are unfounded.
What in the event of an error by the Ministry of the Economy?
Will the decision-makers who have reaped the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack by the notaries have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The sequel in time.
Ok, thank you, JYL....
@lol No, the State is not comparable to households in terms of managing its budget because the time horizon of the State is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the lifespan of its members.
In addition, unless public expenditure is considered unproductive, it contributes to financing material and immaterial investments that guarantee tomorrow&#39;s growth and therefore future revenue.
A few answers.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred Hippocratic oath: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved above all else.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately the truth does not match your fantasy.
The medical staff would like to be able to use it, but their hands are tied by the law as written by the politicians.
It&#39;s the same situation as the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgeries, safe shoot rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, and so on.
On these issues the politicians want to please the uneducated masses.
By the way, doctors don&#39;t make money from drugs.
That&#39;s why there are pharmacists.
doctors don&#39;t make money on drugs Since the Liberals want our health care system to look like the United States, you should find out how it works.
Everywhere in the world doctors are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been poorly worded to blame the medics, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, prioritize corporate profits and &#39;research&#39;.
So read the few rare reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme spending and negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare global drug prices everywhere, as well as country-to-country differences in what is over-the-counter or prescription-only.
This reinforces itself, it is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are now experimenting with marijuana inhalations for oncological pain, despite the laws against them and the expensive permits required.
Although the manufacturers of some drugs may not be happy with alternatives such as marijuana, those who manage to come up with a version that offers good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
Sorry to tell you madam but you are wrong, there is a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put a flea in the ear of a person in charge of this hospital.
You can&#39;t HOLD patents on weed...
If social science “researchers” did research instead of politics and networking, perhaps their “work” could be used.
A researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not searching.
Comparing is teaching, not research.
You can&#39;t say “the research is done, you have to apply it” and then in the same stream, “you have to experiment at all costs”.
If your research is successful, why experiment?
If your research is not successful, why are you asking that they be applied?
Can someone explain to me how a “researcher” can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could assimilate mathematics and other subjects more easily?
The new technologies make it possible to learn on the condition that the pupils learn to use the new technologies, but how would they manage to learn the new technologies if they do not know how to learn?
The pisa tests are only an indicator let&#39;s make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What is the point of building an indicator that informs you of what suits you, a desire for self-promotion, a deception?
A single track to train teachers: remove from training the sophists and ideologues and that practitioners teach practitioners.
fabrice re-read the paragraph on the internships (which unfortunately is not very well argued) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most ineffective conservatism: &quot;It is a device which leads above all to the reproduction of the practices in force, and which does not allow the system to progress”.
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, we cannot wish that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have their place in modern teacher training.
Educational theorists should have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating theater before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems in the education system.
To give more weight to the theoreticians of education would be to destroy it definitively.
Your analogy is totally flawed: if I would not like to be operated on by a practitioner who has only theoretical training, I would even less like to be operated on by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned about the heap.
Mike Weatherley, the Tory MP in charge of cracking down on David Cameron&#39;s copyright infringement
Why doesn&#39;t he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thank you.
If I ever start to feel guilty about copyright infringement, all I have to do is read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement = theft.
It&#39;s the same thing since they must cite their sources correctly.
Often, obtaining a license costs nothing.
No, it&#39;s copyright infringement.
Not the same thing at all.
By using content without the proper license, you deprive artists of their livelihood.
You can always debate pedantic assumptions - but that&#39;s stealing.
And you can repeat it all you want, it won&#39;t become true.
It is copyright infringement.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty for violating copyright
Obviously you don&#39;t mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should get money for images used in school assignments, a near-perfect definition of what should constitute fair use, then I&#39;m happy to deprive them of that fictitious income.
Lesson #1 should be to show how if the kids themselves create anything and post it on their favorite social networks, they give up all intellectual property to the site under the terms and conditions they passed from a click.
Maybe if they share the headphones of their mp3 player with a friend on the school bus, they should be expelled for breaking the law in such a way.
Ah if we could export this resource that we are full of, the complainer who says that everything is bad....
If it&#39;s a PS deputy who says it, then we have to believe it.
I have 2 children and when they are old enough to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France pulls people down by continually assisting them.
I don&#39;t want my children to bear the debt that this policy will have created.
What pulls France down are speeches like yours.
@gus I&#39;ve been in private business forever.
I had the LUCK to have worked in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I am an employee because I know that I don&#39;t have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to fire red balls at the bad bosses that I meet frequently.
At ease in my sneakers, I totally agree with Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan&#39;s post: he tells the horrible truth!
@gus, if we compare with the German companies that French business leaders constantly cite to ask for reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between the large companies and medium and small - What are French bosses waiting for to do the same??
That the state hold their hand?
This state they accuse of incompetence?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-entrepreneur couplet from you!
Remind me, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be so severe?
@Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders who are unable to create jobs and who sulk and simper while waiting for permanent assistance from the State!
It&#39;s awful!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labor Code, employers&#39; charges, taxes, working 45 hours a week paid 35, and some, walking on eggshells, dare to demand lower wages if not their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the “negative” comments on this thread.
Which is ironic considering how people always complain about First Group.
From what I see from where I am, Last hasn&#39;t really been an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to stay afloat rather than transform.
That&#39;s not to say Scottish railways haven&#39;t improved since Last took over.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
We unfortunately do not have the power to do this, alas.
I tried to get them recently, but I couldn&#39;t.
But hey, Labor is going to get us out of trouble, isn&#39;t it...
It is an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
There is nothing stopping people in the UK from building a more moral business and taking part in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good in management, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and the criticism when First won the Virgin contract, only to have the decision finally overturned.
And there is more: MTR, a Hong Kong company won the contract to operate Crossrail for 8 years.
Well Labour, as they repeatedly told us during the referendum campaign, is all for pooling and sharing and believes that workers should all help each other across borders.
So we can assume that they will be happy with this decision ;)
This may be because the management of the Dutch is on the right track while that of the British is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but above all new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
&quot;She was a fighter girl&quot;.
Lord, I hate, really I hate that kind of expression.
Supposing that the fact of being &quot;beater&quot; is a quality superior to many others, concern for others, intelligence, listening, for example, the fact of being &quot;beater&quot; has nothing to do with to do with that of surviving an illness: cancer patients who are &quot;beaters&quot;, who are nonetheless dead, I know of a number of them.
Coming out of an illness has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, let&#39;s start again..
I&#39;m not telling you it&#39;s THE condition to manage, I&#39;m telling you it HELPS..
Nothing to do with any merit...!
When the examples of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I start again.
To insinuate, even for a moment, that one can have merit in recovering from an illness or that one can demerit in not recovering from it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that lets go, everywhere, despite the will, despite the confidence in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
I&#39;m sorry to think otherwise, though, having strong morale probably makes it easier to accept heavy treatment and to prepare for it, to try experimental treatments like this woman did and not refuse them out of fear. .
Someone who is a fighter in medicine is above all someone who trusts medicine..
But if we prefer to rely on the &quot;lord&quot; it&#39;s something else..
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are peculiar to moralists.
When you catch a piece of dirt, a real one, you get robbed to the point of becoming just a zombie.
Personally I caught two, dirt, big, and if I &quot;fought&quot; as these fine psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight is all about gritting your teeth, suffering hell and taking the hits.
I thought the accusation against Milosevic was decided and finalized about ten years ago.
I haven&#39;t seen that name in the papers for at least that time.
What is happening ?
It&#39;s a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted “quickly” and then swept under the rug.
Is this the story that was told at the time?
The communist-turned-nationalist who started three Balkan wars in the past decade?
The communist president of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please question what has been deliberately left out: 1.
How could NATO bombing be legal under ANY rule of international law?
Which country did Serbia attack?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don&#39;t you mention that NATO destroyed this same building killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, he would be swallowed up by the western steamroller.
Westerners used a smokescreen to detach part of a sovereign state which then unilaterally declared independence and was swiftly recognized by western states who then lied throughout about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term because he failed to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in politics at the time.
Ultimately, the Guardian shouldn&#39;t call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we didn&#39;t like him).
To my knowledge, only in Greece does a method of predicting earthquakes roughly work, by measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
This type of study is undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results with us.
So there is hope, but caution is in order This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus, which would be &quot;the most smallest and coldest to have detectable water molecules,” according to a study conducted by the team of Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine from the University of Maryland.
Method to follow.
Just like those involving animals sensing a threat coming.
Thank you Passeur de sciences for often delighting us with these experimental feats that are carried out in the world.
How would the animals know (in advance)?
Undoubtedly by the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon for example.
A gas a priori odorless for humans but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments at his disposal.
However, we have no reliable results on these tracks…
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that certain animals act strangely for a few hours with an earthquake, in particular chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen a report on arte recounting the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to have the validity of their work recognized, which focused on the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and more particularly to their modification before an earthquake.
So of course I&#39;m not a scientist but their hypotheses had convinced me!
Where are we on this research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should relearn how to listen to nature...
If you examine things calmly and rigorously, you publish it in a serious journal, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the &quot;signs&quot; given by animals, we come up against the same bias: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake, the goldfish went oddly in circles.
I don&#39;t understand how anyone would think that Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He has done too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program you can&#39;t help but think that this man doesn&#39;t know anything about it and that he is always trying to distract him with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He couldn&#39;t name a single point.
He made so many promises to get elected as mayor and he didn&#39;t keep a single one.
That just underscores how much the rest of the Conservative Party is a bunch of crap, doesn&#39;t it?
Because he&#39;s popular.
Because he&#39;s funny.
He was in &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot;.
Because he&#39;s a celebrity and people have been instilled in the worship of celebrities.
Londoners voted for him and so will the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes over, the Tories&#39; popularity ratings will go through the roof, I&#39;m sure.
May God help us.
I&#39;m not so sure: people like jokes, but don&#39;t want their Prime Minister to be one
That&#39;s exactly what they used to say about Londoners.
He should have brought with him his friend the cinder block, smarter than him
In many ways I think he&#39;s trying to copy R Branson
The Americans had one as President.
The French are really and always disinterested in the history of the Pacific war.
For all those who have taken the trouble to read a few books (there are some, including an excellent French one by B.
Millot), the &quot;Solomons&quot; and the &quot;scrap strait&quot; speak, unfortunately as much as the dead who remained there.
We understand that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, the Australia, must always be there at the bottom since the battle of Savo) do not want to go back there.
We actually passed in front of the island of Savo, in the “Iron Bottom Sound”.
Even if the mission is coming to an end.
It&#39;s good little ones.
But the green side is a total smoke.
Calculate the kerozene consumed to reach the goal totally discredits the concept..
Just browse the list of sponsors Que des philanthropistes.
One more com operation neither done nor to be done.
Damn, that&#39;s so tempting!!!
I can&#39;t wait for the web series!
Your story makes me dream, identifying myself a little in passing (I also learned to sail with the Crocos de L&#39;Elorn at the Moulin Blanc in the harbor of Brest!).
Hats off also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of the move.
The end justifies the means.
Continue to make us dream, and to show with pride that the Bretons are great travellers!
Pierre, from Trinidad and Tobago.
Good evening I think the red cap who demonstrated against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local communities and public organizations of all kinds should not devote a penny of our taxes to financing the dreams of even a few adventurers as nice as these!
Are there any players in the current Serbian squad who are of Kosovo origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic at Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly at Juventus and now at Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don&#39;t know if they are still in the team
It&#39;s Bisevac the Lyon defender, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was a midfielder or forward in the 70s and 80s and coached many teams in Greece, but I don&#39;t know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as a striker in the great Velez team which, under the tutelage of legendary Suleman Rebac, twice finished second in the Yugoslav league (and also had big names like Vahid Halilhodzic and Arsène Wenger&#39;s loyal teammate, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
They said he was going to be a great player when he was at Juve, he&#39;s currently in Turkey, but last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn *shudder*
There, I can&#39;t help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to Fener and as far as I know he is not a starter there.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don&#39;t be afraid.
You should love Albania because you are neighbors.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of the real Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is a significant Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, in fact.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (that I know of).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Greater Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give parts of the country to neighboring countries.
How could one have felt &quot;an explosion of joy&quot; seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and probably children are inside?
How ???
What bothers me a little in this &quot;testimony&quot; is that the mere fact of having been able, if only once, to spontaneously rejoice at the horrible deaths of thousands of people, testifies in my eyes of a &quot;border line&quot; personality whose &quot;testimonies&quot; should be taken with the greatest circumspection.
No doubt that in the short moment of &quot;joy&quot;, we will not have thought of the dead nor of the reality of the horror inflicted.
We will have just thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had succeeded in really and apocalyptically hurting the big bad Satan in his very heart.
To do something powerful.
Grandiose.
It would seem that this feeling was shared by thousands of Muslims consumed by their feeling of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfreude.
We kinda suspected that.
The &quot;Christian/white/Gallic&quot; West cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when he contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of the Arab Muslim world today.
I&#39;m talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
Past splendour, certainly magnified, is no consolation, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this diabolical funnel?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigate the Arab world: the bigoted conservatism of the powers in place and fascistic nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
That we have understood it before, should not make the Muslims back down.
It&#39;s the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose that is true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the start of six long, dark, damp and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Plus, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I suffer from it myself.
When the light goes out, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little with mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The countryside in particular is breathtaking in autumn.
Not as breathtaking as the green of summer when everything is alive instead of dying.
In Britain, if you&#39;re lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We had a great summer this year, don&#39;t be grumpy who drools clichés!
Not everybody.
I rarely get sick in winter.
But now I&#39;m retired and no longer develop any immunity to outside germs, that may change I suppose.
It&#39;s not being about to die, it&#39;s just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a excitement that culminates in festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risk of snowfall and many other wonderful words.
Just don&#39;t stop doing things!
Here are my holiday recommendations for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months do indeed make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of increases for children, it is the amount collected by the State which comes mainly from deciles 8 to 10.
But as regards the number of households having seen their tax increase following this measure , it is mainly deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned ( median incomes ) according to graph 2 .
The abolition of the half share concerning especially widows is not treated at all in the article or rather its impact is completely underestimated: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And it&#39;s not ready to work out.
Well, we are not on the straw of course, but pensive
For once the PS has a rather left-wing policy, we&#39;re not going to cry...
It is obvious that those who are part of the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Keep it up and you&#39;ll encourage that 20% to work less or leave.
Well, I know that&#39;s not politically correct, but I&#39;m saying it anyway.
Long live the Trots and the OCI recycled at the PS: they have understood everything.
Adam, you can&#39;t see what you&#39;re looking at.
The proportion is always the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population holds 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from collecting as much as they can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money has passed, money only serves to make money, that is to say to bring misfortune on the greatest number.
We are among the richest 20%.
No doubt also the 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth, part of which is logically redistributed).
A fair tax should allow these households to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or else you might as well give up and live on social minima, especially if you have social housing.
The utopias of the Khmer Rouge-style head-cutters have fortunately come to an end.
I did two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two we got things we wouldn&#39;t get in a 5 star hotel and we didn&#39;t have to check in at the front desk or deal with any hassle.
Just go to someone&#39;s place, sleep there, tidy up and go.
From now on it will be my first option when I am traveling.
The logo has changed, the people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases you will need some form of homeowner&#39;s insurance.
Make sure you&#39;re using a service with the right logo!
Ah, 6 am too late.
I love Airbnb.
“It&#39;s very dangerous and highly risky” No it&#39;s not true.
You were just really unlucky.
From the link provided in the article:
To his credit, Airbnb&#39;s response to Teman was quick, almost absurdly quick.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had dispatched a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel, and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he received no support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as well as to travel
Hello I am looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I&#39;m considering paying a deposit and a month&#39;s rent all at once but I&#39;m a little worried about sending £1600 to a site I&#39;ve never really heard of.
But where are we going?
&quot;Support the troops&quot;, sang the Bu$herie in all tones...
Harmless weapons.
I&#39;m sure it will please the families and loved ones of the thousands of Kurds who died in halabja to learn that their relatives and friends succumbed to something other than saddam hussein&#39;s chemical bombardments.
Unless the content of the article has been radically edited by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to be polite).
Moreover, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still usable?
It&#39;s not very clear the style of the author: “in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We totally agree.
You think it&#39;s time to weaken the army to strengthen education
Now is never the time to strengthen education, because we are always at war.
Alternative: Is it ALWAYS time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
We would already greatly strengthen education if we made “them” work 35 hours instead of 17.
By the hour, our teachers currently earn more than engineers.
And don&#39;t make us believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their curriculum.
But it doesn&#39;t show since the National Education does not have the means to provide an office in the college/high school for its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework in short, except that the employer does not pay for the computer, the internet connection, or the supplies.
Besides, it&#39;s such a hideout at 5 p.m. a week and 4 months of vacation that we can&#39;t fill the CAPES with maths, come, we&#39;re waiting for you.
What do you mean you don&#39;t want to deal with poorly educated bastards whose parents spit on you calling you a wanker?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadis so that the Khurdish population can flourish better.
Where we see that the Bush administration has done absolutely everything wrong.
My first graduate job was in sales, in London, earning next to nothing and yet it was a job for which you needed a diploma.
A year later I saw an advert for being a London Underground worker, it was £5,000 extra a year and you didn&#39;t even ask for the patent.
I have never regretted.
On that note, don&#39;t worry if you can&#39;t find a graduate job, try to find something that either pays well or that you enjoy doing.
If I had stayed with graduate jobs, I would still be paying my student loan.
I don&#39;t really like corporate work, so I hope eventually to move into either the civil service or academia.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a three-year backlog.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Get rid of career paths such as art / literature / theater / media / philosophy / political science, ie what are called the diplomas of the unemployed.
I have one of these diplomas and I ended up production manager.
It turned out that the important thing was not the diploma but, as the article above says, a good career path, starting at school and continuing through university.
Admittedly, the starting salary was lower, but you quickly climb the ladder because in the real world what counts is results more than knowledge.
This debate between engineering studies and artistic courses has been going on for years.
Scientists can&#39;t solve all problems, it&#39;s more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time and interact with people in a way that gets results.
Letters, philosophy and art are career paths?
It&#39;s ridiculous.
I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re talking about degrees like media studies or whatever arcane stream you&#39;ve gone to.
Literature, philosophy, political science and art are real courses.
We need people who can explain the big issues to high school students, who understand the importance of the basics of culture like literature, art, etc., and value them.
Wouldn&#39;t it be better to have a real territorial policy to unclog Paris and energize the rest of France?
Personally, I find it hard to see the inhabitants of the depths of Essonne and Val-d&#39;Oise cycling 80km round trip every day to come to work in Paris.
Inhabitants of the inner city and the inner ring road already have many much more practical means of public transport (metro, bus, tram).
&gt; Several secure and locked car parks, as already exist in cities in northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the roads.
Good idea.
On the surface, space is cannibalized by PTWs.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris works with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
You might as well benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we couldn&#39;t find a place for ONE bicycle hitch.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë….
Alright, it&#39;s not okay at all.
When we talk to pedestrians and other public transport users about the reasons why they don&#39;t pedal, it seems to me that the main reasons that stand out are: 1/ it&#39;s very dangerous with all these cars, these trucks, these scooters ride super fast and don&#39;t give a damn about the survival of bicycles 2/ we get a lot of pollution in our heads For me, cycle paths are the last resort, we have to reduce car traffic (urban toll type congestion charge), reduce speed ( Paris = zone 30), enforce the highway code by systematically verbalizing (even bicycles with the downside that it is necessary to adapt the highway code written for cars 100 years ago to bicycles), generalize buffer zones after the zebra crossings, not before otherwise cars and scooters don&#39;t get in the way.
Bike paths are apartheid, you have to live together but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in greater Paris?
Not a word on the place of the bicycle in public transport?
ELV is right.
The goal of 15% bicycle trips is ridiculous.
I&#39;m beginning to believe Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in flour.
Moreover, according to what OR reports, the EELV deputies seem skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racketeering begins, it would be better to find out who is really behind this massacre.
Hint: it&#39;s not Russia.
Not sure I like the way the world is changing.
It looks awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer has expressed his intention to take the case to the ECHR, but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been filed.
Moreover, they would have to lodge a complaint first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be deferred pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and subsequent criminal investigation.
Yeah but Libya didn&#39;t blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not at fault, the fault lies with the authority in charge of airspace security, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident foreseeable?
Other planes had been shot down previously, Ukraine was launching air attacks against the rebels in the area, and any plane could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Did the Ukrainian government take reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or did it choose to gamble with the lives of innocent people so that the airlines pay the rights to fly over the territory?
Where are all the pro-kyiv trolls defending their usurping government / West Ukrainian ultranationalists - and wanting to basically demonstrate that Putin shot down MH17.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kyiv government because they are responsible for what happens in their skies.
The precedent: a 1986 ruling by the International Court of Justice that found that the CIA&#39;s supply of weapons to rebel Contra forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
No way Russia will let this case go to the ICJ.
It&#39;s funny to think that Abbott wants to tell Putin that Australians have been murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can present evidence to back up his claims.
So far investigators have said no such thing.
To be called Ricardo and to be such a stupid in eco, it&#39;s distressing!
To be called Polaire is to lose the north is delightful.
Just one stupid question: are today&#39;s poor poorer than yesterday&#39;s poor?
I can&#39;t help noticing that those who most virulently criticize Piketty&#39;s book haven&#39;t read it!
It&#39;s easy to read, it took me a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of labor income, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that the concentration of capital today joins that of the beginning of the 20th century before 1914, it shows that it is the 2 world wars which reduced the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, then how concentration resumes After...
Bernajuzan: what are you saying no to?
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that the capacity of concentration of an individual has some limits.
Then the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is correct, one can debate it without having read the book, the essence of which consists in arguing in one direction in favor of it.
No, it&#39;s easy to read...
Bernajuzan: how long did you take to read it?
Is the central thesis of his pad summed up by the press wrong?
I have not read and will not read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis and it is this one that strikes me as pure hoax.
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Isn&#39;t humanity globally enriched?
And this enrichment added to an increase in population is the real political question today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and definitely deserves the award.
But remember, she&#39;s only 17.
An age when most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope this award will not be a burden for the girl and she will find her way to a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colored perverts are the embodiment of evil.
All my best wishes to Malala, but she needs to realize that she is being used and nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or anywhere else – not even in working-class areas of Britain!
Did anyone think his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she wasn&#39;t where she is now, she would have been married off at 14.
Isn&#39;t Malala herself one of those &quot;colored perverts&quot;?
You should have no &quot;airtime&quot; on this site.
You are, yourself, a horrible pervert.
It is absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn&#39;t going to marry her off at 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
Her father runs a school where girls are educated and he is in favor of equal rights for women.
It is, and always has been, for her to receive a higher education and to have the right to decide on her own marriage.
However, he is unusual in Pakistan, as he thinks women are equal to men.
What she was saying was that an average Pakistani girl often has to get married at 14, without having a say.
Sorry she didn&#39;t state it eloquently enough for you.
It may sound contradictory, but maybe she means that, if her father hadn&#39;t given her freedom, she would have been married off at 14.
Rather disappointed by this introduction to season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who obviously has a little trouble finding her Marlene Dietrich look-alike character.
I just watched the last two seasons which are quite different but I must admit that it is one of the best horror series, one of the most accomplished!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to perfection and the show of Jessica Lange singing Bowie&#39;s anachronistic Life on Mars is simply stunning.
I haven&#39;t watched this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange blah blah).
In the case of American Horror Story, I&#39;d rather have all of a sudden than watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is certain, apart from the extraordinary Jessica Lange, it is above all the risks of staging and editing that amaze me.
We have in AHS an avalanche of original plans which quite ridicules the sanitization of today&#39;s productions.
It escapes me a little to see you throwing in the towel in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say it so well, there are many other things as well.
No it&#39;s quite simply that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her voice and the way she uses it) is really ONE of the pillars of the series apart from the technical qualities.
And good bah I watch a lot for her.
Then I find that the series sins by writing, it wants to do too many things at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don&#39;t see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it&#39;s going to end up like 24 hours.
But hey, everyone does what they want, huh!
It&#39;s because I say &quot;I won&#39;t watch anymore&quot; that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I simply share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think it will be fatal.
But then again, that&#39;s just my opinion.
Let&#39;s talk less about tax increases, please - let&#39;s cut government spending instead.
No, let&#39;s increase the spending please.
Those who wanted to cut spending failed.
Trigger controversies over relatively small spending items, such as development aid
The problem is that this is less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is, we&#39;re all talking about nuances rather than the change in direction that voters seem to be calling for, and all the while some on every side are pretending those nuances are far more important. and substantial than they are - and voters see through their game and find them to be in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenses.
“Debt” is assets held primarily by financial institutions in that country.
“Debt” is nothing to worry about.
I would have no problem with the government appropriating a third of my income (before even talking about consumption taxes) if I thought they were going to put it to good use.
But that&#39;s not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
They say Nigel Farage wasn&#39;t quite honest about cutting taxes but hey, if you add up our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, wind turbine subsidies roughly useless and nuclear power stations costing double what they should, you arrive at a figure that makes the Labor and Lib-Dem tax on the most luxurious residences look ridiculous.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means someone earning £35,000 a year will pay around £5,000 (one-seventh of their salary), someone on £50,000 would pay around £10,000 (one-fifth), etc. and someone with £200,000 pays around £70,000 (just over a third).
What about social security contributions?
Plus social security contributions, plus local taxes, plus parking fees and the car vignette, and that&#39;s before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is deducted at source before local taxes and car tax.
I get paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it&#39;s a problem, of course, I&#39;m happy to pay my taxes.
But let&#39;s not pretend that money is falling from the sky, or that it doesn&#39;t matter where billions of pounds in tax go.
How can an unemployed person looking for work door to door prove this?
Even if 20% of the unemployed would not look, that means that 80% look and do not find.
Being unemployed myself, do I have more interest in what others are looking for or not?
Whether a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CVs increases my chances accordingly.
Indeed I haven&#39;t heard from Pôle Emploi for months, does that mean that the agents are more busy with control operations than really bringing in job advertisements?
I do not see the interest.
Because it is not up to the state to provide work.
If Pole Emploi does not provide enough positions, then Pole Emploi must be dispensed with.
How is this a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we make sure that the unemployed fulfill their duties in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks the users of a means of transport for their transport ticket, a department head or the employees of their work, etc.
No one cries foul in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I dealt with Pôle Emploi, my rights at the ARE had been badly established, and on one of the files, amputated by 40% , we had to fight hard.
That takes time !
I am not a legal expert.
Filing and control currently takes over, while statutorily Pôle Emploi is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern employees, they are the ones who pay the contributions.
Politicians and non-salaried French people grant themselves rights that they do not actually have!
It is not normal.
I would add that a dignified unemployment insurance participates in the valuation of salaried work.
More than waiting for murderous tweets in Arabic...
In reality there needs to be a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the Black Death in 1348/9 in connection with the war and the displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the presence of mind to ban Hajj in Mecca this year for Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 had their visa applications refused because of their country of origin or their recent travels.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox in Mecca during the Hajj in the 1980s, probably infected by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it heartless to offer to prevent Ebola patients from flying to Europe?
I thought it was just common sense but apparently those &quot;in the know&quot; decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be under strict quarantine.
Nobody comes out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract Ebola while they are there, they stay there until they are cured.
These are not drastic measures.
In the past week alone, people have been infected after having contact with people in West Africa despite taking &quot;all necessary precautions&quot;.
We can stop the progress of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
Let&#39;s forbid them to offer to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms, so that they can be quarantined immediately.
If he manages to convey the message of the individual first and of the group (including religious) second, he will have deserved the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he is able to set up as dogma the image of God characterized by the total of the cortices of the planet in operation.
It is still far from this conception there.
It&#39;s only been 20 years since information emerged as humanity&#39;s given bounty, while religion, spun off from the cerebellum, has been directing our actions since perhaps Lucy.
What&#39;s the point of becoming yet another Protestant church?
For those who haven&#39;t noticed, Catholicism is largely in the minority in France today, no one is forced to adhere to it.
Those who criticize would not set foot in the Church anyway, just look at the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, which is too &quot;anxiogenic&quot;?
@louise: Sorry the church does not have a vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe it will reach more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) respect for others as you envision it existed before christ.
Hillel a century before him already said: &quot;do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you, that is the whole Torah and the rest is only commentary: go and study!&quot;.
Christianity goes far beyond simple reciprocity but introduces agape.
Your &quot;advancing justice, peace, brotherhood&quot; but without god?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Next step: we remove the incarnation and the resurrection.
Jesus will remain this hero who overturned moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace and fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I seem to remember that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly explained by the fact that their ancestors were exterminated then converted by force and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I&#39;m hesitating too much between buying this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
You can not make that up.
Me personally I would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even took part in its fundraising campaign) but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth £30.
If it&#39;s the PC version you&#39;re interested in, Green Man Gaming is currently selling SoM for £30 and also offering a 20% off voucher.
Green Man Gaming is currently selling SoM for £30 and also offering a 20% off voucher.
I will look.
Obviously not at work.
The killjoys of the IT department block all cool sites.
Hello, is it £30 then 20% off, or does the £30 include the 20% off?
Be careful though: the PC version is only for DX11.
it took me by surprise, i bought it, but can&#39;t play it.
Plus I bought it on Steam, so no refund sucks.
Time to buy a new video card *screams*
It&#39;s a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID I believe.
Caveat emptor and all that: I haven&#39;t used it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thanks, I&#39;m afraid one day they&#39;ll delete it from your library if they decide to crack down on people buying it there while they&#39;re out of the intended region.
So join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So, was France in 1940 a &quot;putrid compost&quot;?
Say, this Nobel Prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
You have to love the France of 40, that of &quot;the strange defeat&quot;?
When we see who gets the Nobel Literature we wonder if Proust or Dostoyevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even an event, we don&#39;t even want to read the award-winning authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians will read Modiano which is already difficult to read in French and which describes a universe so limited and so egocentric?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don&#39;t worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano at its fair value, if they don&#39;t already know it!
For your part, continue to frequent Lévy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep all their chances.
So let&#39;s see who won the Nobel Literature: H.

Hello freaks.
Ever since I drove one in Iceland, I keep seeing Kia Sportages everywhere.
I think this thing followed me here.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like the horrible computer in Superman III?
Hello Dantra, still hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It&#39;s Wednesday !
I had a few days off.
It was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham Beer and Cider Festival.
It was messy.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, it wasn&#39;t just CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with camera fanatics).
Driving on the return Sunday was really tough.
Monday night we went to a friend&#39;s grandfather to play nine card brag.
Thanks to some real beginner&#39;s luck I was able to walk away with several decent bets.
I hope that if I reach 95 I will be as lively as him.
Last night I went to a fancy cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came with a slice of bacon on it.
I admire Mr.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, without wanting to upset you, I think you&#39;re getting a bit off topic.
This famous totality, it prohibits the quests for the jihadists at the exit of the mosques.
She immediately reports arms trafficking.
Either we have our eyes wide open like Meddeb and Taïa or Boubaker or we have our eyes wide closed.
It&#39;s necessary to choose.
It is not by keeping your eyes closed that you reach the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you are making a monumental misinterpretation: all the authorities, organizations or representative associations, Muslim or not, having formally condemned IS and its crimes, the French, Muslims or not , have nothing to add to these unanimous official condemnations.
Who is silent consents.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like the French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc&#39;h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and to demand that they demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of French society that she is wrong to doubt it.
This principle is in my eyes the negation of the republic and can only contribute to disintegrating French society.
If there is no doubt, just say so.
Who does not say a word consents, but consents to what?
Consent to proximity to IS or condemnation of IS.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to spare the goat and the cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond has predicted that Scotland could, in the election, &#39;take revenge&#39; on the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has grown between their devolution proposals and what they promised on the eve of the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be petrified at the thought of losing all those seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be cracking up laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives don&#39;t give a damn about Scotland because they have no support there.
They can do whatever they want with electoral impunity.
I don&#39;t think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that Labor losing seats in Westminster to the SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Tories.
Who will shed a tear for the Labor Party.
They will be totally eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut off their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the &#39;PROMISE&#39; thinking he was saving his party but not realizing he was signing the death warrant for his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labor MPs are holding their leader to account.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they can force both the Conservatives and Labor to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that is rather the important thing.
Not if Labor or the Conservatives ever want to be re-elected in England.
To wax the pumps of 8% to the detriment of 85%, it is not a great electoral strategy.
Plus, once Scottish MPs can no longer vote on matters that concern England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I believe he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists and it worked out well for her.
Yet he is still in the running to be prime minister in 2015 and has been since winning the leadership of the Labor Party.
So basically these boxes will virtually be behind every reader to look over their shoulder and see what they&#39;re reading, how they&#39;re reading, and see the way through.
It&#39;s &quot;The Lives of Others&quot; of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of the FRIC...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
Ultimately, this will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I&#39;m waiting for the next post: Amazon manufactures YOUR book according to YOUR profile and that automatically thanks to a secret algorithm!
It&#39;s gay as a world.
Strongly stimulate.
Thanks for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I still have to read pirated files, books in the public domain or purchased from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without cookies.
Considering the price I paid for the Kobo, it&#39;s without regret.
I am amazed at the widespread abdication of users in the face of the widespread appropriation of their privacy.
At your general public bookstore, you will systematically notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, etc.).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose open and completion rates are arguably paltry.
For example “Finnegans Wake” by James Joyce.
@Thomas: In the era of Big Data, data doesn&#39;t really have to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all the literature in the same bin.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile….
The harvest is not anonymous.
These are the data published by Kobo which are, allowing neither to identify the readers, nor the authors.
But Kobo has all this information.
There have been so many exaggerated, misleading and contradictory statements from the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be run by a kindergarten class full of schizophrenic kids on acid.
It&#39;s even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan&#39;s religious fundamentalism.
It&#39;s interesting that some Erdogan supporters think Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Good point :-P But Turkey does not want to shoot itself in the foot, unless it gains something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will fight back, so it&#39;s effectively shooting itself in the foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog: &quot;The AP reports that Iran warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad because it would endanger the security of Israel.
It is not clear from the article whether Iran was sending a grave warning of retaliation or simply advising caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what really surprises is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic engagement concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region”.
Reading Indian Punchline is highly recommended for anyone who pays attention to the details rather than the c*nnery thrown around by mainstream media. The short article you link to is important and should be read bearing in mind the earlier realistic observations/warnings that came out of Iran about Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these “moderates” who seriously fight the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline politics is pushing the world into the abyss and I would suggest those who refer to nonexistent &quot;moderates&quot; pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending other people&#39;s children to fight in World War III.
“It&#39;s even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan&#39;s religious fundamentalism” Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in mind.
There should be a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
It should &quot; ?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have the slightest chance of being alive?
A little late for that, mate...
Wouldn&#39;t criminals be barely old now, like 120?
A little late for that, right?
Particularly regarding the CUP triumvirate that planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after WW1 in revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a remote central Asian location roughly at the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding a Turkish empire there.
What delirium!
An impressive mastery of the fallacy of the fatal slope, but apart from that, we look in vain for contact with reality.
What clichés without argument.
The fetus will still hear a beating heart even in the womb of a surrogate mother.
Lesbian couples may simply want children and not want to be accepted.
Infertile straight couples too.
As for the children!
What a shame to designate them as future psychological imbalances.
One day, they will be old enough to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their living and to pay the pension of this lady (?)
Surrogacy is undoubtedly a temporary &quot;solution&quot; in the evolution of medicine in our world.
It is not from today.
Many women have borne and given birth to children who were not their husband&#39;s.
It is still so, so we are made...
The important thing in this matter is that this practice be framed so that the &quot;commodification&quot; of the body is limited.
But aren&#39;t plastic surgery and cosmetics also the commodification of bodies? !
Anakronik Fareinheit ...
It is certainly more elegant to impregnate a maid in a distant country via the internet and Pay Pal than to take responsibility and or avoid scandal in another century close to home without shouting it at this time from the rooftops! ...
These practices were also not done in the name of the church! ...
It&#39;s not just Christians and believers who refuse these practices...
The fact remains that the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh shut up, this man is passionate about something.
In the late 70s in the Midlands I only saw this from afar.
I had to go there during the day because I was not allowed to go there at night!
But if you liked it and you listen to the music - this music today still touches you as much.
I don&#39;t know why there are so many disparaging comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they are posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I believe that in the sports section there is an article on football waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson&#39;s film, there has been a dearth of reporting that truly reflects the reality of Northern England culture.
It is not surprising that Paul Mason understood the social and political context well, he understands things well.
Northern soul still lives, but it has been vampirized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can check it out if you&#39;re in the London area in November: 99psoul will once again be playing soul vinyl, including plenty of Northern soul, on Saturday November 15th at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I too thought “always the same story”, but here is a well written and well thought out little article.
your criticisms really need to be more constructive.
Great article.
I loved your documentary.
Guess you&#39;re glad you escaped Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and get off at Wallgate.
By swallowing pills.
Whatever the station before Wigan was Ince, 15 mins walk from Wigan after buying a ticket for the stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the detective series George Gently entitled Gently Northern Soul, which takes place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is getting more and more poisonous.
The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahu does not seek peace since he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (by the way, this was also the case of Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their constituents all preferred occupation-settlement to peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock and went into the water.
An Israeli had stolen them.
The Israeli representative stood up angrily and shouted, &quot;What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren&#39;t even there at the time!&quot;
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its people have no faith in the bipolar Palestinian Authority government and will not let their guard down...
That this displeases the anti-Israelis is obvious, it is not the desired goal...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report...
And it is always so since Politics is globalized...
Avoidance, avoidance...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it continues!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What balance of power allowed the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still today a balance of power!
Do you doubt it?!!! ...
Besides, it&#39;s not all about Russell Brand, but the Guardian reporters seem to have a hard time getting past anything he doesn&#39;t have to say.
Much of what he says is pseudo-Chomskyist nonsense written by no one else.
This proves that you don&#39;t understand what Russell Brand is saying, or what Noam Chomsky is saying.
It&#39;s just a series of personal attacks and innuendo (my 13 year old daughter likes it, which would mean it&#39;s immaturity).
A truly vicious loadout, with just a hint of awareness that Russell Brand is speaking certain truths, perhaps truths we&#39;d rather not think about.
Hang on, this feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand pisses some people off: he sometimes talks smug and after all the tabloid nonsense he does sound like a rookie populist, but the whole thing about not voting has been completely misinterpreted according to Me.
The general consensus seems to be that he&#39;s just telling people not to vote and instead just sit back and ignore the whole political process - but if you watch the Paxman interview and other articles/videos he posted he says voting once every 5 years just for Labor or the Conservatives (or the Lib Dems I guess) and limiting democratic engagement to that is completely unnecessary, both parties (to slightly different degrees) governing primarily in favor of special interests, multinational corporations and the wealthy, At no time does he say to just completely ignore politics because these parties do not govern on our behalf: he insists that rather than just voting and go offline for five years, people should become a lot more politically active at the local level, organize movements, protests, petitions, whatever and try to influence politics from that.
I&#39;m not saying that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think being politically active in making demands can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are weathervanes who will change their minds if they&#39;re really in danger of losing the election), but it&#39;s infuriating to see all these condescending responses that say this jesus-doing jerk is telling young people not to bother to vote and just hope for the best because that&#39;s really distorting his arguments.
His solution is extremely questionable and it would be nice if people debated what he actually said rather than just labeling him as irresponsible and putting aside the concerns of him and a vast amount of people being left behind.
Yes thanks.
The voting thing has been completely twisted.
The uselessness of slipping a ballot into a ballot box every 5 years deeply irritates me since my vote really does not count for anything.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and MPs who are accountable locally to their constituents.
Also, I take issue with the idea that Russell Brand&#39;s words are not his (written by others).
He&#39;s smart enough to have his own words and ideas, even if these are heavily influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counterculture that Suzanne would like to label as &quot;pseudo-dumb nonsense.&quot; Chomskyites”.
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that&#39;s what the Guardian could do, having Suzanne do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the nods added to the edit!
Like Max Keizer, who at first attacked Russel but ended up becoming a fan of his and inviting him on his show, it&#39;s too easy to attack him without really understanding where he&#39;s coming from.
It taps into a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been sidelined by mainstream media - including the Guardian - for generations.
This &quot;rebellion&quot; reveals above all to me that the intellectual debate has long ceased to take place at the RDV de l&#39;Histoire where professional historians have become a minority and where exchanges of specialists have been impoverished in favor of ready-to-think Sciences Po type digests for press kits.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to attack a culprit, a scapegoat.
They both develop very rational reasoning, but this rationality rests on these scapegoats which are the keystone of their thinking.
I rather believe that for Foucault the state was indispensable as culprit.
This comes from a very archaic way of thinking, sacrificial thinking, which is also magical thinking.
We solve the problem of the relationship to the other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist, neo-lib and/or /libertarian slope (of the two terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing how to seek help from the state for its markets) sense of less state / no state at all in Foucault.
The old dream of the base which self-organizes beautifully.
His thought is built on the guilt of the State: without this guilt it does not stand up.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a statement against the three intellectuals quoted here.
Or support for that matter.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of its then god, Stalin, the little father of the people.
Oulala, you probably read a little too quickly if you took Foucault&#39;s texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology for Khomeini.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel in this way...
Gauchet poses a profound reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty represented by the membership mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.
To see this cabal orchestrated by hard-left social scientists who can&#39;t stand being without allegiance to their mantras is quite laughable.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these &quot;rebels&quot;, which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chinese and other scabs I witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn&#39;t have the pleasure of hearing from our Australian friends on this subject, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don&#39;t remember when I last saw a Chinese.
In London and they were nice to me when they found out I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same of the Whites!
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them saying violently anti-white things.
My father is not happy that his eldest daughter is dating a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are getting richer, prosperity is spreading outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people are traveling abroad. stranger and see how other people live.
From what I have been told, Russians are especially prejudiced against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited. by their employers or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Yenisei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard the opinions of Australians on the Chinese and the Aborigines.
It&#39;s really weird that a foreigner tells me that I can&#39;t stand the Chinese, when I&#39;ve met two in my life (one of them abroad), haven&#39;t had bad memories of them, all people are equal and, in fact, those in London have been very nice that&#39;s the only reason I remembered that they were Chinese.
Otherwise we do not remember who we meet, all people are equal, how to remember who was who.
You know what&#39;s weird?
That you and the other Russian here talk about the Chinese as some sort of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you&#39;re still dating said white guy.
How many Chinese men are with white women, by comparison?
None, because there is a good chance that the parents of these white women would PHYSICALLY attack them.
No measure of the impartiality of justice.
However, it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left like the magistrates&#39; union...
@Marabout: sorry, but the judicial circles are frankly branded right.
As for the Syndicate of the judiciary, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its partiality can be made from the relativity of the application of the laws in the courts, it requires removing two obstacles.
That of the political vision of the observer like that of the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
It therefore remains the tool required by law to refocus the evaluation on the fundamentals.
The extent of its non-observance in all the judicial acts of magistrates, including the prosecution, forces us to make a distinction between the error and the partiality of the magistrates.
It would be vain to claim that the acts of justice are not divided between these three groups.
The pretense and the lack of knowledge do not come under an objective analysis.
And if all this is not analyzed, how then can we say that justice is improving in France?
If only by statistics implicitly revealing that it is starting from a very low base.
The preceding preamble makes it possible to properly register what follows in the third ratio.
That of the corruption* of the judiciary.
Sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The field considered is that of the spoliation* of heirs committed even by means of procedural fraud* by inheritance genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession obtains year after year 150 million euros while benefiting from the cover* provided by the quasi-judicial impunity* of the French notariat.
For the understanding of their mechanism, part of it has been reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this joins the said statistical improvement* moderated by the previous comment, it is that the judicial institution has produced, during numerous disputes between genealogists and heirs reluctant to be despoiled in this way, a whole set of case law contrary to all laws favorable to heirs.
Isn&#39;t the presentation of European statistics ignoring this kind of rational criteria then an elaborate form of lying?
Surely totally prohibitive prices.
More material to rip off the disabled.
You can say that, but my brother has one of those off-road trikes, custom built to his height and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like a normal wheelchair never did, with bulky wheels and tires, could not.
As they say, tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson might invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks EPIC.
I don&#39;t think the inventor of the Whill ever had to clean dog poop off a caterpillar.
I&#39;m sure my sister would love the off-road tricycle, but it&#39;s just too expensive.
The ultra long distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a penchant for longboarding.
Here there are hills that would please them.
The prices do seem high, but there really are people who put that kind of price on a bike, so “you see”.
The all-terrain tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
Not all disabled people are poor, however.
Many of them have reasonable amount of insurance available to them.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is, the wheelchair market is a niche market, so they can afford to charge high prices for things they know we need.
You can&#39;t really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
unfortunately it&#39;s just a draft, it is not planned to be manufactured.
I&#39;m HAPPY the &quot;long distance&quot; wheelchair isn&#39;t coming to market, because apparently there&#39;s no way to drive the damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 houses have been destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza, during intensive shelling of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings are prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
The eight-year-olds have lived their whole lives under an Israeli blockade!
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation, an illegal situation too, since this blockade inflicts a &quot;collective penalty&quot; on all the civilians of Gaza.
&quot;Entrepreneurs working on their projects divert a little bit of their cement to the black market&quot;...
Ah that&#39;s not wooden language, rather concrete and armed the lady...
References are there to support an argument or a fact.
Anti-Zionist...
Good cement goes in the tunnels!
There is the black market for sure, and recognized.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and moral sense.
The USA has a well-guarded ground: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi didn&#39;t have enough time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by who you know) excluded him!
Don&#39;t forget also that after having lifted it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I am a Westerner, so I approve...
John...
The Blockade is Israeli-Egyptian ...
The children of Gaza live in an underground fortress, built upside down by the people who have chosen their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you have thought well.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the sharing economy, not for profit.
Many are just looking for a one-night stand on Couchsurfing.
So it&#39;s getting paid (or at least hoping for it) in some other way.
It&#39;s always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
Additionally, landlords and renters who trust each other often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, bypassing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all this.
&quot;That she rents out&quot;?
No problem with the verb, what is the problem with your grammar?
We don&#39;t use the verb “to let” in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It&#39;s an international newspaper now, in case you haven&#39;t noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% compliant with all safety regulations and ask those who manage canals and rivers for permission to carry out commercial activity on it (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and repainted, sunk, etc. ?
Houseboats are so slow that if someone tried to steal it, it would still be close to where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates...
all these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our barges…
Where are you going to moor it?
No Marine Le Pen is not right!
Populism?
There is no truth other than that which exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase of wealth in the hands of the wealthiest is a reality.
Who is defending whom?
Who defends what?
In 2017 the mass will be said!
Capitalism will not get poorer!
High finance, speculates, plays with our companies therefore our jobs, with our raw materials, therefore our purchases, our foodstuffs therefore our food, with the healthcare structures therefore our health, with our debts therefore our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold..
All this for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obese money.
Until proven otherwise, FH said: &quot;my enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance&quot;.
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former Rothschild bank minister for the economy, to better defend the interests of the banksters, who were solely responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there no one else competent?
What do you call that: turn your jacket over, drop your pants?
Primary and populist reaction
In fact, we don&#39;t really know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to help the survivors.
I&#39;m not sure that Spee really &quot;refused&quot; to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that neither side seemed sure of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book &quot;Castles of Steel&quot; suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was rough at the start of the day; I don&#39;t know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Likewise, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Contrast that with the next battle, that of the Falklands, where photos showing survivors being rescued show calm seas in broad daylight.
Moreover, the rescuers knew that at this point there were no more German fighters in the area.
Hmm, that doesn&#39;t quite match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
“There was some confusion among the German ships as to the fate of the two armored cruisers, which had disappeared into the dark after ceasing firing, and a chase began.
The Leipzig saw something on fire, but as he got closer he saw that it was just wreckage.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, bowed and badly damaged but still moving.
After aiming his searchlight at the ship&#39;s flag, the offer to surrender was refused and he opened fire, eventually sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee judged that the Good Hope must have escaped and stopped the search at 10:15 p.m.
Worried by reports of a British battleship in the vicinity, he steered north.”
So if this is true, the Germans, groping in the dark before the invention of radar, did not know a ship had sunk, and therefore could not search for survivors.
They also thought there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area which could have damaged them badly, so in the confusion they bolted to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they would have to fight their way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock&#39;s sacrifice had already harmed them and cost them about half their ammunition, thus dooming them when they were finally caught.
Several voices are raised at the UMP to demand that it be enshrined in law that an elected official who has been definitively condemned is therefore definitively ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect elected leftists of course.
But nooo, it&#39;s a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSE AN INSCRIPTION ON THE WALL OF THE CONS OF THE MAGISTRATES
When will trade unions be banned in already protected sectors?
How long will we tolerate this distortion of equality between citizens?
Maintained by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to appease those who will take advantage of their tenure to hinder the actions of real politicians, who are really trying to make things happen, not the beautiful talkers whose immobility is commensurate with their smugness.
I met them in the metro around noon with their little signs &quot;coins for justice&quot; they came from the provinces and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
She supports the existence of politicized unions whose members put the enormous power they hold at the service of her party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing or even far-right unions targeted personalities on its side and waged a legal and media war against them.
Your affirmations are totally free.
If, currently the line pays the legal news it is simply that it committed acts which concern it!
We don&#39;t have an example of a left-wing personality who has had so much to do with justice, but not everyone who has been the subject of his attention has had preferential treatment.
On the other hand, it should be remembered that the union of the judiciary which is on the left is not the only union of magistrates and that it is a minority.
That a minister so strongly supports the trade unions shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you quote may be in the minority among magistrates, but its influence is great in the Chancellery, it&#39;s no secret.
We now wonder if the &quot;mission&quot; of certain judges is not more to smear than to instruct.
@gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is in the minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: you forget that magistrates are not civil servants like the others: they are the only ones with the power to impeach and incarcerate everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever returned?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I believe even the most fame-hungry moron realizes that X-Factor can only spell the end of a career, so I&#39;d be surprised if anyone took up the offer.
Many have used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
One Direction fill stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or left for the West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is on the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Celine Dion, Cliff Richard, all made the Eurovision Song Contest, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and all the rest have entered competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 80s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of British television&#39;s light entertainment stars.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that&#39;s what happens to most stars who don&#39;t enter pageants anyway.
Rare are those who, after a tube, succeed in making others.
Anyway, most singers/groups can at best hope for three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, only has fans in the UK.
Her fame comes in part from her marriage to a mouth-breathing footballer.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it&#39;s more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock route, even if in your dreams you think all the guitar show-offs who smoke weed in their dad&#39;s garage and rock three chords on a grade school level poem will surely become stars and the only question is how much they want to earn before they even release an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that quickly turns into racism, because the sacralist ethnologists present these distant people to us as infinitely superstitious and steeped in ritual bigotry, whereas the most of their ways of doing things are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, by practical day-to-day considerations.
Except that you recklessly interpret in the opposite direction.
Granted, but rather than saying that the drum has no sacred character, isn&#39;t it better to admit that our Mariannes and our Molières do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is reminded to see the sacred as a sort of well-defined object circumscribed to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article anyway.
It&#39;s ephemeral decoration to fill the void.
Nothing more.
Superb article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of the sacred still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw away unscientific interpretations that last the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When will there be a comparative critique of disciplines so that we can laugh a little?
Because what is valid for archeology is also valid for the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a healthy dose of modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, precious testimonies for reconstructing history, understanding societies, and the example here of comparative archeology is fascinating.
This method is not very old and previously archaeologists relied on their &quot;instinct&quot; and their knowledge, and could be wrong.
Nowadays we have such high-performance technical and scientific means that the interpretation of excavations is better but can always be called into question by other discoveries!
We are here in the midst of the (and old) controversy over shamanism put forward by the prehistorian Jean Clottes (see his book &quot;Les chamanes de la préhistoire&quot;, particularly the re-edition augmented with the scientific controversy, published by La Maison des rocks).
Thank you for this very informative article.
Do straight men like anal sex?
For you Mike, I could get on it.
So it&#39;s over between us?
I don&#39;t really understand Why can&#39;t we continue at three?
This journal is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the gutter?
No, but we&#39;re not against a play on that.
We couldn&#39;t watch a musical on that though, that would be too gay!
We could expect to have this kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost over, may I suggest you switch to the Catholic Times.
I&#39;m sure you will feel more at home.
He prefers Mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real, brave journalists to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc.? at their own risk.
Rather than laughing with these childish ass jokes.
Not very smart.
Go away then.
If these &quot;childish ass jokes&quot; offend you so much, you don&#39;t have to participate, do you?
Do you also know that this journal also covers the Middle East and Ebola and it is totally possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh about it?
Nevertheless, there is amateur video of the crash on the net…
amateur video of the crash on the net…??
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images it is only to protect its interests and in no way those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the drivers, they would have pulled out the safety car when another vehicle (tow truck for example) entered the circuit.
But we had to finish quickly before the typhoon which we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not see fit to bring forward the time of departure (television rights, advertising, money, etc.).
But apart from that they protect the pilots well.
Well seen, I also share this opinion.
But there is also that if the very British FOM brings in the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance at the restart to beat the Englishman who was then leading...
You let go on this blog my dear Dayrton.
But it does not matter, I have a little time to flush out all your c*****ries.
No, just no.
There have been plenty of conspiracies in F1, but never one that puts stewards in mortal danger over some distant story of one driver&#39;s possibility of victory over another.
It is not the FOM which releases the safety because it is the FIA.
Size nuance.
In view of the amateur images, the absence of an image above all allows the FIA to avoid embarrassing questions such as: How is it that the marshal waves a green flag in the middle of the intervention and continues to do so after the accident? (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA is blocking the images of the accident but because we can clearly see one of the marshals waving a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that we are no longer under a yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark misunderstanding of F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under a yellow flag AFTER the place of the accident, hence the waved green flag.
This is the usual procedure.
The commissary post just downstream of the accident (depending on the case, it can be 10 meters or 100 meters after the accident) waves the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal pace.
Sensationalism sells advertising.
I used to think the media was part and parcel of the government&#39;s “patriotic” propaganda offensive, but I&#39;m afraid that, in the end, it&#39;s just for the money.
And sex, let&#39;s not forget sex, the fear of not having a sex life, advertising and the media are good for selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
News does exactly the same thing.
Buzzing around with stuff you really don&#39;t need to care about is just to keep scaring people so you can keep controlling them.
&#39;When the tabloids cough about Ebola, we all get scared&#39; It should be &#39;derail&#39;, not &#39;cough&#39;.
Given the medical reference, &quot;to cough&quot; is much better said in this context than &quot;to derail.&quot;
I wonder if all the people who are freaking out that Ebola might start spreading through the air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You do them too much honor.
They probably think this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the coming apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You are confusing Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article which nicely and solidly ridicules this abject pseudo-journalism.
It made me laugh a lot.
It depresses me that the media talks about most things with this upside-down optimism.
The point is again to keep us scared and anxious enough (without getting hysterical) that the government can get us out of control when it needs to.
I think it makes perfect sense that if we have to have a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises of its own making.
Isn&#39;t there something fundamentally wrong with the idea of ruling by fear?
Congratulations for this post, and for still being in this world almost 35 years later.
In addition, at the beginning it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s and 90s.
I&#39;m amazed, live with the certainty of spending years there.....
Totally useless evidence.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only are testimonials useless: taken in isolation, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a harmful influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@trafic: Testimonials cannot be used as scientific material.
This is perhaps why we refrain from asking questions to psychiatric patients when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric records mention that my psychiatrist mother explains that I was educated telepathically by her stepmother.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say that&#39;s bullshit, that&#39;s unimportant subjective testimony.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and the effectiveness of new treatments) is useless in a scientific approach?
What do you base the research on then?
On fantasies?
Do you put on the same level fanciful theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
“Resilience”: the bogus word adored by grandmothers, fans of JL Delarue, who think they are great psychologists after reading D&#39;ansembourg.
@Jim: Lots of meaningless shrink buzzwords.
Cyrulnik did the “resilience” trick for us.
As he is a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope that he will have tinkered with us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could save us all from Farage and company??
Doesn&#39;t that remind you of Team America?
Seriously, it&#39;s *not* a good idea to bring out the Air Sentinels...
Why, then ?
It was a great series and it seems that those who bring it out know it!
So let&#39;s leave our salvation to the Almighty who can work miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids hooked?
The only solution that comes to mind is humor like wee-poo, which would kill the series.
It was already a series for children.
The children were hooked.
Oh, because it&#39;s a children&#39;s series?
The UKIP work for the Mysterons.
So keep your Team America.
Still in Supermarionation?
It won&#39;t be the same if you don&#39;t see the wires and the animation is well done. :-)
I can&#39;t wait to see this (despite being an adult), but hopefully it will inspire a channel to rerun the old ones.
The series has almost never stopped airing here in Australia; We&#39;ve had one-hour episodes on Saturdays and Sundays at 6 a.m. for at least 40 years.
Since free-to-air digital television arrived a few years ago, it has been on one of the second-rate commercial channels and can still be seen at those times.
And in addition, the half-hour episodes now run at 5:30 a.m., Monday to Friday!
OK, I&#39;m probably a &quot;sad&quot; 60 year old guy, but I don&#39;t watch this show every day!
There is no &quot;Temple Mount&quot; in or under the Esplanade Mosque!!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all the Israeli excavations below and around the mosque of the esplanades for several decades have not found anything.
The Temple Mount, if it exists, is elsewhere.
Maybe in Argentina??
This mount is not sought after for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of the mosques was built.
Its summit, or Dome of the Rock, protrudes in the middle of the Mosque of Omar.
For Muslims, Muhammad ascended to paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham nearly sacrificed his son Isaac.
As long as it has been taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, it is good to remember this regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the 2-state plan, and scuttled it continuously !).
It is also good to show how the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Will God be able to recognize his own?
The shortest of Jewish jokes: &quot;God be praised!&quot;
To boast about tourism in Israel, we are often shown young naiads half-naked, languid on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what the advertising shows us, as can be seen in the photo that illustrates the article.
It&#39;s a bit scary though.
And this photo is a magnificent work of propaganda!
Too bad the Reuters photographer did not take a picture of the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to enter the Temple Mount and who prefer to rock the Jewish worshipers below, praying at the Wailing Wall.
@Mat, If this photo bothers you, it is with good reason, it is neither the newspaper nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she transmits that must be condemned.
This system is not tenable and will end in tears.
The only way to end this system is through revolution.
Since the economy seems to be in a tailspin, big companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have succeeded in convincing their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to raise salaries, while at the same time and without hiding, they have always given salaries more important to the small elite at the top.
You&#39;re right, it&#39;s untenable, but that will only change in this country when workers truly speak with one voice.
Instead of bitching and moaning when someone else goes on strike, support them, show some solidarity, and understand that their strike isn&#39;t just about their issues, but also shows your employer that we don&#39;t piss people off with impunity.
Unless we abandon democracy, in which case it is tenable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries with the worst social and environmental conditions.
Like for example China and India.
All of this cannot end well.
It&#39;s because we&#39;re in a democracy that it held.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to increase the corporate profits held by these people by bypassing national governments through secret tribunals.
It sounds unbelievable, but that&#39;s exactly what the agreement&#39;s Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) mechanism is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people to the unimaginable damage this agreement will have on our lives.
It is only recently that it has started to be talked about in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated behind your back.
Didn&#39;t Churchill say &quot;blood, sweat and tears&quot;?
That makes for great spinoffs, while digital money has no reason to fall let alone grow on trees.
The next weak link will undoubtedly be the automobile market.
This gentleman is right, in the 18th century there were unions in all the regiments
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let it (well, its officers, the others, nobody knows anything) believe itself the strongbox of the eternal values of France, and it will fight and shut its mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this little relic is comforting.
Even if for her, it&#39;s more and more uncomfortable...
You are still missing the union of married men, singles, married women, singles, lost dogs and I don&#39;t know what else
If you don&#39;t write French correctly, I join a union.
You have been warned, it will be your fault.
For the defense of categorial interests, we already suffer enough from the protected professions endowed with unions, which has created a breach of equality with other citizens.
Please don&#39;t laugh about a public servant&#39;s fear of risk.
One can very well imagine a system ensuring a certain freedom of expression without unions, or else without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise disaster assured.
And with the carts that are preparing, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since this is the subject commented here...
Delete &quot;through its delegates&quot; in article 8 of the preamble of the 1946 constitution.
It will become: &quot;8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions as well as in the management of companies.
This is absolutely essential with the irruption of informative power.
And yet you have opened, presumably read and then commented on an article specifically titled “The Great British Bake Off review”. ????
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway it was Joffrey&#39;s wedding that I watched, and I can tell you that some were well seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey&#39;s wedding we have one of the best moments (albeit deceptively: it was the wine) in the history of television.
Also, pie mmmh...
Game Of Thrones !
I love GBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely, the show has ended with a victory for the least worst baker; nobody was like &quot;boom, here&#39;s my fucking cake now eat it and bow to your master!&quot;
Maybe the added pressure of friends and relatives outside finally had an effect for them?
The previous weeks, all these outsiders were kept away.
And there&#39;s also this idea of &quot;playing it safe, there&#39;s always next week&quot; that disappears in the last week.
I like to cook but I can&#39;t imagine doing it to myself.
I&#39;m grateful to those who do and give us great entertainment and push us to try new things.
Onward to GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year&#39;s final challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to make them and they had to tinker one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to decide, I don&#39;t know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real fault they could find was the base being a bit dry (although I agree with Hollywood that the green icing on Richard&#39;s grinder didn&#39;t sound appealing anyway Richard had already lost by then).
I have to admit that several of the challenges in this series feel a little contrived due to the time frame.
There is also cancer lurking, with solar gusts.
Decidedly, everything is working out for us at the moment.
A bad time to pass for humanity, we hope.
You are confusing solar wind with ultraviolet rays.
UV rays are mainly blocked by the ozone layer which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV rays.
So even if the magnetic field were to weaken, there wouldn&#39;t be enough solar wind to &quot;push&quot; ozone out of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and “cancers”.
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV rays.
They have a bunch of useful functions that you wouldn&#39;t suspect.
If we limit ourselves to humans, they have the advantage of allowing us to have bones (synthesis of vitamin D), to heat us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems , to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic UVC and allows UVA and most UVB to pass through.
You know that you don&#39;t have to be condescending and to consider your interlocutor as a retard when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor clarification that was implied in the commentary, which itself intends to show pedagogy.
Without saying that I am used to melanoma, UV rays only ACCELERATE its development.
They don&#39;t CAUSE it.
For proof: all tanned people do not necessarily have melanoma.
Either, when a doctor tells you that you have to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen because UV rays are necessary for all humans.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV rays directly cause melanoma.
Can we bend it?
And, more importantly, can we put it in the blender?
Or put it in the blender...
I believe the majority of those who are interested in it have established that anything can be bent if enough force is applied to it and the sturdiness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for its intended use.
I think the military needs something tougher and hasn&#39;t adopted the iPhone6 as their frontline communications gear yet.
But for us,
It&#39;s still a good choice.
the majority of those who are interested in it have established that anything can be bent if enough force is applied to it
Except a Nokia 3310.
Specifically, is it already folded?
We make this joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth folding joke I read in the comments today.
It&#39;s hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like that.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production line and it is difficult to see how it could return there.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.......................................
Most likely it&#39;s a production unit that didn&#39;t have the iOS installed correctly and is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I have no idea how they do this stuff.
But, would they put testing software on everyone?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of FCC or CE logo and the presence of a prototype red connector.
ah the article for bobo par excellence.
We want inexpensive products and we are surprised that manufacturers produce in &quot;industrial&quot; We highlight super u but all the brands and even small businesses are concerned How to eat good, organic avac 1650€ (average salary in France) ?
But to answer your post, if it&#39;s possible to eat properly with a small salary.
Afterwards, everyone is free to put their priorities where they see fit.
For me, food is one.
Go without hard feelings, I kiss you
We call bobos, or better boboécolos, people who see the world through an ideological &quot;software&quot; that leads them to disconnect from reality.
It is the total thought-reason unbundling.
They are experts in posturing, for example claiming to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartuferie, joining in this the left-caviar, from which they sometimes come, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not support this mixture of clumsy ideology and arrogance, so don&#39;t be surprised to often encounter criticism about them.
Wow, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theorization as well as for all the associated details (plane, shower…).
I would love to be part of it but I can&#39;t find myself there.
The concept is not that complicated.
The boboécolos are one-piece.
Have you understood the concept of the left-caviar?
Well you are able to understand the concept of boboecolo.
It&#39;s the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in ecologists as such.
The boboecolo is one of them but only represents the most visible fringe of ecologists because it is the one that infests the media.
This is a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently no one wants to look this giraffe in the face.
It is so badly made that it vaguely resembles a female nude.
Hush, you&#39;re off the mark.
One must be part of the microcosm of art to understand the stunning beauty of truth in this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to comment since you haven&#39;t spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not the fact that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The point is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous without having any artistic ability.
That&#39;s *art*.
No, it&#39;s pork.
The fact that Emin can&#39;t draw
This is not really a proven fact.
It&#39;s more of an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate are realistic reproductions of dogs smoking while playing pool.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is much more than simply representing reality.
If that&#39;s all you&#39;re looking for, a camera will do.
The author also talks about Emin&#39;s expressionism.
Look again and let the picture speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it&#39;s so easy, why don&#39;t you do it yourself?
There is still something to save money: riding activities, the number of horses in the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
Honesty obliges us to say that France is reducing its workforce, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastically, starting with Great Britain.
It&#39;s only half encouraging...
The operational without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A singular approach, at a time when we observe the weaknesses, the insufficiencies of our defense tool, in particular in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, which lose a dimension of their activities, even a part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuary?
@edmond: that&#39;s what I was saying, look elsewhere to save money but especially not at home, at home it&#39;s really not possible...
This is exactly what you propose to do, look elsewhere where mismanagement is certain.
That all those who have more or less rubbed shoulders with the military thing dare to come and say here, eye to eye that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting out laughing...
Apply the same potion to the entire public service and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really reloud: look at the inflation of public jobs in the other ministries and you will understand why La Défense can consider itself a little loaded!
Well yes, the savings on which everyone agrees to say that it is necessary to make them, it has to be seen somewhere, right?
Bad luck, those on whom it falls moan to the assassination when it arrives at home, the poor darlings.
Should be done but above all that it does not fall on me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How will closing the Val de Grace weaken our defense tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, history repeats itself with each closure of post, maternity, hospital, barracks.
But everyone is for savings of course.
It&#39;s weird, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and is not happy with the savings made in public spending.
This article is truly the most mind-boggling thing I have ever read!
That embarrassing moment when the first three people to comment make the same bad joke.
It&#39;s depressing to scroll through your Facebook feed and see that 80% of your friends have started their statuses with the phrase &quot;This embarrassing moment&quot;.
I think they&#39;re going to make a movie out of it.
It will surely base itself on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally bumps into their ex on the bus on their way to work and only then realizes that her skirt is tucked into her panties.
It&#39;s not embarrassing, it&#39;s completely stupid.
Not really, in my opinion the author adopts the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and grit his teeth.
I&#39;m sure if you&#39;re a Kate Bush fan, the news of her return to the stage after 25 years of absence was something special.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle over who gets the rights?
I don&#39;t have the &quot;internet&quot;.
So I don&#39;t think I can comment.
Not having a computer.
My god, I have to see this movie before I die!
I can&#39;t believe this article is the most amazing thing I&#39;ve ever read!
Charlie has really just demonstrated that he is at the very top of the cosmic universe that is satirical journalism!
I&#39;m falling over!
It is imperative that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the illumination and discover the incredible brilliance and the unsurpassable genius which springs from the keyboard of Mr. Brooker like a divine light.
Good god, that really sucked.
Especially if they are neither women nor transvestites.
I am a parasite.
This shows a positive evolution within democracies: the rise of regional policies and effective associative initiatives.
Until further notice, we are having the right to save our planet confiscated by states that play the tartuffes at each meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, citizens, to take matters into our own hands.
With the commissioner they planted in energy, all these beautiful recommendations flew away ....
Translate: Wind turbines and solar farms are the roundabouts of tomorrow.
All financed by the taxpayer.
Please stop this pro-nuclear talk.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the sector is not mastered in its entirety, it is better to limit it to the laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided of course that we drastically reduce our consumption.
Renewable electricity to fight against CO2 emissions?
France is in no way concerned.
Nuclear electricity means zero CO2 emissions in production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity by renewable wind or PV already means more GHG on the other stages and above all gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for intermittency.
Replacing nuclear power with wind or PV renewables would run counter to the fight against CO2.
Christial I am not insulting you I am a Doctor of State in physical sciences 1981 moreover I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the opposite of what I said.
For what I did not say it is you who lend me ideas I did not say anything about Germany nothing nothing in fact you did not answer what I said and like all people on the right demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I also quote the conclusion of experts commissioned by the German government: Germany&#39;s current renewable energy program is an unprofitable and inefficient way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you don&#39;t count uranium mining and construction and if you don&#39;t count water vapour, a greenhouse gas with less effect than Co2, it&#39;s true, two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power station leaves in water vapor and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you referred to Pakistan as a “South Asian giant”…!!
Last time Pakistan won against Hindustan.
It doesn&#39;t surprise me, most Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India a giant of South Asia...
I have nothing against some Pakistani players participating, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply be opening a Pandora&#39;s box full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for ISL, today&#39;s opener was surprisingly interesting with Athletico Kolkata winning 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions India spends on IPL cricket and now football, how could we ever compete with our &#39;noisy neighbours&#39;...
The race for the low cost launcher is paid for in cash.
Too bad for such a great project.
For the incident, the possible design flaw only manifests itself with too cold helium.
We are therefore perhaps not in a fault of design, but of implementation...
unlike arianespace which is a private company, it seems that soyuz belongs to the russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
They may pay the satellites in frigates who knows..
This is all the more unfortunate since many media repeat only the titles of articles on a loop - and many readers retain only these titles.
Altogether this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Totally agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly questions the project when it is only a launcher problem.
