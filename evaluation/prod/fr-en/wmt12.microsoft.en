Parliament did not ratify the amendment for Tymosenko's release
The Ukrainian parliament has rejected, as part of an amendment to criminal law, the draft repeal of the paragraph relating to the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
MPs rejected at second reading the draft amendment aimed at reducing sentences for economic offences, which could have opened the doors to freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for striking a seemingly disadvantageous deal with Russia to buy natural gas.
The judgement is not final and the court is due to rule on the convict's appeal in December.
Tymosenko calls the ruling a political revenge by the regime and has provoked a process of suspicions of bias from the court also in the west.
The bill to annul paragraph 365 of the Criminal Law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 deputies.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan victory
The Libyan liberation or rebellion already has its defeated.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners have yet to be determined.
As is customary in the region, the winners of the elections are the Islamists, but whether they are moderates or radicals.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the usual law of Sharia law and we already know what it is.
Libya becomes a crime-free country because for a theft you cut off your hand.
Women can forget about emancipation, any non-respect of the faith are liable to capital punishment...
It is the Koran that will unite in place of the personality of the dictator the society composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya there will be such an order as we cannot imagine it and as we certainly would not like.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and probably would not be beneficial to Libyans.
It is particularly astonishing that Islamist warriors gratefully accepted help from infidel dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who led the NATO strikes but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated with each attack.
So when it comes to looking for the winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We participated in the shooting, served Islam and our politicians turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militarily occupying Libya.
So there is no problem for the locals to get rid of the "crusaders".
Without land use, oil companies will have easy access to Libyan black gold?
Perhaps not as much, and the West will eventually be able to boast of selfless protection of human rights.
As long as we prevent these followers of Sharia from doing so.
A new era of crisis begins.
The France and the rest of Europe are in investors' sights.
A statistical tornado passed over Europe on Tuesday.
Each of the states has published GDP information for the 3A.
The Czech economy stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market is breaking all records.
Investors are not only looking at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, Czechia and other European countries earlier published their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP has a forecast growth of 0.5%, that of the France 0.4%.
Both countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany performed better than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the 0.1% expected), however the France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (it was originally a question of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Statistical Office it is confirmed that we are heading towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated in the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter according to forecasts and periodically recalculated data.
The economy of the euro zone and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with what analysts had expected.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
Ten-year bond yield is 28.45%
Bond yields in Spain and Italy are climbing to critical limits.
The problems are starting to be felt in Austria, France, Belgium, etc.
Czech bond yields remain below 4% as the situation worsens in the region.
Voices are being heard in Germany that the ECB should be the guarantee of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate qualification for 200 million
The representation of football has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, they also won thanks to Super Cech and goalkeeper Petr Jiracek 1-0.
Czech football defended dearly with a good deal of luck in the second part of its qualification and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and a large part of luck for the second.
The Czech representation also won thanks to super Cech and hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its qualification for the European Championship.
The Montenegrains found themselves under pressure until the second part because of a precise Czech defense.
The vicitms of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech, Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the coffers of Czech football.
From the first minutes we played a warrior football.
Both teams struggled to put together combinations and the game was mainly concentrated around the center line.
The pressure of the national footballers failed to break through the Czech defence, which responded accurately to long shots even in the first half.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield
A few hundred college students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
With this gesture, they want to support their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from Isfahan universities created a human shield Tuesday around the Isfahan nuclear technology center where uranium is processed.
They have openly expressed that they will defend their country's nuclear agenda at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest information that Iran has not stopped strengthening its nuclear weapons.
There are reports in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the objective of which would be to destroy Iran's nuclear program, the targets would be not only Isfahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
The diet of an obese child: does not eat breakfast and takes cold cuts for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, 9% of schoolchildren are an above average weight and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families that have an unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows once again how important is the environment in which human beings evolve and the models that surround them.
On the tables of obese children we find, for example, deli meats 50% more often than in families of children of normal weight.
19% of obese people had fries at dinner according to the survey conducted with an awareness action "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In the families of the little fat people sport is also not a habit, which is now the case for most schoolchildren today - only 15% answered that at least once a week parents find time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and involved 900 primary school students in the Czech Republic.
This was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", an action supported by the General Health Insurance and the company Unilever.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third grade have enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or even obese children is the lack of a correct diet and not enough physical exercise.
"Only half of the children questioned indicate, for example, eating 5 times a day breakfast-in case - lunch - snack - dinner, which is one of the basic principles of a good diet," says one of the results of the survey.
Without breakfast and cold cuts at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development it takes some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In Czechia, only 23% of students' families eat at the same time.
In most families everyone has breakfast alone.
And the worst that has been noted is that a tenth of the population does not eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is however the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that families of obese children are more often consumed unhealthy fries.
Almost every student - not to mention weight - drinks sugary drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children interviewed play sports regularly but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food from possibilities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating."
Among their favorite dishes there are many cakes, meats and sweets.
"The most alarming is in particular a strong preference for sweet lemonades," the survey results stated.
For lunch, pasta took first place just ahead of white meat.
The children did not want starchy foods at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Focus on health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the moment they receive the relevant information.
"During a control of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness session "Obesity is not a coincidence", there was a determined desire to move towards a healthy diet," indicate the results of the survey.
The most striking was for example with regard to sweet lemonades, as children began to give preference to drinking water.
Children most often ticked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as the main course and would reduce sweet dishes and "knedliky" (Czech specialty of bread flour or potato balls).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a blurb article about how stylists learn how to learn, I got a little angry that there were a lot of them from the beginning.
I didn't think about what would happen next.
Presentations by three professionals of the specialty, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what happens on site.
And it will be worse.
The closer we get to the final exams, the more practical exercises and information await us.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it is really "stuffed".
This time we dealt with the director Alenka (during the course there are no boys) how to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women of this type are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, without any particular curve, another overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically amplify wide arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We were able to emphasize the character nicely and also not to dress too conspicuously types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a thin waist.
For example, if there is a difference between the waist and the hips in such a way that skirts or trousers do not fit at all, it is worth having it customized.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls impeccably is priceless.
In a custom-made skirt you will feel much better than in one that slips constantly, rolls up and does not hold on to the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine appearance can afford a Tucker style clothing, with pieces of fabric sewn, or even embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort through all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that considering what I have to do at home there will be too much.
Each trainee was given a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We must take into consideration the current appearance, the fashion type of the personality as well as its appearance.
I will have to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Secret of Victoria campaign.
Deep down, it makes me happy, because it's better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has gained almost a hundred pounds lately (please don't take my statement completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the internet, print and work on graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic design.
Also thinking about the graphic part of styling is also important.
The stylist does not only dress the physical but creates for example the productive pages in magazines (on given products trends for handbags, coats, etc ...).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic designer, talked to us about all this.
But this,... until Sunday
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests from the specialty gave a diverse look to Saturday's session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with one piece of clothing in a different way.
Variability is essential for this example.
Like for example this trench coat which must be worn in a classic way with jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with pumps and take a picture of it like a dress.
Or just roll up the sleeves or collar and immediately have a new look.
"Play with that," he stressed.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly".
"You can then start violating it," Jakub said.
Finally I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with them, to what, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statements on fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to fashion photographer Ben, that the stylist must have many more variations of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is to say that for fashion story which will have about ten pages (so a dozen models) I must be ready to "resize" at least fifteen of them.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely differently than in reality.
We have to reckon with this during a template creation.
The fact that image and style sometimes make half the success was confirmed to us by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a great singer but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach towards the use of stylists' services is still cautious.
And familiar faces sometimes consider them useless (it is enough that I know something but what I seem passes in second place).
And if someone gets a styling done by us, then we have to rely on the fact that he dictates to us with a high probability a completely different size (smaller) than the one he actually has.
We then have to browse google and make sure if the boulevard news reports the celebrity in question, if she has lost weight or gained weight etc ...
Honza and Mario asked us on Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to orient himself in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he dresses and it is therefore important to be a good psychologist.
Know how to guess people, not flatter yourself, keep your opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort through her cupboard and fill it with new items you can't throw it all away and say, My God what a horror."
"You'll find a few things that you'll find pretty and he you'll advise on what to wear them with," Mario says.
He showed us concretely what must contain everything called the "placovka" or stylist's bag.
It's the one you hang around your waist and carry with you for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined things such as scissors, hair removal rollers or nurse pins, there is also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which a garment is closed in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of staple are not usable because they could damage the garment) or a sewing kit.
So that we are not only people who listen but who have tried something in a practical way they have taught us how to properly resow shoes.
And during the photo shoot in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could be damaged, especially outside.
And so we glued and pasted.
We were not allowed to touch the scissors so as not to inadvertently hurt ourselves.
So you really need skills.
Mario made me happy when he congratulated me on my creation.
The account I am reporting is not for my girlfriend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second class weekend.
I am beginning to understand more and more that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, let everyone say what they want.
The need for speed The Run is contested throughout America.
Revision
Originally a trouble-free race turns into a routine morning trip to work because of a set of stupid mistakes of people who don't care.
To a certain extent, this fulfills everyone's ambition, but it is useless if no one wants to do something more.
The new part subtitled The Run has produced high expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already aged Need for Speed racing series and release a kind of game from playable games that wouldn't just be counted with points.
So we were curious how will be the added passages during which the main hero gets out of his car and does what he wants.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole thing pulls down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes but rather the expression of an incomprehensible laziness on the part of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are caught up in the adventure whose main hero Jack has character problems and to solve them starts participating in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the West Coast in San Francisco and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea has some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than 50 races.
As a result, each race is done on a different route and the planned stages in different environments that stand out quite well from each other and are interesting.
The player does not have the feeling for a moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are also quite pretty even if the graphic technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
Well, it's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snow-capped mountains is very visually pleasing.
The tests are also occasionally embellished with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
Besides that the different races are well arranged one behind the other.
There are only a small number but that is enough.
There are moments you strive to surpass the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you run against the clock (classic duel with the stopwatch) and then again awaits you another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and try to make the situation difficult for you.
The novelty are the passages out of vehicle.
It is more of an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away in front of someone and you have to help him by tapping the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is good like that because this element is not likely to hinder and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that enhance the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that currently there is nothing extraordinary but we can not say that it is negative.
As for the realistic simulation you will have to look elsewhere.
But although one can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So everything is ok.
Problems begin to appear after some time.
In contrast to the driving model, that of collisions is not yet developed.
We don't expect complicated warping and collisions from this game, but when you don't have any idea how your car behaves when colliding with any object, it's not completely good.
During tight overtaking you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car goes into crazy aerobatics.
Or ends up in tatters.
Thanks to the restart system this is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The restart is done so that when you have broken your face or you have gone out in the scenery the game takes you back to the moment of the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 reboots.
When you have used the 5 reboots you have to start the game again from the beginning.
So it's more of a tool, in case something doesn't go right, than something you can really rely on.
Sometimes restarts do not help and you have to find the solution by remembering from memory the piece of route in question.
The big problem with this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example there are certain turns that must be passed in a certain way otherwise it does not pass.
Otherwise you meet on a given place "civilian" vehicles always in the same configuration whether you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds early or one minute late.
What angers you are the situations when you easily see the opponent pass between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you have to either stand aside and conture them or brake.
It is equal if you go in front of him because it is "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation he always arrives very close to your nose.
Opponents have other advantages.
During the whole time of the game, you, you arrive in certain places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same opponent who precedes you in the same place.
This annoys the most at the end of the game when you drive on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must at all costs pass in front of you.
When it passes in front of you it hides the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you collide a good number of times.
It is understandable that the goal of this game is to do something captivating and full of adredaline, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And it's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and the places with so much action that you do not have time to follow everything that happens.
And it is equal if it is because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there is no chance of getting bored or anything else.
The original idea is the change of car during the races.
You have to pay attention to the gas pumps on the routes because you can change cars however most of the time the one you have is enough for you.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American engines for straight highways and super sports cars with exotic finery on highly technical driving for example on winding roads in the mountains.
And the challenge mode, which are races in particular places that you know from the adventure, goes very well with the main regime of the story.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that are added to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unlock:
It connects online with the Autolog function which, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult blows to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it looks like).
Your speedometer tells you between 150 and 200 km/hour (a priori) and behind you arrives a metro train that sends the car directly to the scrap yard.
At the editors we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought about it when creating this game or if the authors really take us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally nice and in some cases really great.
What is disturbing is that in more extreme situations, the imagery does not hold up and in some cases tragically.
This especially concerns accidents with a large number of participants when fluid imaging is no longer useful to you.
The sound part is good and the track is your choice.
In order to please as many people as possible and especially the most young audiences, a new soundtrack has been created in the style "I mix everything", but we can expect that no one will buy the game for the music.
Overall impression of Need for Speed: So the Run is really confusing.
If the game didn't have these stupid mistakes we could safely say that this is the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game feels like it's not finished.
The fun is really good but be prepared for mistakes to hit you in the eye with the force of an aerodrome reflector.
Les Etudiants de velours in concert with the choirs of Charles University

Those interested will find all the information on the internet pages of the festival www.festaacademica.cz.
Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave like negativists and eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically removed the balance between the institutions"
"I didn't expect such a tough war."
"It will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all the players get used to their new role", this is how Miléna Vicenova began her presentation at the Faculty of Law the Czech Ambassador to the European Union.
When she managed to describe the various EU bodies and their relations in such an understandable and visible way, to the point that many lecturers at Charles University's Faculty of Law might envy her, she showed how seriously she takes her motto "understandable and openly about Europe".
Ms Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning there was criticism that he is bland, that he is a leather-ring, that he cannot take over any mission and I must say that he took everyone's breath away because he plays his role perfectly."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take Europe."
She explained the new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in response to the question: "Who is who in the European Union?" "What telephone number should I call?", so as an important step towards the unity and greater clarity of the Union's policy towards states, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban us from our syrecky (cooked cheese that smells very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also referred to the agenda that the European Council has lived, is living and will live in the near future.
She described the Czech Presidency of two years ago as a success.
The Czechs solved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis or organised an Eastern Partnership Summit.
She described the fall of the government as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, "activity has been in full swing" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved even now.
In addition, the Union's new seven-month budget, which is becoming very complicated because of the current economic situation, must be approved.
As it would seem that the budget will be thin and with a view to savings, which branch will have priority, which countries will receive the most aid, the least, everything has to be resolved in the context of future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an understandable Europe".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels nobody makes round or twisted pickles, bananas that are differentially large or that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky".
She wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the EU institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have the reputation of being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect rather than positively.
Moreover, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
According to her, the fault is the result of several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a cover letter and weak support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, she then stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Pole, the Magyar, the Slovak come to me, this Frenchman says to me: 'Hey, what are you doing there, what else is this Visegrad group doing?' And he's not happy at all."
According to Vicenova, in the near future new tough rules on fiscal policy await member countries.
It is the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed, Europe that prevails rather than a 'new European Federation'.
"We have countries in the eurozone and others outside the zone."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the Institute for Enhanced Cooperation."
In the first place it was said that countries that want it cooperate with each other and those that do not want to stay in their corner."
"There will be many such institutes and there will be a truly two-speed Europe," Vicenova said.
From this point of view, she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all issues having an impact on the EU should be debated between all EU members and not only the members of the eurozone.
History of a brand:
IBM innovator begins second century of existence
If someone were to look for the word that most closely expresses the IBM strategy, the closest would be "the long term".
For a wide audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has passed a hundred years.
The foundation for this long-term strategy was laid by the firm's first CEO, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left the slogan that many global problems can be solved if people are willing to think.
Its slogan "THINK'!" has become the imprint around which the life of a future giant will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
This was the basis of Watson's carefully crafted company culture.
For us, IBM means long-term thinking of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that it always remained true to its core values and yet was not afraid to change everyone else around it.
This has enabled us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more," said the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano for the anniversary.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the thirties, began to look after his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - the IBM people were the only ones among the first American employees to have paid vacation, employer-paid insurance plus a stylish employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and traders.
In the same way, IBM has a well-developed system of relationships with the customer.
The company was initially brilliant at discovering talent – as one of the first firms to abolish all forms of discrimination and thus could have a choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman - Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has been with IBM for thirty years and currently holds the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years has been doing what is called jamy, online brainstorming from which a lot of future strategies and innovations have emerged.
It is no wonder that he has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures it a secure position in the field of business.
"From the beginning, IBM had a concept more of an institution than a technology firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, professor of economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a tech firm but a firm that helps solve business problems using its technology," added Geogre Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating that market.
IBM - or the "Big Blue", as it is colloquially called in the United States because of its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown to become one of the largest companies in the world.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services at the level of server products up to nanotechnology.
It holds numerous patents from every U.S. technology firm and five of its employees have been awarded Nobel Prizes.
Among his discoveries are for example the ATM, the payment card, the financial swap, the barcode or the diskette.
IBM found itself this year with $220 billion the second largest technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Preview in advance
Not all innovations and manufactures were preferred by the customer and at the time - IBM, for example, did not succeed in the bet on its own OS/2 operating system, the Online Prodigy service or the IBM PCjr computer:
"As long as your business is built on movement in advance, you can't emotionally hang on to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms and when they do not work it leaves.
Unlike for example the Microsoft competitor which basically stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
Technology in perspective
In IBM revenues, services, which are formed for a fifth by software and hardware, have a preponderant place.
However still in 1990 it was with more than the motié of participation the strongest representative of hardware.
Starting in 2000 IBM sold low-yielding assets for $15 billion, during that period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
It continues in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time it surpassed the new financial crisis.
IBM trades according to the precepts of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis also increased its volume of investments.
It now appears that IBM is passing the current crisis without being worried?
IBM's share price has risen since 2008 in rocket by 120 percent, the net profit of the firm continues to grow.
The logo of the IBM firm is to change everything but not its values.
We can expect this flexible giant to master other crises.
IBM History: From slices of cheese to flights into the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it initially had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It changed its name to IBM in 1924 - initially a trademark used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 80s of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old "time clocks", the clocks that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 chaired the company's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of the firm - it is on Watson's ideas that the identity and culture of the company rests until now.
Watson became head of the Kusqu firm in 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production of every possible machine for business and commerce - from cheese and meat slicers to cash registers.
In Watson's first four years as director, sales grew to $9 million and began expanding to all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable to the firm that after 40 years of management his son became director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 60s the people and computers at IBM helped NASA guide flights into the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the consulting company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that has been successful at IBM over the past three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and city management.
As for the field of commerce, IBM recently developed a "Smarter Commerce" platform that helps salespeople manage the entire business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in our territory.
It created its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe headquarters in Prague and there is also the world-class research and development team that deals with speech recognition.
Ryshtarova on her unfaithful husband:
Ivette you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtarova (53) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) became a bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
Only she could not wait and established clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," Rychtrarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave Bartosova asylum in her house in the summer, she had no idea that her relationship would not last.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted on moving from Ricany, Pepa did not push the singer away.
And he confessed in public that he loved her.
Over time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's affair and ended up saying goodbye to him forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in who her husband sleeps with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to greet him on the doorstep of the house.
"He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common home, no one will kick him out."
"He will no longer be my beloved and lost old donkey, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," Rychtarova leaked, showing that she has detached herself from her husband but that they only remain in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door to him is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I will stay with Iveta and not change."
"My wife set up a marriage on paper and I respect that."
"The company continues, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I buy".
"Darina and I talk in a completely normal way but we don't sleep together," Rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he will not stop it.
"We don't sleep together and I'm not interested in where she's going, with whom and if she's having an affair.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility on myself," Joseph concluded.
Women's worst vices: Does this concern you too?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all of them, both of them, are able to get them "out of their sleeve".
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines feminine vices that manage to pump blood from the veins of men.
Purchasing
Your other half makes you remarks that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one garment a week?
Are you happy to buy and in packages at the time of the sales?
In your case we can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for shopping.
But you will say, which one would resist window shopping in clothing stores, looking for pretty clothes for yourself and then trying them all on in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become a real hell for the man.
Just remember how many times have you told your spouse that he is waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat"?
"I would need to lose at least 5 pounds - should I start doing sports?"
"Do you like it?"
Don't those phrases remind you of something?
Yes?
So you're one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the issue you should stop looking after yourself but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about his appearance.
The stronger sex does not hesitate to say that the more the frequency of these complaints increases, the more poisonous women become.
Odre and cleanliness in first place
It's like an infinite merry-go-round.
Washing windows, vacuuming, cleaning floors, dusting, stripping the bathroom - and that twice a week.
Do you make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they have soiled the sink, clogged the living room window, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you suffer from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness, however, can ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The undermining work
"Put that worn tracksuit in the trash."
"Are you planning to put on those old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the floor."
If you do this undermining work on your partner in this way several times a day, you will really break it down.
It is obvious that you do not think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much undermining work...
Defamation, persiflage
Defamation, persiflage but also insults against someone are also the characteristic of some women.
Women are particularly interested in relationships and are therefore happy to deal with topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us lets out a little harmless persiflage here and there.
The hand on the heart is however a peculiarity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persif, even despise others and are particularly dangerous for those around them - especially at work in a women's collective.
Jagr and Voracek helped with their participation in Philadelphia's victory
Hokeyist forward Jagr twice helped Philadelphia win during Monday's NHL game on Carolina ice and once again leads the Czech productive players for the contest.
From the perspective of 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made yet another pass and was named the best player of the game, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays for Jagr, also recorded two goals in the game.
Jagr told reporters across the Atlantic after the game that he had warned Giroux that it would be a big night.
"I told him before the game that he would give his hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes that feeling hits on you," Jagr said after his action Giroux scored a goal on the Flyers' first shot.
A moment later there was a second assault by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes' goal for the puck and introduced it to scorer Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, home player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the start of the second game belonged to the Flyers.
Concretely in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds converted a fourth.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league but he's definitely in the top three," Jagr said of his centre.
"I never thought I'd play at the end of my career with a Hokeyjist like him."
"I'm really happy with that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years in the NHL the other players on the team have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this match because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shot she finished with a difference of one goal.
Matt Read did not rule out other complications that finished two-on-one.
"Pronger made excellent attacks in our area."
"He hit the puck, I picked up speed and (Read) went to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I succeeded," the final goal of the game described from his Voracek perspective.
Philadelphia came in with the win at the top of the Eastern Conference.
Montreal's Czech defenseman Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the game with Buffalo and was out in the second half with an upper-body injury.
The Candians didn't hold their two-goal lead against an experienced defender and lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
It was the fact that the back line was sick that mostly bothered the local coach rather than lost poins because they played the game with only 5 defenders.
"It sucks."
"We only played the game with an experienced player, the rest were youngsters."
"But there's nothing to do, that's the way it is," says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement after replacement wasn't enough and we couldn't resist."
"We just had to simplify the game, push the puck out of our zone."
For that we had limits," added one of the defensemen P.K. Subban.
Czech defenceman Ondrej Pavelec was part of Winnipeg's thirtieth attack and victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated in a goal for the Jets, who stopped a 5-game losing streak.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered trips mostly to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays to East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A big exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have an inclination towards the west and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for citizens of the socialist bloc (also for Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of socialist countries.
In case the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation otherwise the individual trip was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West however you had to queue all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The currency deal that was the condition for traveling to the west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who couldn't travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency, however, was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the agreement of currencies (Western currency) to travel to the West.
Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were consequently many country houses and cottages that Czechs bought and this habit continues until now.
Since 1989, the travel of Czechs has undergone a great revolution.
Although until 1989 holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at their maximum, last year Czechs spent 4 million vacation days abroad in countries around the world.
The great paradox of which we are not aware today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because it was part of the Yugoslavia of the time.
The abolition of visas in the 90s of the last century in the western neighboring countries caused a huge wave of short-term visits especially to Austria, Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not travel by plane to the west for a long time, which everyone wanted to see for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, travel organizations made Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay for hotels or board.
The typical feature of a trip of Czechs at that time was to take with you your own food preserves, sausage, etc. to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech koruna which finally allowed our tourists after decades to be able to freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average salary have increased, which has provoked around the year 1997 another important moment.
Thanks to a growing demand for travel, travel agencies have started since 1997 to prepare tours with air charter connections that thanks to contracts have tremendously reduced costs compared to what was there before.
At the end of the 90s of the last century the Czechs had visa-free connections with practically most developed countries around the world except the US which later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic was prepared.
Since this year, as every year, direct air charters have taken Czech tourists to distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
That's more than 100,000 Czechs who visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development arrived in 2008.
On November 17, 2008 the US abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to completely join the group of developed countries.
Also in 2008 Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person on holidays abroad including ancillary expenses. Crowns per person.
The general assembly must find its President but this risks ending in a situation without a solution "one pat"
Almost 5 months already Czech football is without a President and it risks that the successor of Ivan Hasek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after another General Assembly to be held on Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement on which voting rules should be used.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the management of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek football has backtracked to differences between the chambers of the Association who cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was completely demonstrated on September 16 when it was necessary to choose a new president.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiations remained stalled and there was not even talk of dealing with how to elect.
There was no agreement as to who had the right to vote in the General Assembly — only the statutory representatives or also the staff members with full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since that moment with the help also of the Office for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences still continue over the rules for the election.
It is all too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has contributed nothing to the situation either.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times but the nerve centre remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the pat.
"The bone of contention lies in the fact that either proceed according to the statutes or find another model," said Dusan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, who represents professional football in the association.
According to the rules of the planned model wins in the third round the candidate who has received the most votes in percentage in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is prepared, according to what is said, to withdraw so that the candidate who has received the largest percentage of votes in both chambers wins.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the percentage of votes.
"Only then would it make you lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely reject the bicameral concept," admits Svoboda, who understands the objections of the Moravian side and according to whom it would be best not to change the rules and vote according to the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even if he believes that the rules of the elections established according to the statutes benefit Pelta the most among all the candidates.
"I want us to vote as much as possible according to the statutes of the association."
"So that there are not yet absurd ideas imagined by a representative as during past General Assemblies," said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations defined himself especially against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The qualification possible today in the European Championship should calm everyone down."
"Football will once again be on a wave of happiness and there is more enthusiasm for cooperation," added the Jablonec officer who among the three has the greatest experience in leading football both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"It's not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change the drawing regulations."
"This may cause a deadlock again in the General Assembly."
"I still hope that sound reason wins," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some meetings are expected to take place directly in Montenegro but who can say if the entire football management will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight in which Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl were to travel to Podgorice did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was being sought to take part of the Executive Committee to the field of retaliation.
In the end, it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, that should be decisive.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the torn parties in the strongest sports association in the country and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union which must determine the direction of Czech sport after Sazka's financial problems.
Paclik is going to fight for the post of President because he sees no correct candidate.
If the head of the Plzen footballers Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asks for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not be campaigned for this high office.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I do not stand for election."
"But in the current situation it has not been possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech News Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try to prevent Pelta from becoming head of the AFRT, which a priori would be given favorite for this election.
Paclik also stressed that if he won the elections he would hold the post of President only until 2013, the year scheduled for a General Assembly.
He would see in the function an experienced and high-level manager who is not linked to the world of football.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he says.
"For me it was terrible when some people told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football right now."
"I would like to change this image," he added.
What is said to bother Paclik most is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Plzen Regional Football Union Roman Berbr, a man of reverse fame who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates to the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable for Pelta to occupy this position of President.
"If he wins, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying trader, it would be even less favorable to football," Paclik proclaimed.
What still shocks him is the fact that Pelta's name was uttered a few years ago during wiretaps as part of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta escaped without any difficulty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," says Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes president, I sell the Plzen club".
In the event that Paclik triumphs in Thursday's vote, he would have to prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been endorsed by Paclik before the September General Assembly that ended in fiasco, feels the same way.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go with."
"He has great abilities"
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as head of representation."
"But as manager of the Association he would not be able."
"I don't stick my nose into what I don't know," says Paclik, who in September attracted a lot of attention when he voted for the cancellation of the Referees' Committee with Ludek Macela replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to manage private firms and that he also leads since last year the club of Plzen which celebrated with his support last May its triumph in the first division.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture to it."
"I would curb the influence of certain interested groups that tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, for example, which leads to situations in bad taste," added Paclik, who does not hide his antipathy for Sparta leader Daniel Kretinsky.
He would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose power to lobby high-level politicians would make it possible to obtain more money for sport from the gaming tax.
"This is one of the key points that the new president should deal with."
"If it is the gambling tax as the political parties say, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not take his current affair with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself says that the AFRT president should be "above parties".
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal."
I don't see any reason to pass on my shares from the Plzen club to anyone if I have to come back a year and a half later," Paclik said.
Pelta promised new statutes for the AFRT that should put an end to pat's situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidates Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should put an end in the future to the quarrels over the rules for the elections.
The Jablonec official is very optimistic ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes that today's success of the football representation should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta promised to devote himself to national representation and obtaining financial means if elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the last General Assembly and this two-month delay could well allow him to defend his vision of the direction of football and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for Thursday to have a president."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take over the leadership of the Association," he adds, but he is above all linked with the club of Jablonec, has worked for many years at Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
This is also why he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election lies a euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the General Assembly in June statutes were approved which were not perfect as everyone realized".
"If it weren't for all these different interpretations we would have already had a president since September," Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that took all the attention of the delegates.
"If I become president, I take it as a personal mission and am ready to take all the responsibility in case it doesn't work."
"This is a principle without which we cannot exist," Pelta added.
Then he tries, it is said, not to confront his opponents.
He has previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl, whom he recognizes in view of his legal training and that he knows full well that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He has also not attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time, who on the contrary does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"He's been playing in football for a year and has already had some success."
"His attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"That's also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said to his opponent but remains, he says, faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest level competitions to national representation.
It should be a football window.
"And I would also try to finish all the cases that start with that of the Bohemians or the continuation of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football," the 46th candidate told Czech news agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head of football would not bring any change of people.
"I should get to know all the employees," he told Strahov, where there is understandable nervousness since there is no management.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he thinks that delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is a single point of contention on how to vote in the third round we will be able to overcome it."
"Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there is a new leader at its head," Pelta optimistically declares two days before the day that is probably decisive for his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership AFRT would start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at Thursday's General Assembly it would not please many people.
Rajchl promises, however, that if he is elected, hard work will begin.
He wants systemic changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the various areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemian affair, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President I want to take care of football as a whole."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and successful youth football."
"But I'm not saying I'll do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview with CTK.
"I am a team player and want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each of the members takes care of a specific area."
"And I will distribute difficult missions so that football faces a big step forward."
"A lot of people won't be happy because it's going to be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
He is said to have indicated that he would not run again as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, they know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if it's worth it and if I'll have people behind me who will constantly put obstacles in my way and cast doubt on my every action," he hesitated.
"A lot of people told me I shouldn't give up because they would give up too."
"It's a trust I can't betray," he says.
What motivates him, it is said, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"In the last two years there has been a lot of work done and I don't want to let it down."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said with the fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union would return to the way it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't know how to do."
"Behind him are people who would make football in such a way that it would only be for those who have been chosen."
"I can be blamed for a number of things but certainly not for putting up with any."
"I try to be objective."
"I want to make football for everyone because everyone will be happy with it not just those who have been chosen.
And he confirms again that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if there are those who say otherwise, I am ready to do my utmost for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian, whose winners would meet in the first division."
"There would not be a situation like currently with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem right now is to find young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, has entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I constantly feel support from the Czech Chamber which elected me its vice-president and knows that with me there will be successes," said Rajchl, who plans to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, contract negotiations with television and the gambling law.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a fault common to all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him Czech footblal would lose its credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"No one can doubt in Plzen that he has done a superb job this year."
"If elected he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make any noticeable change among the people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to spoil his success," Rajchl said, who assessed his rivals.

UFO optics paddling pools, gorgeous Budapest pools: Whoever travels through Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after turning the city or taking a long walk - can let his tired legs rest in sparkling water baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool one can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip for the past 18 months, there is one object that should not be missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying on her back in the water, she watched the artistically arranged domes, and swam against the Putten marbles that awaited her on the other side of the pool and admired the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If an indoor swimming pool pleased her, she would immediately write down all the interesting details about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been surveyed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and she presented them in her already published book: "Badefreuden (Joys of the Bath". The municipal indoor swimming pools of Munich, the historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
She has taken her "trips to the most exceptional baths in Central Europe" in 13 countries. In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czechia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true fan of bath culture.
Meder, explains that she does not have much interest in the sport but she feels drawn to the water in a totally different way.
It's irritating that swimming fans have to settle for blue tiles and the stench of bleach while joggers breathe in the mesmerizing scent of spruce forests or can listen to the chirping of happy birds in the park.
"I once wondered why swimming pools actually have to be so ugly all the time," said the Viennese.
"So I was starting a collection of beautiful baths."
The water surface reinforces the architecture twice
A dive in a pool and volatile sauna oils – a feel-good factor in swimming rooms – are huge because all the senses are awakened, according to Meder.
And if the builders would have taken a little more trouble, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a water surface in the swimming rooms."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically presented in a double way: high vaults, multicolored tiles, springboards.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes a worthy 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes you want to take a leap into the blue.
Collector Meder discovered remarkable examples during her research in Hungary.
Next to splendid wellness baths like the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing waters in a natural cavern in the karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath whose basins are filled with alkali water and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the outdoor heated swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the Zürich bath you have the whole city in your eyes, you can admire the snowy Arlberg from an outdoor pool in St. Anton: The Turkish bath has a window from which you can observe the animation on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the Ötztal mountains rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the smell of bleach does not emanate from all the pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate a smell of sulfur, from the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong smell of oil, which it is difficult to believe, to be in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen which is almost black and its silt sticks to your skin as soon as you lid into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her quest for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free, open-air outdoor pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded field.
The bath designed by the architek Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was meanwhile closed.
Glancing out the window of the Art Nouveau building in red-white-yellow, she observed the blooming weeds between the tiles.
She observed the opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the thermal palace in Bad Wildbad.
This building has already survived three phases; one can discover not only neo-Roman elements that have come out since its conception in 1844 but also a Moorish room in Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the spa palace remains the favourite bath of pool expert Iris Meder – and not just because she is from Schwarzwald.
"It's already a great achievement to merge such different building styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter.
Agricultural speculation
German bank examines commodity speculation in detail
By Christian Teevs
Is the German bank abandoning its commodity speculation?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has set up a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the leader of the group then wants to draw conclusions.
Hamburg-
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable for banks to speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann points out in this article that stock market speculation on global commodities pushes prices up and that banks share complicity in global famine.
The consumer protection campaign is concretely aligned against the head of Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
Commodity speculation was initially introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts now share the opinion that bettors have detached themselves from supply and demand - and benefit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently from American competitors: He promised to investigate the accusations and said, "no case is worth jeopardizing Deutsche Bank's good reputation."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the accusations of Foodwatch-Report.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, after which the results of Deutsche Bank's board of directors must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could result in a reduction in the commodity market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his Image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation about rising food prices shows in a particularly draconian way how today's banks harm the public interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly obligated today.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculation," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it's about starving people or whether Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake."
Ackermann's awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wants to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman of the board of directors will not change anything planned in the board of directors.
It could improve its brand image with an abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation.
And about possible losses, he hardly has to worry about them - his successor will worry about them.
One in two would terminate investments in commodities.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the Tuesday poll, with which on November 7 and 8 the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires with 1,001 people.
Just eleven percent found it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many of the bank's customers would also suffer personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such operations: one in two would, following the survey, terminate all investments for which money is injected into commodity speculation.
43 percent would advise against such a bank to their entourage, 49% answered that they would consider terminating their account to change banks.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that moved
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with highs, lows and a Happy Ending: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruin.
Now it is open again and serves as an exhibition house.
If one is enthusiastic about modern post-war architecture, for its clear forms, glass sheds, bright and bold looks and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Fair in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion once received the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its lightweight and suspended steel and glass construction.
The construction is considered to this day as an important step in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous that he also built the Pavilion for the following Austrian World's Fair.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house and adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the Universal Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at Vienna's South Station, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th century museum opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the artwork, so not a good environment.
However, it was used for just as long, until contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building has been empty and has become increasingly dilapidated.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name "House of the 21st century" and will in future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening the Belvedere Museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every way.
The new beginning was led by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvédère in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career among others in her youth as a figure skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, she particularly carried out the transformation work with politicians and the protection of monuments,  It has secured and operated public and sponsorship funding.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited, a café and a bookshop are located there, and an office is to be built there.
Strict monitoring, low budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal performer.
Not only because he had sensitively transformed and expanded the secession of Joseph Olbracht and won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" place where he had seen "practically every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost its generosity and lightness following its move to Vienna and its change of use.
In the current transformations, there were big problems: the building was "a sinkhole in energy," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was installed and the roof replaced with special safety glass.
Thermal bridge joists have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a dim light panel between the house and the road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it's almost a new construction, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in a rust protection shade of red-brown color.
And the movie theater is even exactly the same as it once was.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that were good and cheap had to be found, and that also pleased the office of monument protection," says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a raw floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz said recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City" story.
Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a stroke of luck of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands precisely the newly planned "central station district", with offices and apartments.
And perhaps another stroke of luck will happen: the 21st Century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the temporary Berlin art center, and as it is said, she is already negotiating with the city in order to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn is planning a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has drawn up a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees is expected to double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million more this year in this regard.
The daily "Bild"-Zeitung reported beforehand, citing an internal crisis plan of the group, that investments totaling about 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should allow for better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the event of extreme weather.
Among other things, the number of internal and external employees for snow removal at railway facilities and platforms is expected to double to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the platforms of snow and ice until the start of the service phase and 90 per cent of the switches and crossings required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago station master Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a summit conference about train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems with the transport of users, because it lacks, among other things, reserves in case of difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for years for authorization from the Ministry of Railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has had plenty to do for years, as it has to have the axles of ICE trains checked much more often in the workshop, after an axle break occurred on an ICE at Cologne Central Station.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions in penalties in the USA.
After the case of the chief Josef Ackermann there is news in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" must pay a fine amounting to millions.
As if Deutsche Bank's problems were not already enough, the past of this giant of the sector catches up with it in the USA: the Frankfurt institute pays in comparison 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The financial markets regulator NCUA accuses the big banks of inciting cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost a huge amount of value during the financial crisis and dragged the banks down.
"We are satisfied that we were able to find a solution on this matter, without the parties starting a procedure in court," said an interlocutor of Deutsche Bank in New York.
The Bank did not admit any wrongdoing in comparison.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions from both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the United States and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the billions of dollars in damage.
The comparisons concluded now are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other major banks to task and in the summer it sued JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Regarding the question of mortgage documents, it is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit houses are at the base of this.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events are already a few years old, at the moment it is blowing a storm wind on the American banks.
Investors and supervisors have brought numerous remedies to obtain redress or sanction for breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
It accuses 18 major international banks, the two American state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of having benefited in kind during mortgage deals of about $ 200 billion.
Deutsche Bank must also file an appeal with the FHFA, this is several operations totaling $ 14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities ask that the Frankfurter answer for "substantial losses" but without citing a specific sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unjustified and said it wanted to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett increases by 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the finance guru, is investing huge sums in IBM's IT business.
Since March, it has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
Until then, the big American investor Warren Buffett constantly explains that he does not invest in IT companies, since the long-term evolution of companies only shows bad forecasts.
However, he read IBM's reports and changed his opinion on investing in this sector.
He must have already understood much earlier that IBM mainly offers IT services and systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight's attack in the world of finance.
Therefore, the IBM IT business grants itself the right to call itself "Mr. IBM".
Because Buffett revealed today on the economic program CNBC, that he has bought since March IBM shares worth $ 10.7 billion.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway became a major shareholder of IBM with a 5.5 percent share.
Buffett said IBM has never known anything about that commitment so far.
He congratulated the management, which even during the economic crisis had ensured reasonable profits.
"You did a great job," Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been focusing on lucrative IT services as the operation of accounting centres for some time.
The IT pioneer, more than 100 years old, offers software and consulting as well as high-performance business computers.
Buffett had so far avoided tech companies instead.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
But on the contrary, Buffett is attacking rail freight, lubricant or machine manufacturers.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares in a whole series of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
This 81-year-old octogenarian had taken over in the 60s" the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and had established it as one of the most prestigious companies in the world, thanks to intelligent investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That's why he is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha."
After the announcement of Buffett's investment, IBM shares rose one percent on the stock market.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also known, has a total market value of more than $220 billion and, along with Apple and Microsoft, is one of the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he doesn't want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell", the Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
One newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which is now being reborn.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population reacted with fear and concern.
For many German-Turks the specter that was thought to be long dead is reappearing: since the firebombings in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable to this right-wing extremist context against the Turks.
There has never been any question of xenophobia in Germany.
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions whose size is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to bloody ideology", "This was the title of the publication on the Internet of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" points out that one of the authors would have been a V-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and worries that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right quagmire.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted in a reasoned way: this weekend it called for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a ceremony to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with cheerful colors that the cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media have the effect of a slap in the face: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform - "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
The German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not hesitate to draw unequivocal conditions from it.
"It's starting to stink" is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He points out that people were murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The police action was perceived very critically on the German-Turkish forums and they had subsequently debated the success of their research.
Why it did not already occur much earlier to the German authorities to carry out research in certain suspicious circles of the extreme right, the authors are astonished.
More than one is ready at least for rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be botched, the migrants will have nothing left but self-defense and armament."
"It will be the best self-defense."
"Internal peace in Germany strongly depends on the quality of information and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network," writes "Selen".
What this means if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 90s have explained well.
The photo of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, to what mistrust and distance by acts of violence could lead.
The attacks, however, have sharpened the sense of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
In the past, it was mainly the failure of German policy after the attacks that the Turkish press complained about: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish Head of State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted at the time in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population produced.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax burdens.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German-Turks has been towards the local rule of law since that date.
In addition to efforts to further clarify and reassess far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The Lake Zürich scandal bank
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and is now skating from one crisis to the next.
It is a German who must lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure as head of the Bundesbank; It was announced in July that in 2013 he would occupy an almost equally spectacular position: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the major Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoiced, saluted; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recently achieved solidity and passed on kind observations about future colleagues.
"UBS has achieved the turnaround".
"I am looking forward to the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, by September it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had hijacked all of the bank's security systems and had burned about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Chairman of the Board Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has since been considered to be suffering - and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally coming back?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised by the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship already in May - not in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more an economics professor and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adjustment.
In one fell swoop he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long since earned the title of "the largest tabloid bank in Europe".
Indeed, UBS is on the one hand huge – until recently, it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other, it has been skating from one scandal to another for years.
Nothing, it seems, spares the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also cunning, she had combined with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So UBS managed on the one hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
It made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later a long-time banking professor in Zurich says: "I have always taken UBS as a model of good banking in front of my students."
"From the current perspective, one wonders: how could I have just been so wrong?"
He was profoundly mistaken.
In 2007 it became apparent that for the first time something was wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year President Peter Wuffli surprisingly retired, who until then had been regarded as a top intellectual as well as a brilliant banker.
A few months later it was anticipated why he had left.
The division of the bank had blazed with sub-prime documents and had to write off billions.
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of CHF 13 billion and wrote it off.
For this it did find investors, but who, not long before, would have frowned: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was passed over in silence, to the point that we never even learned its name.
But that was only the first shot.
In April 2008 it got worse.
The bank was to announce losses amounting to billions again, the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second highest paid board of directors in Switzerland, withdrew.
In October 2008 disaster followed: UBS was, given its investment mistakes, in the financial crisis before bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The SNB bought back tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation donated six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because it noted how dramatic it can be for a small country, to be home to such large banks.
Finally, UBS's balance sheet total in 2007 was more than five times Switzerland's economic performance (see chart).
"We couldn't save UBS again," says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster followed the second.
Already a few months earlier, UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of wealthy clients, who had evaded the tax authorities perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million - in reimbursement of unjustified profits from these operations with an increased fine.
Thus UBS more or less published that it had aided in tax evasion.
At the same time it has lost something that has always been its capital in competition with wealthy clients: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the head of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of money from customers.
Thus, in a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors: banking investment because of bad speculation and asset management because of aid to tax evasion.
And, as there was a bit of a return to calm, and as was thought, that UBS would get away with it, there followed this unfortunate story of securities dealers: a single securities dealer soared 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And we publish: with risk management in investment banking it still does not seem to work.
"With the Adoboli case, we have seen that risk management has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
So the CFO of a major German bank is sure: "UBS's problem is that it does not have control of risks in hand."
However, this was exactly the idea of prudence, with which Swiss bankers had long since taken office, that of becoming the guardian of the world's great fortune: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine Republic.
The treasuries of Swiss banks had become the symbol of unwavering reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
UBS's headquarters in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the solid cliché of the private Swiss bank – it is only a little bigger.
Already the situation is classic.
The Bank has its headquarters at Zurich Main Station, which leads directly from the Main Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are prestigious, shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers like Tiffany's can be found here between traditional Swiss shops as well as those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss bankers have resided here for centuries: from the national bank and the Credit Suisse Palace to elitist private banks like Julius Bär.
You can enter the UBS lobby through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are clad in marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank's logo, a large label for "safe".
UBS knows what the client is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has at one time or another sidelined the market - or betrayed the two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, but like all Swiss bankers he also does business with the two big banks.
UBS would have become far too big, he finds - especially in banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would have also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say about it.
"And even so, they have long since adapted to the mores of the Anglo-Saxons."
It was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed UBS, it made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million inhabitants undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
With up to about 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, the politicians agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three major Swiss banks jointly concluded a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for little Switzerland - and has been steadily growing.
What helped was that UBS's two different predecessor banks complemented: a rich, but lethargic bank with asset management in Zurich as its strong point and a poorer, but admittedly already more highly internationalized, one.
Suddenly, international investment banks had favorably access to a lot of money, with which they were able to spin a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with UBS's rise: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, former Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who gets along very well with models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who made his way to the top with learning banking."
But Ospel would have relied on Wuffli until the end.
And Wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, perhaps.
One thing is clear: exuberance came before the fall.
UBS staff clearly remember the executive meetings at which the head of the Wuffli Group always uttered the same slogan: dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She commissioned the "League Tables" rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all, UBS wanted to go to the top.
Some steps have already been successful.
In the currency and securities transactions business it played a very important role.
The corporate advisers, who were responsible for this, pointed out, however, a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the banking jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
UBS would have shortcomings in terms of US mortgage products.
To fill this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
Thirsty for growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in American sub-prime investments that have invested.
It turned into a massive machine that packed and passed valuable documents based on U.S. mortgages — but also retained risk.
Even when other banks had been looking to go down for a long time.
"Still in the summer of 2007, when the U.S. housing market was in flames, UBS bought there," says Geiger, the banking expert.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after another had to leave, when stopping the attempts proved more difficult than we thought.
Positions at UBS have become ejectable and have so far been wobbly.
Whoever runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all suggested business models have disappeared.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: put an end to investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking needs to atrophy, as far as has been clear so far.
Next Thursday, bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was only supposed to be on a transitional basis when the bank surprisingly parted ways with his predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has established himself: he must conduct UBS's business sustainably, the Bank of Zurich announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring investment banking back to the state of progress of the mid-1990s.
It cancels 3500 jobs.
But it won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
Until now, he has only said publicly that he and his wife will look for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.

Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness coming from the banks.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: "It's not yet clear if Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis," he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was too early to invest in bonds from European states and banks.

Smart crows spread in cities
In many places, freux are considered a "bird problem" But experts say that these highly intelligent animals have not been hunted from cities for a long time.
Some like them, some want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Crows have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities complaints from residents are multiplying because of dirt and animal noise.
An antidote to the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts said that it is no longer possible to hunt city rooks.
Experts from all over Germany deliberated on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
Nature conservationists also based the problems of cities on the exodus of particularly protected wines: The use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional living spaces.
The hunting, development and felling of typical brooding trees made life difficult for birds.
Crows are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 brooding pairs in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project gained negative publicity because of the slaughter of crows in this region.
Critics found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with clubs particularly brutal.
"Normal eviction, eviction, is useless," said Leer city and landscape planner Werner Klöver.
Destroying nests with pressurized water or cutting down trees often produces undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals move away, large colonies divide and disperse to other places."
Eviction is only conceivable in exceptional cases such as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We are forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of crowding out animals with aversive conditioning and eye-catching offers, in order to allow them to resettle elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens prospected "info panels instead of chainsaws" in order to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better withstand a pimple on the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-Educational Trash in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing about the lives of these very intelligent rooks.
This project has since been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of noise caused by birds: "That's a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say to each other."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Rooks not only use working instruments to arrive at a treat but they make their own tools as working instruments.
Ethologists at the University of Cambridge were testing four freux recently, how well the intelligence of birds arrives.
In one experiment, birds quickly learned that they had to collapse scaffolding with stones to reach a larva.
Without much practice, they determined that a stone had to have certain size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the clever crows then had to solve a stockier problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not reach their booty with their beaks.
However, the researchers had made pieces of wire available to them.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four rooks even succeeded from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
Hopes of a coup by the Bosniaks and Turks remained unsuccessful.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czechia and also Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czechia, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the qualifiers for the 2012 European Championship in Poland and eliminated Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal lost to Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after the 0:0 of the match, its fifth participation in the European championship.
The Czechs reached the second leg by Montenegro 1-0 (0-0), while the first leg (2-0), had already been an obvious thing.
Nothing was more burning in Turkey's 0-0 draw against Croatia, Ireland took a 1-1 (1-0) break against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other shots for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga Wolfsburg player Zvjezdan Misimovic, with an 11-metre penalty played in hand (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) twice made a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a free-kick from 30 yards ahead into the net.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his shooting skills from distance and shot from a distance of 25 meters to make it 2:0.
The Bosnians, who in the first half hour did nothing, had their first clear chance thanks to striker Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger, the leader of the English championship of Manchester City initiated a headball directed below the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scored a goal for the Czech
Finally the referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding at the center of all attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnia penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36th).
On the counterside, Stark awarded a controversial 11-yard hand-played penalty after a Fabio Coentrao action that Misimovic surely diverged.
But, after the break, the 2004 European runner-up managed four shots and everything became clear.
For the Czech, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go to EM for a fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg), was also lucky and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented with a reflex a last-minute goal by Tomas Sivok potential (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the rotation on the penalty area just off Cech's shot.
After the break, the cross had to come to the rescue of the world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs already shot, once again, the striker of FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed Zagreb's football miracle meanwhile.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to give up his place on the bench of the third of EM in 2002, the Croatians were able to celebrate their fourth round in the final of the European championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the post, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croatians didn't let anything burn.
In addition to VfL Wolfsburg's Mario Mandzukic, who was replaced by Dortmund's Ivan Perisic in the 62nd minute, Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the pitch.
Trapattoni participates in the ME
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took coach Giovanni Trapattoni's side, who had already taken charge of the first stage with a 4-0 win for a preliminary decision, 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalized for the visitors.
Ireland pushed into high gear from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy received the first good chance.
Only at the last moment was Estonia's defense able to prevent a possible goal from the top scorer.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was within reach and squeezed the ball to the line for 1:0.

Personal mass slaughter
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity. Titled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War," it begins with a long list of characters that squeezes your heart.
A tip to start: carefully tear up this page and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people in detail. In this romantic tale by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the mists of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
Here he wrote an extraordinary book that he describes, accurately, as "a work of anti-history."
It features some well-known names, important treatises, or famous battles; There are hardly any ambassadors or discussions of strategies and materials.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a "book describing what it might have looked like." It includes "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and Sorrow" sums up the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women on both sides of the war, from young schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, paramedics and salesmen.
Some will become heroes.
Others prisoners of war. Some will lose limbs, go crazy or lose their lives.
Their lives waver here like candles in a church: while some are extinguished, new ones are rekindled.
Peter Englund's book departs from traditional history books.
It refutes the idea that the First World War can only be summed up by the terrible trench warfare on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" skillfully describes other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are under beehives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; Tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
War invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that reeks of cordite.
When cannon shots ring out in the distance, and you're a stay-at-home mom, do you stay or flee?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been fleshed out by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"Beauty and Sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nanny in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German High Seas Fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other previously published documents.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most address deprivation and the ability to cope.
Telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He goes on to talk about alternative food in Germany.
He describes "meat made of cooked rice crushed in sheep fat (and finished with a fake wooden bone); tobacco made from dry roots and dried potato skin; wooden shoe soles."
It states that "837 authorized substitute meats are registered in the production of sausages. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American acknowledges his own drive for savagery and says of war: "You feel that after all, this is what men were destined for, rather than sitting in a comfortable armchair, cigarette and whiskey in hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than pretending that such a veneer is synonymous with civilization,  and that there is no barbarian behind your stuffed and studded shirt.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is very likely to die, and that no one will notice or pay attention.
"When you are resigned to sacrificing yourself, you hope to have an audience," he writes.
It is unfortunately rather comparable to "a condemned man strangled in secret".
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is increasingly becoming a story of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He grasps the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the bestiary of the turn of the century: the well-articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-tailored clothes, who executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; There are as many basic behaviors as heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"The most grotesque expression is found in the trade in pus due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread over the genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he wrote.
"The most desperate apply it to their eyes, which results in lifelong blindness."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he captures how the war "unleashed exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, an aversion to religion."
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are waging war on them.
The best books dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as Paul Fussel's "Great War and Modern Memory" or Erich Maria Remarque's "A l'Ouest rien de nouveau", rather than complete.
Peter Englund's book is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most damning I've read in a non-fiction work.
I will not reveal it.
But it is as if he had emerged from his book, seized with your hands this page with the list of people and burned with a match.
After a first misstep, a meticulously planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be very empty.
The operation remained secret from all but a few high-ranking officers and others informed from the outset that they were going to conduct an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges facing the Police Department.
There could be no repetition of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which went against the department's regulations and created a storm of public solidarity for the protesters.
The operation to clear Zuccotti Park of its protesters was rolled out after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the course of the occupations in other cities.
A major exercise was held on Randall Island, in preparation for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better anti-riot training — anti-terror measures that involve moving large numbers of police officers quickly — to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders given to move around the park arrived "at the last minute," said one regular, referring to the operation as "a mere exercise."
"The few police officers I know who were called did not know they would go to Zuccotti Park," the person said on condition of anonymity.
"The only ones who know they would go are at the top of the Police Department hierarchy."
The city has learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police wanted to clean up the park but were pushed back by hundreds of protesters informed of the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including task forces from across the neighborhood — dozens of officers accustomed to particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Kelly said many people came and went in the park during the day, like migrants. One o'clock in the morning was therefore an auspicious time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the fewest people," he said.
Emergency service vehicles equipped with spotlights and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before responding.
Lights and recorded messages blaring from loudspeakers appeared to intimidate protesters.
As community affairs officers entered the park wearing their light blue windbreakers, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left.
No tents were hit until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving occupants time to gather their belongings.
Other teams of police officers were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police department chief, said the action was taken solely for safety.
But according to many journalists, the police prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, rudely held by the officers.
Browne said TV camera trucks on Church Street along the west side of the park were able to capture footage.
As police moved west through the protesters' thick jumble of belongings, including luggage, plastic grass and leaf bags filled with clothes, sanitation department crews followed, cleaning up everything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged. The images were posted on the Internet shortly thereafter.
The main group of protesters took place near the camp's kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some formed a barrier that the police moved to arrest methodically.
A dozen people at the epicenter of the camp hung together.
Finally, two people chained themselves to trees, Kelly said.
Emergency services were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until 3:30 a.m., Kelly said.
According to the police, the clean-up operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Browne, nearly 142 people have been arrested in the park.
most for "disturbing public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, Chief of the Police Department, was the highest-ranking officer to be on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also in attendance.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "was not directing operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police officers were waiting along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of any necessary intervention.
Barricades were set up on Cortlandt Street, one block north of the park, as well as on Pine Street to the south.
We saw the police expand the perimeter far beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most equipped with shields, were even seen pushing people away from them.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most vivid actions of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car. Others were seen slashing the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood popped up flying from the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protester were hospitalized.
School aid union sues city for layoffs
The union, which represents hundreds of school aides who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday over unnecessary and discriminatory layoffs. The impact is disproportionate on schools with disadvantaged students.
Lawsuits are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, the 37th District Council, in an attempt to overturn the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees, among the lowest paid in the city, lost their jobs on October 7. Union leaders likened the layoffs to political revenge for not allowing the city access to a health care fund run by workers' groups, which would have closed the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities categorically denied the accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget that closed in June.
One Council member countered, stating that layoffs of school assistants were not specified in the budget at all.
37th District Council officers said they would file a notice of claim, warning the education department that he would be prosecuted; A press conference will be held Wednesday to officially announce the lawsuits in the Manhattan State Supreme Court.
Dennis M. Walcott and the city's Department of Education will be the defendant. The plaintiffs will be represented by eight dismissed workers, all of whom are black or Latino, like most school aides who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the lawsuit and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to draft complaints obtained by The New York Times, the union is banking on the number of layoffs in schools in the city's most disadvantaged neighborhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that poorer schools would lose the most aid due to regular underfunding.
While there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and only a few in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school aides have lost their jobs in Brownsville's 23rd District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school aides employed at Harlem's Public School 36, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuits claim that "This is not a neighborhood of affluent parents who can bring in funds to fill the budget gap."
The budget of Public School 36 has been cut by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each underprivileged student enrollment.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parents' coordinators.
The memo used the term "overrun" to describe the action, although "overshoot" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "sixty-six parents' coordinators were dismissed", and "not only because of overtaking".
Mission completed: Congress reaches agreement on Libya issue
It would finally seem that Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement on Capitol Hill on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It took a successful uprising, the capture and death of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi, and American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision next Tuesday, backed by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the US troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is about honouring the courage of Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It's bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties clashed, as well as with the White House, over the wording of several resolutions aimed at whether to approve the US military role in NATO's mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to authorize the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a large bipartisan margin and never voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill failed, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure to cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
So the U.S. mission remained in a form of legislative purgatory — Congress upset enough to criticize Obama's handling of the mission, but not enough to pull the rug out from under him.
The indecision of Congress has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell to insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The Foreign Relations Committee resolution "commends the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and "commends the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also affirms "the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee or will it divide lawmakers as it did last June?
Senator and Commission Chair Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new draft.
On Capitol Hill, the House is set to vote this week on a constitutional amendment to secure a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly all Republicans in Congress, and some Democrats.
The measure, backed by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment relating to the budget, or any other matter, to get a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other lawmakers have so far failed to get their amendments approved, but not without trying.
Goodlatte's amendment is one of 68 constitutional amendments to have been introduced in Congress on a wide range of issues.
Some are recurring - the same bill proposed in both the House and Senate - and others are slight variations of a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House alone of the balanced budget amendment, and another handful that would "control federal spending."
Some of these bills are identical, but give their supporters — especially new Republicans who want to gild their resumes — the chance to boast of being the "author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act approved last August called for a vote by the House and Senate on amending a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms that members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to lift the two-term limit for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is perpetually proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be struck down if two-thirds of states oppose them.
As eager as members have been to offer amendments, they are not as quick as they have been in the past.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 in the 110th.
The pace has slowed down from the early 1990s, when members typically proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacred but not beaten," says Gabrielle Giffords in her first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot her at point-blank range in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat-Arizona) appeared Monday night on a TV show, sang Broadway's "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover rather than return to Congress.
During her appearance on ABC's "20/20" newscast, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The show addressed his difficult comeback following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling bill.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — and called her recovery "difficult."
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, replied "pretty good."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special one-hour edition of "20/20," aired the day before the release of the couple's new book titled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special traced Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the Jan. 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first weeks, he can be seen on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a large scar on his forehead.
She manages to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sits in a wheelchair as doctors teach her to perform simple actions.
A nod.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: "What".
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") asking to change her breakfast menu.
The videos released by ABC show the important role of music in Gabrielle Giffords' recovery: the Representative is seen singing with the doctors the tunes of Cyndi Lauper "Girls want to Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?".
In the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours with doctors every day, said she did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading her an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and first asked for information about the six people killed in the incident.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri jail and being treated vigorously pending trial.
"There were a lot of deaths," Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
When she recovered, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten."
"So I would say, 'Gabby, you weren't beaten,'" Kelly said.
You just got butchered.
And you're going to get through it, recover and come back stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for the troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in suits and ties stood at his feet to cheer him.
"Military men and women are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fundraiser.
A senior military officer at the gala, which also included Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, saw the role of troops differently.
"They were presented as some kind of orphan," the senior military officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But it was not respect. Just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has developed between the military and a passionate but often distant American public.
Praise is lavished on the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say some soldiers.
The public is increasingly acting as if they feel sorry for the men and women in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way to sustain us is to lock ourselves into the role of unlucky spirits."
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not wish to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of troops returning from the Vietnam War was much worse.
Thus, most conversations about pity take place confidentially among Veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat with the Marines, retired Col. Mark Cancian warned them that the public would view their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect as they have faced insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few interviewers were subtly asking if he would be able to hold on under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after returning from combat.
"When you talk about service, you are confronted with negative impressions," Colonel Cancian recalls when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arose, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Victories are rarely congratulated by a country so unfamiliar with the military and which sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way we did in World War II," said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who led troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people focus largely on the depth of suffering of a soldier.
Troops are recognized for the number of periods of service endured, the number of friends lost, or the extent of injuries.
Army faces growing pressure to crack down on rapists
This week, a crucial hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the military for alleged inaction on rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
Private 1st Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claims she was raped by a soldier.
That was in October 2008. She was returning to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked her if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"It was a wake-up call," says Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texan put aside her concern.
I thought: no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I should have followed my intuition."
Minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man grabbed her from behind, threw her on the floor and raped, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still serving and some not, will anxiously await the court's decision in a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether a trial against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld,  will take place.
They are accused of failing to stop widespread rape in the army, thus violating soldiers' constitutional rights.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs. That number rose to 28 in the following months – 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also allege that the military failed to investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says she is attacking the military because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she said.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leaders."
The lawyer also says that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom may be part of future lawsuits.
Its strategy: instead of bringing together all the plaintiffs in this case – thus putting all its eggs in one basket – it will initiate several lawsuits, if necessary, to keep up the pressure.
The defense team, for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. attorney Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, and essentially the fact that the military cannot be sued by soldiers on duty or off duty for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, known as the FERES Doctrine, the federal government is not liable for injuries sustained by active duty personnel.
"The alleged evil is inherent in the plaintiffs' military service," the documents say.
The Defense Department declined to comment.
Things have changed since the 50s.
While women are still not officially allowed to go into battle, this distinction is only written on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely solely male.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in reaching out to local women.
As a result, in these two wars, 150 female soldiers lost their lives - two-thirds in combat situations.
It's time for the military to modernize," says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three other trials are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Center is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on diagnoses of "personality disorders" attributed to rape victims in order to give them leave – a relatively ordinary occurrence, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network.  a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in the way benefits are processed for people who say they have been sexually assaulted on the service.
Nine independent bills were introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded, according to the Department of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The March report also looks at the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20 percent of cases in the military went to trial — half the percentage in the civilian justice system.
The plaintiffs in Susan Burke's case describe their assault as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the Military Police of the rape less than an hour after the incident.
That night, she said, she was asked to recount her rape 11 times to different policemen, doctors and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and her attacker's blood - due to a cut on her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat before a judge at a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relationship with her boyfriend earlier in the day of her assault.
Six people testified as character witnesses for the perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was announced," Lyman said.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started yelling at the court."
"I was put in a psychiatric unit, and when I came out, I remember telling my commander, 'This was not his trial but mine.'"
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to see a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, rendering her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed on less than honourable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefit.
Whether or not Lyman and the other plaintiffs will move forward is a long story, says John Turley, a law professor at the University of Washington School of Law.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I have always been critical of the Feres doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and deterrents posed by responsibility.
"The odds are heavily against them... But it's important that they try," he adds.
These things change only when the good guys have the will to fight.
If the lawsuit doesn't turn out in their favor, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will gather her hundreds of other plaintiffs for other lawsuits.
"We will continue to fight against the army on this issue as long as there is no reform," she maintains.
Where until we die, either of the two options.
Walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just a guy sharing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to being caught in a killing spree in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, faced his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from it in cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networking sites.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... Log in to Facebook.
"We realised it wasn't that hard to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report by the DEMOS think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of so much personal information, Bartlett argues, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they're looking for with scientific accuracy — the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team discovered that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe. It targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to complete a survey. The questions asked concerned their level of education, their attitudes towards violence and their optimism about their own future.
By reaching out to these people through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without leaving the office.
"It's a new way of doing research," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not at all surprising: the online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be men, young and anti-immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who combine online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens."
The DEMOS study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new must-have tool in the hands of scientists.
Think tanks, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all topics that affect health issues such as social trends, through "Likes", wall publications and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, the "data supernova" is generating a search explosion, increasing the number of searches whose site name appears in the title by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you might not be approaching on the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate people in the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You had to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you in," Bartlett says.
"Facebook avoids all of that — you have direct access to their information."
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social issues.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and colleagues, young students who posted on Facebook about their drunken exploits were significantly more likely to be alcoholics than students who were quiet about it.
Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to possibly help a student whose status talked too often about alcohol.
"You can't treat a problem if you don't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Children's Health, Behavior, and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, says the Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would otherwise not be recognized."
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The site's data team studied statistics about dating status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a national happiness index (thanks to information only available – digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its treasure trove of data available to others for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation they haven't even heard of?
While researchers have clear guidelines for how to collect information other than through the Internet, the situation is quite different online.
"I don't think a lot of users have ever thought about a researcher studying their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, based on a 2006 study he conducted by looking at his students' Facebook walls.
"As far as they knew, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study will be completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user's wall.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two totally different things," Selwyn said.
That's why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notepad and pen are still the best tools one can use.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people," he says.
"Social studies is supposed to address the social aspect – and the social is not in front of a computer."
"Cold and inhuman": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to masterminding the two bombings that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first appearance at the Oslo trial.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Templars of Norway," he told a courtroom full of 500 people.
"As for the jurisdiction of the court, I reject it because you derive your mandate from organizations supporting an ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the facts but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because he "didn't want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a speech on paper, talk to the victims' relatives at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in detention for another twelve weeks, banned him from speaking to the media for four weeks, and warned him that authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About thirty relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he would be put behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found him cold and inhuman," a survivor from Utoya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally advanced a bit after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and exited the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also said there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The July 22 attacks therefore appear to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some.
But this does not reduce the grief and confusion felt by the entire nation.
"I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but that's not the case," said a relative of one victim.
"It would have been much easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview, in theaters this week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford – distinguished by technical genius and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans may find most revealing in a recently rediscovered Steve Jobs interview, which will air this week as the opening act for a film in major markets, is how well this creative mind understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organizational chart improver – a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "disease that makes them think a great idea does 90% of the job... [But] a considerable amount of manual labor separates a great idea from an exceptional product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sits down for over an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it had been about 10 years since Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working his new IT company NeXT, aiming for popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in transport.
It was only after the death of Steve Jobs that a complete video was found in the director's garage.
This slightly edited video is the basis of the 68-minute film entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be released in cinemas next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic about laying out technology philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide an accurate answer.
We also discover moments when Steve Jobs' perfectionism resurfaces, where he seems eager to hear Cringely's questions, nudging him to speed up and move on to questions or topics of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there is a strangely prescient aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision for the future of computing.
It's one thing to read the posthumous evaluations of Steve Jobs' career, but there's something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then implements them immediately.
Here's a quick recap of seven notable sequences from Lost Interview:
On how he learned how to run a business:
"In all these years, I've always asked, 'Why do you do things?' and the answers are always the same: 'Oh, just because you have to do them.'"
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a company.
That's what I discovered.
Steve Jobs goes on to elaborate on his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed as to how costs were recorded - one often starts with a "standard cost" evaluated on sight, then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated factory that guaranteed the accurate calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a trick on the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the story of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack telephone networks and make free long-distance calls.
The device has been the subject of much writing beforehand, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a pay phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We'd wrap the ball in different things half a dozen times and you'd scream into the pay phone and it would happen to you a minute later on the pay phone next door," Jobs laughs.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we ourselves could create something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We didn't know much together, but we were able to invent a little thing that could control big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have ever existed without it.
Steve Jobs goes on to recount a wonderful trick that he and Wozniak devised: he phoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night pretending to be Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go crazy laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On his love of technology (and Bill Hewlett's canvassing):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he looked for Bill Hewlett's number in the phone book and gave him a call.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs landed a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and that shaped my definition of a company and how employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company's research labs, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first desktop computer ever designed."
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode ray tube. I fell in love with it.
The teenager that I was went back to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
At several points in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a whim.
Early in his career, when he was setting up to sell a few printed circuit boards, a client asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working on only 30 days' credit, he had to take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big arguments... I was yelled at and said it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, went out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 that proved incredibly reliable.
On large companies running out of steam:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs anticipated how many industrial executives would get it wrong and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copier or printer, what next?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the business is no more successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [these are the types of people] who end up running businesses and product staff are left out of decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who can't imagine designing a good product versus a bad one – the manual labor required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They snatched defeat from victory.
On innovation as an art form:
"A huge amount of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... As you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are trade-offs to be made... Some things you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling them together.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It's about trying to expose yourself to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring those things to the product you're creating.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists steal.
We are always ashamed to steal great ideas.
That's part of what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply turned out to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas dine with health law opponents as court meets
On the day the Supreme Court meets behind closed doors to consider the issue of political discord over whether opposition to President Obama's health care law will be heard, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were spotted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case in the high court.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges gathered for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases involved a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, indeed, a monumental argument of 5:30 am is expected next March, and the result will probably be likely to favor the destabilization of the presidential race of 2012, which will be in full swing by the time the decision of the court will be rendered.
The lawyer who will stand in court and argue the rejection of the law will likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. solicitor general during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement's law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group dedicated to upholding conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court conference on the case.
Among them was Mitch McConnell, top Republican in the Senate and outspoken opponent of the health law.
The star guests at the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: both judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would no doubt argue by the Canon Code 4C, which states: "A judge may attend fundraisers of law-related and other organizations although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or on the program of such an event."
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm government ethics activists.
"This ethical violation and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court follows the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges were drinking and dining and at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending in court."
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event disproves any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for critics claiming they too easily mix court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Justice Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan served as solicitor general in the Obama administration when the first objections to the law were brought to the trial court.
Her critics have lobbied for Kagan to recuse herself from hearing the case, saying she has been too invested in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing Records Record $18 Billion Order for Airliners
Emirates is ordering 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle airliners, with the option to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at more than a billion dollars.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order looking at 50 of its products.
On the other hand, it is quite a matter when the company in question is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing and the amount of these 50 planes reaches the record sum of 18 billion dollars.
Equally incredible is who Boeing received this order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts released Monday, the Chicago-based airline estimates that Middle Eastern airlines will need 2,520 planes worth a total of $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Over the weekend, Boeing reported on the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle aircraft.
It is the airline Emirates based in Dubai that has placed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Airshow that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more planes, bringing the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8s, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant fuel savings and amenities for passengers.
The amount of these six devices amounts to more than a billion dollars.
"This is clearly very positive for Boeing," said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
"These customers in particular have immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
So not only do they have the means to pay for these planes, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually detrimental to airlines because it represents their biggest costs - would not be so harmful to them since the country would make money from the rise in the price of oil.
This is important because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or postpone aircraft orders when the price of oil rises, Dihora said.
"They have natural risk coverage," he said.
Emirates' order reinforces Boeing's dominance in the wide-body aircraft market and helps curb rival Airbus' attempt to encroach on its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the airshow comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the debut of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is postponing its beginnings to increase its thrust following the request of its customers to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister clearly defeated in Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon says drug traffickers helped her opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the gubernatorial race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost her bid to become Michoacán's governor during violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
Initial results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race for governor of the western state.
"The intervention of organized crime during the entire voting process and especially yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the entire country," Luisa Maria Calderon said on the radio during an interview on the Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election officials... They seized the ballot boxes, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI governed Mexico for seventy years until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But he is organizing his comeback, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have stood out only narrowly from Calderon, who was leading the polls before Election Day.
Calderon, the candidate of his brother's conservative party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently serves as governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the initial results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any links to drug traffickers and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in trafficking marihuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet the violence persisted.
A week before the elections a PAN mayor was assassinated while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections look, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
ADB urges Asia to help eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the eurozone emerge from the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would impede the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the managing director of the Manila-based ADB, said the world's two fastest-growing economic powers must "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) against looking at Europe's difficulties with an "indifferent eye" and warned that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would help avoid a long-term collapse of the world economy.
"We are all together in this crisis."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to a certain extent, but it is not immune."
"So if China and India can help, let there be nothing stopping them."
In recent months, the eurozone has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italian borrowing has skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
Europe's burgeoning sovereign debt crisis has raised fears that the global economy could slip into recession, and prompted calls from major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Nag predicted that the IMF would channel any Asian aid, but he also said that such bilateral assistance - such as buying bonds from the US bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility - offered greater negotiating power to Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India's Minister of Commerce and Industry, said "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone as its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a drying up of foreign capital inflows.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges ahead and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a choice, it's an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help Europe's rich as they face their own significant economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to get Europe to accept aid for India's 1.2 billion people, at least 800,000 of whom live on $2 a day or less.
"One day they will find out that Greeks retire at 50 and go on holiday in the sun and they will have a hard time swallowing it," he said.
Lee Howell, the chairman of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why India's reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek civil servants in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, such as in the rail sector.
Nag said the eurozone crisis was likely to cause "significant repercussions" across Asia.
BASD's forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 now faces "risks of loss" because of the European threat.
He warned that vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop "contingency plans" to protect themselves from an economic downturn and significant capital flight.
Pentagon stern warnings about potential defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta ratcheted up the pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that impending automatic budget cuts would undermine national security. It has set off a financial chain reaction from the corridors of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to the gatherings of civilians.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in cuts for the next decade, but now fears that an additional $600 or more in cuts is imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impacts of these cuts would be devastating to the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said Congress' failure to reach a budget deal resulting in so-called sequestration, would result in 23 percent cuts as well as the freezing of many new projects.
"Such a large cut, applied indiscriminately, would render most of our ships and construction projects unenforceable — you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building — and seriously undermine other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to divest ourselves of a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would almost certainly have to send civilians on leave without pay in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our readiness."
The cuts would eventually affect combat troops, Panetta said.
"While wartime funding of overseas contingency accounts would not be directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by severe disruptions in base budgets," Panetta warned.
"Contractors would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and supervision of contracts that support the war."
"Staff managing salaries would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of sequestration on the Department of Defense would have triggered a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world leader of military might."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was released.
"It's not a consequence we can live with, and it's certainly not the one we should impose on ourselves."
"Kidnapping is a threat to U.S. national security interests, and it shouldn't have to happen."
Whether Panetta's letter and recent warnings from senators increase pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly vocal about possible cuts, even though he himself rose to the Pentagon's top job with years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing he faced tough choices.
At a press conference last week, the defense secretary painted a bleak picture of what could happen — a military man with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers capable of accomplishing the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks to the Pentagon.
"It is a depressed force, ill-prepared and unable to deal with potential adversaries."
"De facto, it invites aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically spelled out how further reductions could "generate significant operational risks: response time to crises, conflicts, and disasters; severe limits on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable assumed risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could go to the chopper, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
That list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new littoral combat ship and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Halting development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but proponents say it's a critical step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look at recent headlines indicates how pervasive deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; Each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering up reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner has come across as an idiot by quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations related to covering up an extramarital affair.
And then, none of the people who lived through history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton unleashed by lying during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories of cheating on school and university tests are legion.
There have been cases where teachers have given test answers to students in order to make themselves look good on their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach otherwise send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we encounter?
On any given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that strangers lie to each other three times in the first 10 minutes of their encounter.
Detecting or spotting lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game like, say, charades, where the goal is to exclaim, "I got you," deception detection is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research into such projects, including psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars look you in the eye.
They don't always stutter, blush, or fidget.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to unmask.
A skilled lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial microexpressions, question formation, and response time.
I have spent several years examining scientific findings in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge about deception, and it is clear that detecting deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful for navigating our complex world – especially if your job responsibilities include hiring,  interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are adept at reading others well, putting them at ease, managing their own emotions, and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more "centered on them" lies while women tell more "other-centered" lies – usually to protect someone's feelings – that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but that the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbeliever, others will feel less guilty for lying to you.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First, observe your subject's normal behavior.
This is called "benchmarking".
This helps provide a benchmark for measuring subsequent changes.
Observe your subject's posture, laughter, vocal quality.
You need to know if someone is normally wagging their feet all the time so you don't make unfair accusations when you see them wagging their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clues to verbal and nonverbal deceptive behavior.
Think of these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceptive people may immobilize the upper body when trying to remember their story, they may point their feet at the door, lean towards an exit, change posture significantly, or present "post-interview" relief – an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change in posture when all the difficult questions have passed.
Interrogators often falsely state that the interview is over just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The notorious Scott Peterson slipped by using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search for her.
Deceptive individuals may also use distanced language: "I have not had sex with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wooden language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... If I remember correctly... to my knowledge."
This makes the response perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing the skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone's chances of avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial pipeline plan will be baffled after U.S. threat of belated approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a proposed Canada-Gulf of Mexico oil pipeline — angering unions while appeasing environmentalists — the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project back on track.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the proposed pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive Nebraska Dunes area, and is confident the project will still win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident it will eventually get approval for a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the State Department's announcement last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives new studies of potential routes to avoid areas of the Nebraska Dunes and Ogallala Aquifer, vast groundwater sources.
"It's a real way forward," Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would likely have delayed any decision until 2013, after next year's election, though officials deny the policy's involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department's decision, and expressed support for it.
The 2.735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it would have to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by task forces, which have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are pushing for legislation to force the removal of the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would pose only limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said the department's inspector general has ordered an investigation separate from the review process, centered on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly causing a young child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that Disco diva Patti LaBelle, who went on a rampage of violence in the lobby of their Manhattan apartment building, terrified their little girl to the point where she vomited out of fear.
The tirade of the singer "Lady Marmalade" frightened the little Genevieve Monk aged 18 months, so much so that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers", says her family during the trial of the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was November 10 of last year as stage technician Kevin Monk, his kindergarten teacher wife, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to go on a family trip.
As Kevin Monk went to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of their building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevieve in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter down for a while.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes' and went to get her," she says.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
"She told me in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't leave your daughter by the door,'" Roseanna Monk says.
"I said, 'I'm not interested in what you say or think.'
She became enraged and began to use swear words - the word "" and the word "" in a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started dousing me with water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Genevieve became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" the child's mother said.
LaBelle threw herself on the mother - who was still holding Genevieve in her arms - and had to be restrained by those around her who dragged her to a car waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she started vomiting, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but received no response.
Counsel and representatives for LaBelle did not return our calls for comment.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and the family plans to donate all the money received to a children's cancer charity.
"The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially towards a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity has held back the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez's administration, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment fell and the economy contracted.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of Mario López Valdez's Government, self-called change, which generated great expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, apart from causing losses of trillions for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic decline of 31.16 percent in agriculture,  which has affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the frost allocation report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there was damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the rest 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables,  corn and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity generated, until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the unemployment rate of the State during the first three quarters of the year there was an accelerated increase, since while from January to March 55,053 Sinaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Economic Active Population,  In the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent and from July to September the average continued to rise to 6.19 percent, a rate that represents more than 74 thousand unemployed Sinaloans, an increase compared to the first half of 18,969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the UAS, the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by public policy.
"What we are seeing is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, among which is the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars illicitly it is not easy that they work to earn them,  that they invest them and use them in something," he says.
Detained migration
López Cervantes pointed out that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the state to work abroad in the United States has been restricted, firstly because of entry difficulties and secondly because when they enter they already have a lot of difficulty finding work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which causes unemployment to rise,"  he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the Sinaloen labor market is aggravated by considering the high level of lack of seriousness that prevails between working conditions, according to INEGI, the 60.38 per cent of the employed population in this state works there without contributing as a worker to any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for the discrepancy for the state are low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Forecast.
The average monthly income of Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, which stands at 7,0035 pesos.
FDI contraction
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, in 2011 there was the largest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June the State's FDI reached 630,697 dollars, which represents a decrease of 87.74 percent compared to 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Economic Development Secretariat of the State Government records a total investment of 17.280 trillion pesos per year, recorded mainly by companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
In view of the scenario of economic contraction, in July the State Government requested the approval of a credit of 3 trillion pesos from the public congress for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the employers' sector, the first year of Mario López Valdés' government demonstrates a lack of management capacity on the part of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Processing Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the State Government.
"The performance of the economy of Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we must work intensively to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we must double our efforts, we had to align the effort of all and especially the good progress already synchronized of this new team of Government, let's hope that next year will be much better",  he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López said that events such as the frosts at the beginning of the year have held back the state's economy and have restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic fluxe is produced by several events, between which frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level e flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close well below the expectations we had",  Says.
Redefining vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers' Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa said that we want to channel the state towards productive activities of more dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that we have worked, we think it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that we detonate the full potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources," he said.
A lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channels the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He pointed out that the current administration has shown advances in the way public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked a lot and the Government is aware of the fact that there is still a lot to do," he said.
Convicted of 8 kilos of marihuana
A resident of Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and fined 100 days for possession of eight kilograms of marihuana.
The Office of the Attorney General of the Republic has informed that the convicted petty trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for health offences, in his variant of possession of marihuana for sale.
In accordance with file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The petty trafficker was travelling in a white pick-up truck carrying a black bag in the luggage rack of the vehicle and in the co-pilot's seat a small backpack where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the confiscated material was made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still in the Centre for the Execution of Legal Consequences of Crimes.
Debts to contributions to works
The social works contemplated in programmes such as Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrantes may not be finished or suffer serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda pointed out.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although the construction programmes have progressed so far, they are in a situation of risk, as the State Government has not fulfilled its obligations to offer contributions exceeding 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He pointed out that in total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They have to provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end they have not given us anything, even if since July they had to give us a part of it," he says, "and we, in order not to record delays, we have started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for an appropriation to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already suffered this in the previous six-year period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to operate and this year we, to be able to access these programs, we had to get the resources to cover what the state had not paid," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the state authorities to provide these resources, he said that they had made the request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
"They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have not given us anything."
The Court validates the "analog cut" in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has rejected the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog cut" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary to invalidate it have not been combined.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree that details the actions to be taken to make the transition to digital terrestrial television a reality.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for not having reached the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as unconstitutional, due to the fact that the regulation of radio and television is a competence reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
In favor of the project voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero itself.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions provided for by it for the digital transition.
The plenary session of ministers also resolved to reject the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Minister President said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures so that the public administration prepares for them.
"I also do not consider that if it did so it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, whose constitutional mandate is the direction of the State.
The substitution of analogue signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years and this translates into better exploitation of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing change, he argued, would postpone the benefits of digitalization, which involves a public interest decision that not only has a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of an entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, encompasses a group of attributions that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive of the State".
He recalled that a large number of countries from all over the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done it through the Executive, despite the fact that they had very specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded in some form the sphere of competence of Congress, because it ensures in the administrative sphere the respect of the laws issued by the Legislature, he assured.
The possibility of a vote-by-vote count is being analysed in Michoacán
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,0074 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Program of Preliminary Electoral Results (PREP) the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, the past 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local norms with the federal reform in electoral matters.
It will be recalled that Michoacán did not approve either its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Law of Electoral Justice, at the same time as the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal deadline for this electoral process to enter into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the time limits provided by the Law of the Official Gazette of the State,  with the argument that he had some objections.
On the same November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the Local Legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state representative for constitutional reforms, because he does not have the right to "sanction or challenge" them.
Asked about the possibility of "voting by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total votes counts by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there are no minutes of the ballot and the countdown in the ballot box file is not at the home of the president of the ballot box; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of votes received in all ballot boxes of the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the candidate who is supposed to win the respective election and the one who obtained the second place in the ballot is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the representative of the party and/or coalition that presented the second of the candidates mentioned.
The total counting of the ballot may also be carried out if at the end of the joint count it appears that the difference between the candidate presumed to win and the candidate of the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party whose candidate came second,  In this case, electoral packages that have been the subject of the partial count will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday around night, and on Monday people will pay their respects and there will be a requiem misse.
According to his family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé.

For her, the lieutenant-colonel had realized all his dreams, she considers that he was at the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, an affectionate brother and cared for his family a lot".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo at a very young age to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe him, for they said he even had a bad truck; But he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopán for the graduation of his relative, for this he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying an aircraft.

Three abandoned corpses, located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before being found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found murdered with shots fired into different parts of their bodies and with the coup de grace, in an abandoned property in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at kilometer 1.5 of road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who passed by this place observed that in the property, whose fence has beige color and café the gate was wide open.
Looking inside, approximately three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals was wearing a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, no shoes; next to him was another with a white T-shirt, with suspenders.
A meter away was the body of another individual with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
The three were lying on their stomachs.
According to in situ data, the three people were murdered in another location because shell casings were not found in situ.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by one organized crime group to the other, apart from a few bullet holes in it and in the gate.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defense made the presentation of 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are considered to have been related to kidnapping, homicide, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to the information published, in a first incident on 11 November in the settlement of Los Alveros eight people were arrested and one who had been deprived of her liberty was rescued.
Three buildings and a cell phone were confiscated; they claimed they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another incident that took place on November 12 at 06:00 hours, military personnel made a surveillance journey in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without license plate with two subjects on board.
While arresting them and conducting an inspection, the soldiers found a long gun, a magazine and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later and after these statements, on November 13 at 14:00 hours one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape when he saw the soldiers.
They are believed to have been buried in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
Italy's new government to be formed on Wednesday
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with Italy's President to present the new government that will face a crisis that has brought the country to the brink of economic disaster.
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with Italy's president on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic disaster and put the entire Eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace said Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano to confirm he can form the government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will assume its post.
Monti said he would present to the president the outcome of his conversations with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former EU commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "framework is now well mapped out," he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normal, while Italy battles a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to levels impossible to sustain.
The new administration led by former EU Commissioner Monti must approve a harsh austerity package demanded by EU leaders to regain the confidence in Italy that had been affected.
Underscoring the pressure on Monti to hurry, market instability put the yield on Italian 10-year BTP bonds above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of Italian employers Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success have been boosted considerably by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which was forced to resign last Saturday by the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti formed.
Parliamentary support
Monti's new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign benches added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti on Monday began consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organizations.
He will finish his tour of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who empowered an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty over the success of the new prime minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of €1.9 trillion, would be too much for the current Eurozone's financial defenses.
Monti said his government would have to persist until future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians would only give it time to implement reforms before bringing forward elections.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist it should be formed only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of Spaniards is superior to that of Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called up from Spain, ten have participated in more than 50 international games.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 summoned participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if we compare the 22 summoned by the two countries for today's Amicale, at 15:05 hours, at the National Stadium of San José.
While the national and European champions, the number one in FIFA's monthly rankings, have a large register of class A inter-selection games, the Habs only have defender Michael Umana as the only one to have all 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the All-Star League and in powerful clubs in the Premier League of England, maintain an intense activity in national league and cup championships and disputes in European cups such as the Champions League.
To all this must be added the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated qualifiers of the European Cup and the World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the other hand, have international experience limited to one area, such as Concacaf, which is considered to be of a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the greatest record of the Spanish selection is that of goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who the previous Saturday against England (0-1 defense in London) equaled the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international games.
Casillas will play today against the Habs and they will set a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's cerebral flywheel, is 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the week before by UEFA alongside the other centenarians of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and Schalke centre-forward Raúl González with 102.
Ready for the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and close to Michael Umana are left-back Júnior Díaz, with 48 appearances and striker Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have surpassed 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
Those who have less. With more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even make it to 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are not yet starting.
Spain's historic scorer is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in his tour to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to perform one of their best shows next Sunday at National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream come true to perform in this country.
That's what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament said, speaking exclusively with Viva, from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American wing of its tour celebrating two decades of work and Sunday 20 will make its only stop in Central America.
On this day will be presented on the National Stadium, from 19:30 hours, next to the Los Angeles group The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in La Nación on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will perform in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I spent in Costa Rica only once the holidays; It's such a beautiful country and I think we'll be able to spend a few days there.
So it moves us to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity the days before.
What is your message to your most ardent followers?
Thank you for staying by our side all these years.
It took 21 years for us to get to Costa Rica; Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time had to pass until this concert.
Some people are already saying that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does it add a little pressure to your visit.
Some of the bigger shows we've put on in the last 21 years have been in the last couple of weeks.
We offered two gigantic shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that it has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to doing it.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends always went surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; That's how we learned it, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you offered huge shows, with a lot of songs.
What do you have planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never performed there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; We will try to perform two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the directory.
What is the reason for this?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can perform more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, that's why it's very difficult to choose which songs to perform each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't performed in a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of why we loved those songs and may have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe how much you've achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don't think any of us imagined that we were going to be a great rock band, and the fact that we've done it for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to share our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together is very emotional.
We love each other and we love making music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go.
Things couldn't get any better for us.
What does it mean to you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of grunge?
It has always been an honour for us to be part of this group of great groups.
We are very good friends with the folks at Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is unusual.
From time to time, a group pops up from a city, but it's much stranger when five or ten bands come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we went to a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw at Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to still be friends with them all and it's an honor for us to be part of that Seattle sound that popped up.
It's also very strange that a group like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that's a lot longer than a lot of bands normally last.
First, I think we are all lucky to still be alive, and second, we all care about each other.
We are all close friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other with each other's music and it couldn't get any better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; However, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure we don't spend too much time touring because it's easy to fall into this game of the big multitudes and people who love your music.
If we do not forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we must respect music and what brought it, without thinking about the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which does not really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and we didn't release a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little and the most important thing is the fact that we are still very good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or I see a picture I think of the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh,  It has always been a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you chose it for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and this one was the band we liked the most, so we can't wait to see what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change Yello Ledbetter's lyrics live?
This one is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He is the one who sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bass player, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first ones I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam keep grunge high despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the ones that popped up at the same time and, if it's relevant now, I think it's wonderful, because it's music worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had a more obscure content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that are described as very obscure songs, even if they can sound a bit positive.
With both, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose to a relative or friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and these songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
I also think that we can also be happy and even like that we can make obscure music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he presents in magpies, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from a variety of conditions, including tongue cancer for which he has undergone four operations and which is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, told Canal N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the remission of the sentence on humanitarian grounds, no doubt, he said that he does not want it because he feels innocent.
He has had four operations for tongue cancer, he has a weight loss of 18 kilos, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in the feet, listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been serving his sentence since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people because of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely during the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to consolidate political ties
An official procession, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and made up of various ministers and patrons, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point in a long agenda of meetings with political and commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans residing in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara, will be "conducive to the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations," according to information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its web page.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with the France that took place when French proxy Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of its ambassador of that European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20, a group of the world's strongest emerging and developed countries, since November, and has been in force with the South American country, since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to rush the implementation of tax exchange agreements to get out of the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
On the trade front, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (TLC) in force since 2004, which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustachioed plumber goes three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month in stores around the world, was designed from the ground up to take full advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile system, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work," said Nintendo's head of press in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for this medium", because until now successes like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesperson argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows for fast and smooth play.
Álvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most expert will be able to make a "second round" to the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an aggressive "D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This foray of Super Mario into the three dimensions also supposes the return of the character to a mobile console, a fact that has not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo winks at the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of success of previous games, which consists in the fact that the mustachioed plumber must traverse platforms mined with peril to free Princess Peach.
Even if I player finds novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom approves Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to answer to the United States for the conspiracy to launder 70 million US dollars.
Thus ends the trial so that Guatemala responds to the request of the northern country which asked Portillo to try him there.
At a press conference, Colom said his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his tenure "he did not help" in any judicial resolution and he had given course to all the extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and grievous bodily harm, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done implies an executive approach after having exhausted all judicial and constitutional proceedings to judge the former representative of the 2004-2004 interval.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving his legal situation in Guatemala City and guaranteeing his human rights.
Portillo was absolute for embezzlement of Q120 million funds to the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the trial that preceded the extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The results of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove are significant: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of a century.
Added to this is the long century of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to take stock in an act celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping people with little training, without work, with drug problems or marginalized.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of leaders of entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the electoral season, showed the unitary nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Next to the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act the former Socialist Minister of Education, Ernest Maragall and the former deputy mayor to the mayor and current eco-socialist city councillor Ricard Goma.
Also present in the great hall of Fabra i Coats were the current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the Director General of La Caixa's Charity, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and so is the current one, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president gave Trinijove as an example to know how to fight against bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-parties, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated 11 of the building's 13 apartments in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance.
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of number 51 Rue Balmes were living has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily abandoned at noon yesterday the building they occupied illegally and where they organized micro-parties that despaired the neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent a recurrence.
"From this day forward there will be access control," the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took away the electrical installation and part of that of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that as soon as the building was occupied, her business dropped by 80%.
The owner of the nightclub mentioned that the invaders of the property were unfair to her, because they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the disco they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure room had to respond to complaints from neighbours about noise, while, according to her, the trouble was not caused by the customers of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants in the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks,  according to the irritated neighbors of the area.
The manager of the nightclub explained that the troubles were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months that he "forgives" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours about this situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP of the city hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had asked last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to finish with the problems of living together and civic-mindedness that it caused to the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were thefts too.
It is in this sense that he added that "we must end impunity and be relentless against the anti-social behavior generated in property".
Also yesterday, the Mossos (the Catalan local police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m. the police moved to number 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed that four people were accessing the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects coincide on the advisability of the convocation beyond the controversy over the fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors opens the debate again on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-'80s, at the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed posters promoting Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in numbers, with New York's Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not orient itself on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park except Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the town hall convened a mega-competition consisting of 16 competitions for all the access gates to Collserola.
A gate brings back to the idea of a park, no doubt.
That is it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appears on its own: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organization and in terms of reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation for all architects in Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme that two members of this ancient caste of elected officials talk about when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the rare opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, university professors, who have presented themselves coincide.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it is necessary to" debate on "the mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the green blocks has not been completed.
"You have to start from the bottom up that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", gave the verdict the architect for whom the title of "gates of Collserola" contains a "lexicon trap": we must not think of them "as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it is necessary to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some perils".
Dangers that derive from "the uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and which had in the area of the Forum "its swan song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of the borders on which one can build.
"To limit something means to establish already the next step", that is, to exceed it.
"We must think of new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can cause real disasters."
Sticking more to the question, Modol opined that, simplifying, the slope of the El Valles de Collserola region "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronat that "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the town hall offers to his corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he hears that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubts" whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("quite a success", he says) that had to be created: "We, architects, should be only an instrument".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because the bases of the competition lack a global vision of Collserola: "We have convened 16 transversal competitions - he says - in the mountain-sea direction, but there is not a longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This means, at least in this case, that he has opted to participate in all 16 competitions.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can shock in the program and definition with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In its opinion, yes, the City Council should guarantee that the strip immediately above that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of facilities that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the legal representative of Casino Red has granted pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal authority of Casino Red pardons him before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded the payment of an economic quot so that the mayor of Monterrey would allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal trial against Mayor PANiste's brother and on 2 September he was arrested and held under provisional arrest for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor's Office 3 of Property Offenses, he was transferred to Detention Center 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State Capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when he was given a second detention order after the Public Prosecutor's Office dismissed the offences of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19 he was transferred to the Cadereyta Penal Center allegedly for blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos; But he spent only a few hours in the medium-security detention center because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial held in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, a capture order was issued by the clerk of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine Jonás' guilt, such as that relating to the collection of 1.5 million pesos from representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing its operation.
On Monday, the representative of the legal power of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek pardon for the brother of the mayor of the region; As a result, he could regain his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the official of the Public Prosecutor's Office attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and which of the associates of the gambling house had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
In accordance with file 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is granted a legal pardon and no claim may be made in connection with the lawsuit against him at a later date; He will not be asked for any reparation for the damages, nor will he be asked for any punishment.
After the hearing of the representative of the legal authority of the gambling house, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, travelled to the prison in the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been legally pardoned and his case would be closed.
He will also communicate the order of immediate release issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air crash in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven people lost his life.
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) has informed that the results highlighted on the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven people lost his lives, indicate that the helicopter struck directly against the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate for flight.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it met the necessary requirements to transport personnel.
In addition, he said that the investigations made in the impact zone do not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In a research it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact was structural.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to transport them.
The floor had a pant of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the moment, the secretary assured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; But the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services assured that the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Major State was operating at cruiser speed and this happened on a soft rising ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal cruiser operation at the time of impact," he says.
During the press conference, the holder of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather:
Reports in the AICM mentioned adequate take-off conditions, and as the aircraft moved towards the boundary area between DF and the State of Mexico there were layers of cloudiness at low altitude.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to cloudy conditions the crew sought an area of lower height and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersal of aircraft remains in a small area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact took place on a straight and lateral trajectory.
The aircraft remains dispersion model suggests that the helicopter struck the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No traces of fire or explosion were detected:
In the scene of the disaster there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of any type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the fieldwork parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9,00020 feet above mean sea level, the ground had a slope that has been going from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he may have disarticulated along his journey.
The information provides evidence that suggests that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful search of an area larger than the encircled area around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which supports the presumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find the obesity gene
Social Insurance is leading an investigation to discover the obesity gene in children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is leading an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people, called the protocol 'Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents' that will allow to have the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, Miguel Cruz López, head of the Biochemistry Medical Investigation Unit of the Hospital of Specialties of the National Medical Center of the 20th Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Investigation and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The investigation invites the population with or without entitlement to present themselves to the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where the evidence to minors is carried out every Saturday from 8:00 am.
He pointed out that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity takes place in the Sports Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Independencia Sports Unit (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the objective of this investigation is to know the components and importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify in Mexican children and young people risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on November 14, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years old, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires related to diet.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their history of family heredity of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that on Saturdays anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics will be applied to all participants (we seek to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in just six years there was an increase in obesity for boys and 47 per cent for girls; with regard to overweight, there has also been a dramatic increase," said the IMSS specialist.
He said the rationale for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country's population is different from others in its genetic history.
He informed that on average, Mexicans have a 65 percent Indo-American heredity, a 30 percent European and a five percent African and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity result in the inability to burn the excess energy that one consumes (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the integral evaluation of the children, which makes it possible to detect whether they are overweight or obese.
He says that the presence of dark folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of suffering from metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes.
The information is managed confidentially, with doctors giving it in writing to parents, who are explained each of the measures and lifestyle changes they need to take to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, sitting most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric intake, that is, the greater consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - meat pie with corn flour wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid blackcurrants
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better yield, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the reports that the pavement were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand blackcurrants each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the asphalt pavement is adequate,  Blackcurrants could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his conference A Technological Opinion on Blackcurrants, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the yield, and consequently, the formation of blackcurrants.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a collection of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, of almost 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees C it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on environmental and temperature conditions, warns the chemical engineering specialist.
The QF researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México in their majority were covered by a flexible pavement, composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Between the more superficial layers is the layer of asphalt, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and subsequently compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it generating efforts, it allows the forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, they would spread better, according to chemical engineering.
On the asphalt layer, he says, we put a last layer called the road surface, made of fine stone, that is, sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt layer and provide grip on the street.
As the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the forces, the road surface also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be cared for.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, as these significantly affect the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the soil gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer and it is difficult for it to come out, which softens all the layers of the pavement and consequently causes blackcurrants.
In the process of blackcurrant formation, he says, the first that spoils is the rolling film and only later is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be cared for at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Researchers' System explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of blackcurrants and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be related to the load of vehicles and guarantee its satisfaction, to avoid the frequent formation of blackcurrants.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow blackcurrants to be repaired easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did Valle's candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna not to obtain the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives her title number 14 of princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the winners' podium, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredits her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico ascended with the crown and the scepter, the department already summons 14 titles of Princess and Melina one to one legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, among which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947),  Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many people ask is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation has demonstrated that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Police Queen and Best Pretty Face of Vogue, titles obtained by queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who won the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the juror's decision to appoint her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "? What was the book that marked you and why? posed by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the answer of the candidate de Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it's a form of culturalization, definitely I think that the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince", it's a pretty deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called 'The Ardor of Blood'."
This answer did not please first of all because of the term "culturalize" and secondly because of not explaining concretely how each book cited had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, what needs to happen happens.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Among the hypotheses launched is that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A journalist from Bogotá insinuated that being the favorite, the ovation and the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best handcrafted costume, and Queen Mother), "it awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she did not shine on the stage".
And this was noted in his first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two parades on the eve of the coronation.
Even though at both shows she seemed sure of herself, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist with the RCN Channel's "Como en casa" (Like at home) programme, said that the fact that Melina was designated a princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most of the prizes during the contest does not receive the queen's crown".
Moreover, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That's why two days before the election international juror Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensitivity, that before starting the Contest are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by his defects of his butt and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected him as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with healthier body, good diet and responsible physical work.
Queen trainer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her fibrosis problem on the abdomen, which in reality for me had not been too notorious, left him points on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine considers that Valle's candidate's mistake was the surgeries she had undergone.
"The surgeries are good, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her asset and she lost because of that aspect."
For this prize, which the National Beauty Contest is awarding for the first time, after the swimsuit show arose a cruel prediction that came true last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo made to Melina so as not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not obtain the crown.
So was the work of the person from Cali who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano.
A typist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of 'Alfonso Cano'.
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, a typist of the CTI of Cali went down in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the FARC: "Alfonso Cano", by confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven typists who work in the local offices of the CTI, this week it was the turn of "availability" of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has worked for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the corpses that were to be identified were located.
In the year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after attending adequate courses, he specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of friction skin, that is to say the palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano Eliazar had been warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that it was suspected that one of them was that of the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to take away the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the location of the corpse, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant of the area, without glasses and much leaner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a sampler and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the supreme leader of the FARC.
In search of the fingerprint
For a typist from Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Fingerprinting is an exact science, with no margin for error, that can be crucial in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses, typists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of those captured.
When captured, many offenders present false identification cards or have no documents.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher said that in one case of theft he had to remove part of the wall of a house, because in this place the thief had pressed his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to take a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the imprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in different robberies," he recalls.
Fingerprints can also rule out or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently a dead man was found with bottles of drink around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a relative may be a suspect in the crime and indeed a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if this does not guarantee that he is the murderer, it puts him at the scene of the crime.
A CTI typist explained that "fingerprints are extracted from objects with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a sampler or tape is used to remove them.
Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the database of decliners, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said the ITC expert.
He explained that it's not all about how you show in the CSI TV program.
As not everything that glitters is gold, not everything you touch necessarily becomes a footprint.
It can, however, be used, if the necessary confrontation is carried out.
'Indignados' defy authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators jostled in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
Many of the people complied with the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
Supporters of the Occupy Wall Street movement defied New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter, thanks to a court order, the Manhattan square, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters jostled in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a judicial order that allows the 'indignados' to camp again in this place, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new stops.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square again, we will move to another place and we will continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful protests," said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray detailed that the response of the "indignados" to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed protesters to remain in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignados' occupied a new park located at the confluence of the Canal Street and Sixth Avenue generating stations, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, owned by Trinity Church Parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police moved there and arrested some demonstrators, although Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization assures that there are centenarians of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders came in support of the members of the movement and tried to intervene on their behalf in front of the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned compound - remains closed pending the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled for Tuesday during which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analyzed.
Some protesters displaced until then carried and distributed copies of this judicial order at that time and they even delivered it to the agents guarding the square, which caused "some small clashes," said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials beat the demonstrators.
The judiciary prohibits authorities from evacuating members of Occupy Wall Street or enforcing "laws issued after the occupation began or barring protesters from re-entering the park with tents or other properties they previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that, because of this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, but warned them that local laws do not allow them to set up with tents and sleeping bags.
The city councillor personally defended the dawn evacuation in Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the demonstrators were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the square because it became "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to harm other people" because "some shops had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"This morning's evacuation at dawn was repugnant and demonstrates that Bloomberg is basically more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, which accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
Occupancy Wall Street officials also said they do not plan to hold "grand actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate the two-month protests, which began on Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas TV special
Alongside Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be released in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a rescuer in "Baywatch", a rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
Private CTV announced today that Anderson, along with "crooner" Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be released on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1 playing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today released footage from the television program in which Anderson, also known for the extensive Internet broadcast of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband at the time, "Mötley Crüe" drummer Tommy Lee appears dressed as the Virgin Mary while supporting a doll representing Jesus in a nativity scene.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently presented part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV's Christmas special also features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is himself not far from controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a 'whore' during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan reborn after earthquake
GDP rises 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral of early March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still convalescent after the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the Japanese country since the Second World War.
Initial estimates by the Tokyo government put material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have eased.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September served to turn the page definitively: GDP rose by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% at an annualized rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also assumes the greatest pace of increase since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and post-tsunami.
In fact, businesses increased their investment by 1.1%, compared with the 0.9% decline in capital spending observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, to use deficiencies to grow from scratch.
Japan has woken up mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable rose a 1%, driven by higher spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo returned to the domestic market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "safe havens" chosen by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the unrest forecasts of the United States, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger divide, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of major technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed their weak results between July and September for the contribution of the yen.
While markets continue their siege in the peripheral countries of the EU, Yoshihiko Noda's government is not letting its guard down.
"We need to monitor the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
And indeed, the outlook is not at all encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said the majority of member countries showed clearer signals of an economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the inflection points of the global economy has highlighted that the main powers are being restricted.
Because it has decreased four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone was even below average, which is in the 100 level, falling eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens fuels doubts again
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but conservatives won't sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premiums triggered and uncertainty reinstalled in parks, Greece continues to become entangled in the labyrinth that leads to the exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek Transitional Government is imposed rather by the demands of Brussels than by a real conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, signalled yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days established in his appointment may be short to apply them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures under any circumstances and reiterated his demand for new elections for the planned date,  that of 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October," Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message casts doubt on his position: "We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything more."
The conservative leader went a step further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the bodies that must release the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to carry out the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by the va-tout of Papandreu's referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not release the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "an unambiguous written commitment as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new government "the necessary elements to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, even if there is no definitive date either.
The Greeks still have a long way to go.
Queen Sofía: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stresses Spain's "preponderant" place in this type of finance
Spain "has reached a leading place at the global level in the role of Micro-finance".
Queen Sofía recalled that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor on the planet with regard to this instrument of cooperation whose "essence" lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V-e World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and, "especially, in the one that aims to reduce to half the volume of people living on incomes below one dollar a day,  to which the "poverty line" is set.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originated during the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women".  the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "achieved a lot of goals" and "we face a lot of challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is envisaged not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the target is that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these families will be lifted out of the poverty line in which they now live.
The impetus in the design of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, Queen Sofía stressed as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work she has known since 15 years ago, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn on the ground about her lending policy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those celebrated in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the qualification of "head of the family" gathered in Valladolid on behalf of the "bank of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofía ended her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
External Affairs Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, she argued that it would be a mistake to vinculate cooperation with developing countries at times of economic prosperity, because it is a "permanent obligation".
Jimenez considered that microcredits presuppose "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not allow it to be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the "excluded people to whom all close the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its doors contaminated with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress on Monday 14 November in Leipzig took place without any real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also President of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially planned on the agenda but was imposed in the autumn, notably to satisfy activists who consider the government's policy too lax vis-à-vis the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Out of 1,001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which Angela Merkel was entitled, at the end of their speeches and, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor - and of the motion - can be summed up in a slogan: the answer to the crisis "is not less Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because 'nine million jobs depend directly on the euro'.
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could lead to changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the EU's control over the budgetary policies of the euro zone countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "in order to give Europe a face".
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Admittedly, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the groundwork has been set.
Similarly, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weight the weight of each country on the Executive Board of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which obviously amounted to strengthening Germany's weight.
Anxious to calm the climate within her party, the Chancellor has multiplied references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl But she has not sought to win her congress either on the backs of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty quick to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention the France.
Except in hollow.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig was at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is sick leave fraud?
After the benefits, the UMP and the government launched the offensive on sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund, and give a speech on the theme - recurrent since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and welfare.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to make savings in a context of austerity, but is no less heralding an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on sick leave.
Firstly with a view to budgetary savings: the government plans to impose on private sector employees a fourth day of waiting before taking charge of a work stoppage.
Clearly, without a specific company agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days' salary, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that is likely to arouse anger, but which would bring in 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And which would be accompanied by another measure, of more symbolic scope: imposing on civil servants a day of non-compensated waiting in the event of a work stoppage (they have so far no waiting period, against three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also raises the issue of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to work stoppages.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are caught, you will refund," warned Xavier Bertrand at the microphone of RTL, Sunday, November 13.
As with other cases, the announcement effects seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of work stoppage fraud.
Since 2002, it has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives, which have mostly borne fruit.
The French are no sicker than elsewhere in Europe.
Let us first focus on the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than €237 million in daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, with 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% concerned sick leave, i.e. 6.2 billion euros.
And therefore 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French experienced an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
Another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken any sick leave.
Another study, this time from the Health Insurance, specifies that in 2010, 37% of sick leave was for less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no more prone than elsewhere to work stoppages.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) fluctuated, in France, between 10% and 11%, against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sick leave fraud represents very little compared to undeclared work.
As for fraud, it is only small.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that checks are systematic on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 carried out for short-term stoppages were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled absences of more than 45 days, there were 11% of "unsuitable or unjustified" cases out of 1.2 million, or 132,000.
In total, 169,000 "unjustified" cases, out of several million employees who have had sick leave.
A figure that represents very little comparison, for example, to that of undeclared work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of tax shortfall per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud to the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to turn its economy around.
This was stated on Monday, November 14, by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, before Parliament, adding that the hundred days given to his unity government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"To continue the efforts to recover the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new fiscal adjustment programme," said the head of government, who delivered his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro zone summit on 27th October will be the "main task" of the new government, because the country's participation in the euro zone "is at stake", he added.
As a result Mr Papademos has forecast that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to around 9%" of the GDP by the end of the year, after having been 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, on Monday gave his support to measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to further austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with MPs from his New Democracy party.
He said he agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, and fighting waste but opposed to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says expert panel
Canadians live in denial of death, says Royal Society of Canada report
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to speak with their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of a massive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts related to various fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
This committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, for a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the outset, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
While Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has spawned a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death."
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, report experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the wish most Canadians have to die at home, 68.6% end up dying in hospital.
Overall, Quebec has the highest rate in Quebec, with 86% of deaths occurring in hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything in the Criminal Code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuses in the application, that is, the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on incompetent or non-consenting people.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, said yesterday in a teleconference, we would find more cases of these excesses precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
Recall that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favor of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of life to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled are less valuable.
As for those who have practiced assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or discontinuing care with a patient, the situation is less clear, say the report's authors.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it be stated in the Criminal Code that withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The expert committee also asks that health professionals be trained in the duty to respect a refusal of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, as euthanasia, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations from other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described as "extreme" the position of the experts who signed the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to the terminally ill.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old could ask for assistance in committing suicide," said Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all the other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
However, "in society," he says, "there are guidelines and constraints."
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the report's findings, calling it a "pro-euthanasia manifesto."
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly disputes the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, namely the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King calls on President Assad to step down
Damascus denounces a "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry offices.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Bashar al-Assad's Syria, which, with the support of Russia, is resisting them and denouncing a "plot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbors, took a stand in favor of President Assad's departure.
Jordan's King Abdullah II yesterday became the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "step down" in Syria, where some forty civilians and members of the regime's forces were still killed.
"If Bashar had his country's best interest at heart, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu deplored that the Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime had ended in failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to neighboring Syria, towards which Turkey is taking an increasingly hard line.
The United States, for its part, welcomed a "strengthening of consensus against Assad and the actions of the regime" in Syria, after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are taking an increasingly tough tone" in the face of the crackdown in Syria, said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of regime forces died in the Daraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said.
Two other civilians died "during exchanges of fire and heavy machine gun shelling in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said the country was "heading towards the end of the crisis".
He also reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its work, which he said was "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not relent", he added, assuring that "the plots hatched against Syria will fail".
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now considering a "mechanism for the protection of civilians" and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also said he was in favor of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime's repression, which he said is locked in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the plan to end the crisis decided on November 2, including the withdrawal of armed forces from cities plagued by protest and the release of arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday called the Arab League's decision "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the plan to end the crisis, while refraining from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time from markets and sacrifices from Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and implement a programme, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussions with political parties yesterday before meeting trade unions and employers today.
It should set up a relatively small cabinet composed of technocrats from outside parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a lot of sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of parliament from one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting the president-designate.
The president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expected Mario Monti to seek a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Monti presenting a shortlist, probably a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying he was "certain that the markets will be patient and understand".
His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but concern has regained the upper hand especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro zone in September.
The prime minister-designate is expected to assemble a team comprising mostly technocrats, although he has stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government should last until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he said.
According to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will win the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti pledged to work urgently and with the aim of Italy "becoming a protagonist" in Europe again.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of balancing the budget in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has notably called for new austerity measures.
The Italian "boss of bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to revive the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot respect the deficit parameters".
Mr Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism", the "professor" symbolising "the challenge of seriousness" and a "different Italy", according to the editorialists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, because Italy must place 200 billion euros worth of government bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, a U.S. NGO specializing in atomic risk said Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents emanating from this UN agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA last week expressed its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS, drawing heavily on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades from the 60s in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Urals), and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the centre to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then allegedly cooperated with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA cites "strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear detonation system "has been aided by the work of a foreign expert, who was not only familiar with the technique, but who, as one member State informed the Agency, has worked for most of his career on this technology within the military nuclear programme of his home country".
Anti-Muslim crimes have increased by 50%
Crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence decreased slightly or increased little, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence perpetrated against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49%, compared to a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and offenses.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3 percent were motivated by racial differences and 20 percent by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes rise again," Human Rights First said, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organization said in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights," said Paul Legendre, the organization's official.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses," he added, adding that this could include improving police reporting on "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the era of the civil rights struggle.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence based on race, color, religion, origin and now gender.
Twitter is changing its platform and more like Facebook
Micro-blogging site Twitter on Monday introduced changes to the presentation of its platform, including allowing its users to observe the activity of those they follow, making its service look a little more like Facebook's.
A new tab "activity" and another "name" allow you to follow more legibly, live the activity of other "Twitters", Internet users whose messages are followed ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This lets you know if they're forwarding messages, subscribing to new accounts, having favorite posts, and more.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to rebroadcast someone else's message, #followfriday to recommend following another user) to the delight of insiders, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the consumer networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users debated with clear "tweets" on the interest of this innovation.
"It's unnecessary, intrusive, and too much like Facebook," @jemb123 wrote.
"The Activity feature will help me better follow certain elements of my Twitter feed," @dannykronstrom sent.
Austria
Inclusion of a budgetary "golden rule" in the Constitution
Austria's ruling Social Democrat/Christian Democrat grand coalition government decided on Tuesday to enshrine in the constitution a budgetary "golden rule" in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible downgrading by rating agencies of Austria's sovereign rating (triple A).
It was Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann who himself announced this decision at the end of a Council of Ministers, whilst the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the maximum 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain.
"If Austria's creditworthiness were only lowered by one notch, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest every year," argued Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is thus responding to a request made by the summit of euro zone member countries in Brussels on 26th October last: the heads of State and government then demanded that the reduction of public deficits and a return to balance of public accounts be included by the end of 2012 in the constitution or in a law of equal value.
The system adopted by the Austrian government is close to the "German model", Germany having been the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017 the structural public deficit will have to decrease each year by 0.75% of the GDP and from 2017 the structural public deficit of the Federal State will not have to exceed 0.35% of the GDP each year, whilst the regional states as well as the municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The aim is to bring public debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
Strong Yen
Noda threatens further intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again in the foreign exchange market if the yen were to continue rising.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose not far from the historic levels that prompted Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen against dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just set a new record of strength since 1945 against the greenback.
But the yen has steadily rallied since then, boosted by buying by investors who see it as a "safe haven" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and Europe's debt crisis.
The dollar fell back below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen mark, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This surge in the Japanese currency hurts the archipelago's exports because it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of foreign revenues earned by Japanese firms, when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), said Noda, who fears that this rise in the price of the yen will nip the fragile recovery in the bud.
The world's third largest economy returned to growth in the third quarter - 1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and household consumption weighed down by the disaster.
But the prime minister said the yen's high price did not reflect "Japan's economic fundamentals."
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", suggesting that no further monetary easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros), raising to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling of the amounts it devotes to the purchase of various financial securities to flood the market with liquidity.
Euro area:
rates are rising, stock markets are faltering
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis is still undermining European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in weakened countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the euro zone, European stock markets are sinking a little further into negative territory on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10am, the CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt gave up 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With renewed pressures on bond yields of troubled eurozone governments, equity markets around the world continue to give back some of their recent gains."
"Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion," said Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, suffering in turn from renewed fears from market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and trading will continue in a narrow corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation has stabilized," said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro zone penalizes the single currency, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is trading at its lowest level in a month and a half.
Around 10am, the European currency is worth 1.3570 dollar, down 0.4%.
According to brokers, it fell after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU's party, meeting in congress on Monday, adopted a motion including the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
Borrowing rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, that of Spanish bonds of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions on interest rates in southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has asked the markets for time to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos maintained that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro zone summit on 27th October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the crosshairs of the markets, as general elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The spread between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new all-time high.
Waiting for eurozone growth figures
In terms of statistics, the France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3% expected, driven by household consumption.
However, INSEE revised downwards the figure for the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1% in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And, it is really the fourth that worries economists the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro zone as a whole is expected at 11am, while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is one subject that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is healthy that an election meeting is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place that nuclear power plays in them.
The debate will only be fruitful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic change will lead to a doubling of the demand for electricity by 2050, unless we deprive a huge part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to compensate for the scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity permanently, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight against climate change, a subject that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case for Belgium, which subjects its own to the need to be able to find an alternative source capable of substituting itself, nor for Switzerland, which just intends to build only the latest generation power stations.
Conversely, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but a few, are pursuing their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, decided after Fukushima to add a unit to its fleet by resuming the construction of a plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, focused on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts the discourse.
The choice of Berlin will result in higher electricity prices, energy dependence aggravated by the increased use of imported gas, particularly from Russia, and a jump in CO2 emissions driven by the construction of gas and coal power plants.
In a few months, all these unfortunate effects are already being felt.
The case of Denmark is worth pondering.
European champion of wind power, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas because of the intermittency of the wind; as a result, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Conversely, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining the industrial base on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would lead to a sharp increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory the fine declarations on the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not show opposition in principle to this energy, polls show.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it leads to a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and makes them very creators of jobs that cannot be relocated.
If the France were to decide to phase out nuclear power, it would be sacrificing many of these SMEs by reducing the 6 billion euros of French exports of nuclear equipment and services annually.
What electrician would order an EPR designed to operate for sixty years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no miracle source of electricity production, any more than there is a diabolical one.
Areva's development of low-CO2 emitting, nuclear and renewable solutions testifies to the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
We France have a Safety Authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing power plants such as the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; It has remained without human or environmental consequences.
At Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human faults caused the tragedy.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident is the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did for the previous two.
The result of this approach and cooperation between French and German safety authorities, operators and manufacturers, the EPR has a design that makes it capable of withstanding such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians wishing to build a power plant, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them the way free to seize leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotion, dogmas and partisan manoeuvres to dominate such a decisive debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy pursued under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various angles - the congestion of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of the France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made the news, the Minister of the Interior (see Liberation of May 23) proclaiming in passing that the France "does not need foreign talent, masons and restaurant waiters".
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
It is that there is a fairly broad consensus on this subject between left and right.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accommodate all the misery in the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on both the left and the right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be deigned to be given to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confines himself to banalities, indicating that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may pay off electorally; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent book summarizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among scholars on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth.  wages and employment in immigrant-receiving countries.
Restricting immigration anemies growth and hurts jobs.
Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may substitute for national workers, especially the low-skilled, exerting downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, working mainly in sectors with a shortage of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors in which training does not follow the supply of jobs.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants mean that immigrant arrivals have a positive effect on the wages and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri has calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in real wages in the long term.
This is without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization, for example, estimates that, in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (revenue minus expenditure) of €150,000 to public budgets on average over his or her lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his mandate, to get the missing growth points "with his teeth".
The teeth in question, by serving to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a precious commodity; It is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember this which, having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would suffice, for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way possible.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little", that this was a facility of thought.
Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become an "instrument of oppression" as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, Enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and first and foremost a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum will have had in this respect the value of a double revealer: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now shifted, and for many of them, the Republican soldiers are no longer firing in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by demanding a succession of national referendums, organised according to necessity and in a dispersed order.
A blank cheque to the absolute European monarch or a leap with both feet into the void of nationalist withdrawal: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cleavers, but a common, rightful, serene and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain or Portugal - and we would no longer know where to stop the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole that bows to the dictates of the markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is being humiliated on the international stage.
There is concern about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is Europe as a whole that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to give back to popular sovereignty the steering of the European project.
Because it is together that Europeans will be able to reduce their debt burden, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The way out of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, except, of course, that we lead to disaster.
After having fought for a long time against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic government.
Either.
But to think so without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by citizens, would be a new folly and a new dead end.
We must take on a new stage in the construction of Europe.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
The Revolution in interests could not suffice.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by building a more politically democratic Europe, a genuine European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let us make Europeans.
"Contactless" smart cards are becoming more widespread
The world smart card exhibition opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card, etc.), to more than 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart.
The most promising segment is contactless technology, which allows you to pay for public transport or pay for purchases by simply holding the card close to a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, up from 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10% of the overall smart card market (6.925 million cards).
Long lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed.
But supermarkets are doubling down.
This year, Carrefour issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards.
To move up a gear, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two major French institutions have committed to systematically distribute contactless bank cards to their customers in the future," said Gérard Nébouy, Managing Director Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices today are equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology essential to carry out transactions.
"They have fallen behind."
"But they should finally experience a real boom next year."
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But banks are taking the lead.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a case for contactless payment.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale, too, said yesterday to prepare the launch of an offer allowing its customers to pay contactless with their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long suspected, the links between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even said that Algiers has now "acquired certainty".
"The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is cooperation," he said, without elaborating.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have uncovered bridges.
Kidnapped from a restaurant in Niamey by AQIM relatives, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day along with several of their captors during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerien investigators were to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the calls made directs to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerien who has spent a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who says he is close to AQIM and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but we should probably wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between AQIM and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect has external financial and intellectual support and that it is increasingly active," said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this "support" had been increasingly evident in the evolution and discourse of Boko Haram or in its modus operandi, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices increasingly complex and of the same quality as those used by AQIM.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of illumined people who are not worthy of interest.
Quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in Hausa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is a quick success.
It is becoming politicized and demanding strict adherence to Sharia law while its activists engage in the fight against the godless central government.
The latter primarily target churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active, increasing attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, without nuance.
The army invests the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf was arrested alive and killed in prison.
From then on, the sect became radicalized and left its fiefdoms in the north.
Last Christmas, it claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram attacked the secure police headquarters in Abuja in a suicide attack, its first.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia via Nigeria is now worrying all security specialists.
While AQIM has invested Mali and Niger, and al-Shabaab's Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready "to share all intelligence".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplism and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
In recent days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have multiplied thunderous statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strong point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans - often unsubstantiated - are rife.
Mitt Romney, the best placed in the race for the nomination of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and to blame them "for manipulation of their currency", a theme carried by an America exasperated by the migration of whole swathes of its industry to Asia.
Too bad if it is to involve triggering a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated foreign policy vision, nearly choked up on an attitude that "flatters" emotions.
He called for a robust but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who is stagnating in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
Like Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran," he boasted.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing the partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best placed candidate, displays an embarrassing ignorance of the files.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop a nuclear capability" – apparently ignoring the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to engage the US military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
This is a far cry from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a foreign policy heavyweight.
The current president's opponents counter that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine when it comes to counterterrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the too hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq, on his prevarications in Libya, thus sticking a label of weakness.
But the attack is not so easy.
The public views Obama's national security record, which eliminated bin Laden, rather positively.
Since Iraq, it has been wary of military interventions that lead to stalemate.
And, by arguing that America must be economically rebuilt to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more just.
Nord Stream, the new gateway for Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, directly linking Western Europe to Russia at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has entered service.
It must supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with a bang.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part, last Tuesday, on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra and fine buffet, in the inauguration of Nord Stream, this new gas pipeline that connects Russia directly to Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned together the steering wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive in Western Europe each year through a first 1,224 km tube linking the St. Petersburg region to the state of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube is to be completed at the end of 2012, making it possible to deliver a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, equivalent to all French consumption.
And there is already talk of the possibility of building a third one on the same course.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project looks like a victory.
The project was strongly opposed by Poland and the Baltic countries.
Nord Stream will make it possible to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding any overland passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to influence Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
This means that the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But this is at the cost of weakening the Europe of energy, since the project has created a breach between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has been able to triumph its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which consume a lot of gas and whose deposits are declining.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically," confirmed François Fillon in inaugurating this pipeline, demonstrating how major gas contracts are as political as economic.
All this explains the broad smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, present in large numbers in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater tube is made of concrete-sheathed steel to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at an average of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the Second World War.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," says Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to multiply measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, as heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, that nothing interrupts along its entire length: no valve, no maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project abandoned it while the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian state-owned company permanently established off their coast.
"In the event of damage, we stop the gas flow in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who have planned the welds to experience a leak every 100,000 years.
The condition of the pipeline is monitored by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
In the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, one meter wide in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
On arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 meters second, it delivers precise information on the possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo any repairs.
The flow of gas is simply ensured by pressure.
It is 200 bars at the start, and 100 at the arrival.
Five companies joined forces to make this project a reality.
The leader remains Gazprom, which retains 51% of the shares.
It was joined by Germany's E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies set up a joint venture, Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to this company, for twenty years renewable, all the gas transmission capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of how much gas is actually transported," Müller said.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline was provided 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach €7.4 billion for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to pay for themselves, since only Gazprom bears the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic at Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the exit door of the gas.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specifics of incoming gas before it is transferred to German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Created fifteen years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing.
It has a scent of adventure, of hours spent writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, elastic, off-white leaves, as if aged by time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, was in charge of launching the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin (mole skin) which refers to a varnished cotton used to cover benches for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the twentieth century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
The success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million pieces sold.
This is a far cry from the confidential production of the early years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond Italy's borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a robotic portrait of the buyer, because the notebook seduces the businessman as well as the student and the professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which started with 12 employees, now has almost 100 employees and has had two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks in bookstores, from Fnac to small shops in the city center and has been able to impose its identity.
"We have kept pace with the times and this new need for writing, despite the rise of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, she also launched a leopard blanket at the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products: bags, diary, pens, computer cases... The brand is available on a whole range of supports.
In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why does the unemployment rate for disabled workers remain so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th Disability Employment Week opens today.
Despite a proactive public policy implemented in 2005, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared to 9% for the population as a whole.
Discouraging?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, executive director of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled. "
"The progress made over the past fifteen years has been considerable."
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
"However, much remains to be done."
It must be said that for the unemployed with disabilities, there are still many obstacles before accessing employment.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the baccalaureate and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with an average of 38%.
In short, so many criteria that singularly complicate the return to employment, and which "constitute the crux of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, director general of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the objective brakes.
There remains the unspoken, the mentalities that evolve, certainly, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité indicated that the managers interviewed have "a low level of knowledge of disability", with an "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, psychically or intellectually deficient".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, set in a law of... 1987.
The latest available figures, from 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, director general of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The proof: the number of "taxed" establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
" But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially in large groups. "
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What happiness"
Before facing the Blues on Tuesday night (20:45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that gives them this friendly match.
We will not go so far as to write that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have indeed made peace.
Five months after his striker's moody gesture against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
"I'm very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he's Belgian."
"I want to move forward," says the Lillois.
As for the contrast between his performances in club and selection, "it's a whole, he justified."
"In Lille, I'm there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to get my bearings."
Spared against Romania on Friday night for this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shine".
Without omitting the notion of "pleasure".
The Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a supporter," he says.
Inevitably, this contributes to further strengthening the "special" character of this meeting.
Especially since opposite, "there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", he recalls.
"We crossed paths just now."
"Being able to play against them is nothing but happiness!"
Leekens, for his part, spoke of "pride".
"Pride" to play "a gala match".
"Proud" also to note - as a "neighbor" - that the France has "become a very high level team" a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a great job," he enthused.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would see himself sharing the plane with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are getting big," he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll find out in the next games." The one against France included.
Portugal very confident
Paulo Bento's Portugal begins with great optimism its return play-off against Bosnia (22:00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first leg, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento can already see himself there, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, of which he has been at the helm since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to debunk.
In view of the first leg (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the games are not done.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, certainly, but they were unable to score that precious goal, which would have relieved them.
"It's a good result, but it carries a certain risk because we didn't score an away goal."
But at home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there as boiling, even if the game obviously promises to be "very tight", dixit an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We are expecting a very close game, but we are quite confident that we can get the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
Friday's draw from Bosnia forced the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it carries a certain risk because we didn't score an away goal," Bento said.
"We will play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the outset so as not to "give them time to think."
A good idea, provided you are realistic this time.
