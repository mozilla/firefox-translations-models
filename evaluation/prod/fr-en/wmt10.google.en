Barack Obama will be the fourth US president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth US president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The diploma, medal and check for $1.4 million will be awarded to him, among other things, for his exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration between nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and will have a busy schedule.
He will first go to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the very first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October from among 172 people and 33 organisations.
The planning of the presidential couple then provides for an interview with the King of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will culminate in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth American president to receive it, but only the third to be awarded the prize in the Committee&#39;s own chambers.
The White House gave advance notice that Obama would speak about the war in Afghanistan during the award presentation.
The president does not want to avoid this subject because he is aware that he is receiving this award by being a president who is fighting a war in two countries at the moment.
He bolstered the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to point out.
During the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check for ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 1.1 million Euros).
He intends to donate them to charities, but he has not yet decided which ones.
His busy program will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at this award at first.
He mentioned for example having the feeling of not fully deserving it.
He also repeated several times that this is not a prize for him alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
Upon the announcement, he said it would be a &quot;call to action&quot; for him.
Conservationist accused of blackmail
The Litoměřice police have charged the president of the Litoměřice Society of Nature Conservators with blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for various construction site procedures and demanded money from investors for his personal benefit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokeswoman for Litoměřice police.
The president of the Litoměřice Society of Nature Protectors is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting dumpsters are not scented in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their drinks packaging, while in the villages of South Moravia you come across sorting bins on every street corner.
And in Brno?
There, you would have to take several minutes before finding the right dumpsters.
I don&#39;t mean that we wouldn&#39;t sort waste at all in Brno.
But I have the impression that the municipal councilors of our city, the second largest city in the country, do not pay enough attention to this problem.
Brno is in the stone age of sorting waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially given the number of skips dedicated to this waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city center?
It&#39;s a whole science, which requires above all time and nerves of steel.
The only place I have found so far is Moravia Square in front of Potrefena Husa.
Don&#39;t mind Mr. Onderka and his colleagues, but that doesn&#39;t seem like much to me.
Not to mention the fact that in other areas of the city it&#39;s not easy either.
Finally, many of my friends do not sort their waste.
By laziness.
It makes them a trot to get to the dumpsters.
It doesn&#39;t surprise me from them.
Myself, after a party, I offered to go throw a few glass and PVC bottles.
Except that I didn&#39;t see any colored dumpsters on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately I found the right place by going to take the tram.
That said, the trash was overflowing.
It is after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the city best, right?!
It is probably that ecology and a so-called aestheticism do not interest the socialists of Brno too much.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first hockey league which puts the city to shame in the whole country, instead of buying a few more dumpsters and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I&#39;m happy to have been able to back up my impression with official statistics after lingering on the internet for a while.
According to data from the EKO-KOM company, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravian region.
Paroubek&#39;s budget took money away from pensions and sick leave
After the left has risen, despite the advice of the government, farmers or civil servants, there may be a lack of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on state debt or international legal proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says finance minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were basing it on the fact that the government would take out loans for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. &quot;It&#39;s just postponing problems, undermining the ground,&quot; Janota said.
It should be known that on the money borrowed the interests to be paid are more and more high and that it will have to be restored sooner or later.
The state has no real choice as to where to draw money from.
If he doesn&#39;t cut welfare or his spending, he will have to raise taxes.
To all those whom the left has currently increased: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and should not fear for their pensions or their health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of greater state indebtedness - next year there will therefore not be a shortage of 163 billion in the coffers, but more.
Despite Minister Janota&#39;s efforts, the debt will grow faster and faster and with it, interest-related expenses.
The State will need money to repay it and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
It will also miss five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways because of the transfer of money to some groups of voters.
These are mainly sections that have already been decided on and started, and it is not possible to modify the projects in order to reduce costs if necessary.
At most keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major projects, and the collection of European funds is also in danger, according to the warning of Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has offered to solve the financial deficit very skillfully - it will draw from the dividends of the ČEZ (supplier and distributor of electric energy), which the state owns for the most part, and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is in no way a bottomless pit.
Last year, 18 billion were navigated from the ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, the dividends are used to pay for the elimination of ecological damage, to supplement the pension accounts or even serve as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
Furthermore, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GNP under EU rules.
And this is far from the end of the carnival of transfers.
The budget for various compensations to the victims of communism and crime, even housing savings, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without this money.
It&#39;s a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, notes Janota.
The minister will then have to economize on the side of the department or, in the worst case, touch the budgetary reserve of the government.
One hundred million is also missing from the two billion state fund project, which should make it possible to track online what are the expenses of each administration.
The first stage will start in January.
If the Minister of Finance does not find money elsewhere, the project will have to be stopped and sanctions will be imposed, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans envision a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed look promising.
All it takes is a button and you go from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which mainly deals with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them into personal and professional
Both will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and it was first demonstrated a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is by no means a fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists of a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
It is a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now working with European and US carriers to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to the devices sometime in 2012.
The shortage of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Deserted slopes are not just a problem for ski lift operators.
The lack of snow is deterring people from booking their ski holidays at hotels and guesthouses.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Internet users browse the offers, ask for the prices but do not dare to commit to booking for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas,&quot; said Martin Jandura, operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in Špindlerův Mlýn, you better not hesitate to book.
If one prioritizes savings and the quality of accommodation only comes second, then one can try to wait a few more days.
Špindler hoteliers are currently only offering one-week New Year stays.
I think they will try for a while to place them, but they too will give in and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease,&quot; Jandura said.
The Ingtours del Vrchlabí tourist agency also still offers free beds for all winter periods.
Christmas week interests us the most at the moment, it is not completely sold out.
There are still, say, half of the rooms available in our offer.
That&#39;s why we have already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas breaks,&quot; said Ingtours manager Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourist agency can also offer New Year&#39;s Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February start just as well, the remaining winter stays sell out moderately.
This year, the interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for it to start falling.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas will also be sold out,&quot; Schiefert thinks.
Conversely, the occupancy of the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last places left for the New Year and for Christmas.
There is great interest during the January holidays from Poles and February sells well too,” informs Karel Rada, manager of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central car park in Jánské Lázně is also eighty percent full during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the newest hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupancy at present.
February is a little weaker for the moment but as soon as the snow falls, the interest for stays in the Krkonoše will certainly increase again, indicated the director of the Omnia hotel, Erik Sporysch.
However, Krkonoše hoteliers should not expect more snow.
Thursday will be cooler and if there is precipitation, it should be snowy in the mountains.
But afterwards the weather should warm up, informs Jiří Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United States: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It even becomes comical, the assiduous effort with which Barack Obama, president with a reputation for wisdom, reproduces the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, which he himself considered quite simple.
When he finally leaked his long-awaited doctrine, it turned out that he had copied it on carbon paper from Bush&#39;s Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not content with using the expression &quot;as in Iraq&quot; several times in the text itself, he did not hesitate, what is more, to use the title of Bush&#39;s January 2007 speech as the title of his own speech: &quot; A new road ahead&quot;
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush&#39;s idea of sending new reinforcements to an Iraq consumed by civil war as &quot;irresponsible and a decision catastrophic in its consequences.&quot;
The following months, however, showed that Bush&#39;s strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of campaign commanders, was the only one possible and likely to succeed, to such an extent that the newspapers today do not mention Iraq at all.
This did not improve Bush&#39;s reputation, though, objectively speaking, he left his successor with a much more favorable final situation than one could hope for.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
It was again the campaign commanders who asked him for an increase in the military contingent, in particular the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the reluctance of the White House despite habits of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men in order to be able to make the situation more favorable.
The president hesitated for three months but for lack of a better option, he at least cheated the general out of 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to squeeze out the promise of another 5,000 from Europe, even though he had originally counted on 10,000.
What causes the most problems in Obama&#39;s whole strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete this whole process within three years. All of Obama&#39;s doctrine raises more questions than it answers.
Many doubt that an increase by half will bring the same fruits as the increase in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor agreements.
The Afghan situation is the exact opposite - no one can be trusted and no treaty is honored.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing leaders from day to day according to what suits them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only window dressing behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
Balancing the interests of various ethnic groups is singularly complex given the lack of clarity on the relationship, which is further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a &quot;ready to act state&quot;, which is the basic goal of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama&#39;s strategy is perplexing because of its voluntarism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only gotten worse and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and unrealistic heart can be persuaded that the little soldiers sent into the tumult of war for their &quot;soon to return home&quot; will bring about a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will consider it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the will of Europeans to take part in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
European politicians neither know nor want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the development of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the reinforced sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans will find themselves faced with the very difficult question of resolving the problem through the use of military force.
It will have to be answered, for example, at a time when, according to Obama, America will come to a successful withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Each such solution will, however, lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for him to work out a new strategy, in case this one turns out to be a complete fiasco. .
Goldman Sachs bank executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior executives at US bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced it in response to strong criticism of its pay practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive shares instead of cash, which they cannot resell for five years.
The shares may be withdrawn from the managers in case they take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of the effort to link rewards with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I guess Wall Street is well aware of the global meaning, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs bank has come under fire after setting aside nearly $17 billion for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will probably exceed 20 billion dollars despite the measure announced today, according to the Reuters agency.
With the onset of the financial crisis, high premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intends to apply a one-off fifty percent tax on bankers&#39; bonuses over £25,000.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics
Five women, a record number, received today in Stockholm from the hands of the Swedish King Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel Prizes in technical disciplines and in literature.
Besides the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry prize was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath along with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for elucidating the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with her compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have a winner this year was physics.
This prize was awarded today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of fiber optics and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical telescopes .
Each laureate received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the pecuniary award.
This reaches ten million Swedish crowns in each category. (about 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward between them.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize was already awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to US President Barack Obama.
The latter, in his speech, acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward since he is only at the beginning of his career and he is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In defense of his politics, he added that in certain situations war is essential to obtain peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is weighing his stay in government with his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is believed that the budget and possibly also Janota&#39;s position in the cabinet will be on the agenda for their meeting on Friday.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further deepens the crisis in public finances.
Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat informed about the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his position on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget which will be submitted for the signature of Klaus, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday validated the left&#39;s proposals for money transfers and increased the remuneration of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the Social Democrats&#39; proposals for the fact that they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other, a disagreement which calls into question the future of the cabinet of Fischer which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics say the budget, as passed by MPs, removes the package of savings measures passed by Fischer&#39;s government which they say should stem state debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the state budget law but does not have to, said today in a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs that politicians have long overlooked the &quot;serious problem of the &quot;unstoppable deficiency&quot; of public finances.
At present there is, according to him, no favorable solution.
Only a strong government could bring about an improvement, if it could rely on a broader political party consensus, according to the president.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek said the budget is appalling and the government should question its future existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by ČSSD, ODS and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer called such words &quot;drastic verdicts&quot;.
ČSSD leader Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the deficit in the budget prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is staggering and will exceed 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the ČSSD called the ratification of the state budget for the next year a success.
The People&#39;s Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman to Play Mandela in Clint Eastwood&#39;s New Movie
Despite criticism that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus - Undefeated will expose a lot about the country, its struggles and its victories to the world.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman plays the film about the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said he was asked by a ninety-one-year-old Mandela to play him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, &quot;If I&#39;m going to play you, I should be able to see you personally.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who won an award for his role in Clint Eastwood&#39;s boxing drama Milion Dollar Baby, for example, played the leader of a movement against the slave-turned-slave, a fictional US president, even God in the movie Evan Almighty but never someone still alive and as important to so many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was imprisoned for 27 years for his tireless work for the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became the country&#39;s president for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning unconquered and it is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and South African rugby captain Francois to unify the country. Newly elected President Mandela knows his country is still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world rank.
The South African team would eventually progress to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela&#39;s story to the big screen.
I had no other goal but to play this role in a way that brought it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was of course to speak like him
The actor said if he and the international politician were in the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be backstage before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake her hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I pick up some of your energy, it gets transmitted, and I felt like I knew how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a tough role in rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I rang the doorbell, he let me in and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: &#39;I look much taller in the film&#39;.
Despite the differences between the actors and the real-life models, director Eastwood&#39;s Invictus has received positive reviews and there&#39;s even talk of Oscar ambitions.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety newspaper summed up his appreciation with these words: &quot;It&#39;s a very good story, a very well made film.&quot;
In film ratings on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive ratings.
Norway Aura Mystery Solved: Russians Tested Rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin has been observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense only admitted yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was again a failure and the &quot;Bulava&quot; type missile which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army is gradually becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence during the tests of the rocket did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, Bulava either didn&#39;t fly, or it got damaged in mid-flight.
Russian newspapers speak of &quot;Bulava&quot; as the &quot;missile that does not fly&quot;
A missile that does not fly but shines
This 13th test was proceeding normally at the start.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was again damage to the apparatus.
It was obviously the engine of the third stage of the rocket that exploded.
This time &quot;Bulava&quot; flew from the Dmitrij Donskij nuclear submarine, which sailed under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be precisely fired from a moving boat and submerged
This is the reason why the mysterious light over Norway caused by a precisely unidentified flying object was presumably by a faulty &quot;Bulava&quot;.
Moreover, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, one cannot absolutely speak of failure.
The two first stages of the rocket resisted and the damage affected only the third.
In the previous cases, the engines experienced failures on the first stage.
Although none of the test launches went off without a hitch, the management of the Ministry of Defense considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and therefore they always claim that one day &quot;Bulava&quot; will fly without problems and even carry ten hypersonic nuclear cores with a total weight of 1.15 tons. .
The legendary Fetissov has signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at 51
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will feature again in a professional match at 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will lend a helping hand to his needy CSKA Moscow side and will probably make his debut in Friday&#39;s game against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash&#39;s injury we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to settle some details on the form, says club coach Sergey Nyemchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will concern only one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemchinov said.
According to AP, in the event of his return to the ice, Fetissov thus becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford and had 15 goals and 26 assists.
The eldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union he twice won gold at the Olympic Games, seven world champion titles, he triumphed at the Canada Cup as well as at the world junior championship.
In the second part of his career, he also reaped homage in the NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has listened to the unions and is canceling all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
Hyundai factory spokesman Petr Vaněk confirmed this.
However, the management still wants to agree with the unions on a working Saturday again this year.
We cannot give up on our production plan, it is essential, that&#39;s why voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday December 19 knowing that there would be two teams, said Vaněk.
The Sedmička.cz site indicated that the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of Saturday&#39;s team.
It will also be awarded a posteriori for the day worked on November 28.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way of motivating its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for the extra hours, or they can take a replacement holiday on December 28 and thus extend their end-of-year holidays, Vaněk said.
In addition to this, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and for their lunch.
Considering that overtime was the most urgent and hot topic in the comments and demands of both unions and employees who spontaneously ceased production last week, management took the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, said Vaněk.
Until last week, workers at the car factory were forced to work two hours of overtime almost daily in addition to their eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the state of strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the management of the car factory and the unions is due to take place on Friday afternoon.
Union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to end the state of strike if their demands were agreed and a joint document signed.
The situation at the factory came to a head last Wednesday when nearly 400 workers spontaneously went on strike over incessant overtime.
They were also protesting against poor pay conditions and alleged hazing.
The management defended itself with the fact that the employees had to work in addition to fulfill the imperatives in terms of automobile production.
When the strike was announced on Monday, the unions also demanded that employees who had stopped production should not be subject to any sanctions.
The unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a compensation of 5,000 crowns (approximately €209) for them.
The Hyundai car plant in Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started mass production last year in November.
It has manufactured about 80,000 vehicles up to September this year, having a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on &quot;enduring&quot; HIV viruses too
A team of Czech and German scientists are testing new combinations that can slow down the proliferation of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality, in some cases, takes precedence over the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at present.
We can nevertheless radically prolong the life of patients via a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption leads to a series of side effects.
In addition, the repression of this multiplication has the effect of developing what are called resistant viruses on which the drugs no longer have any effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT in Prague and the University of Heidelberg is paving the way for a way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarboranes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers&#39; work leads them to discover new &quot;improved&quot; substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bonds to the proteins of the virus.
Metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are formed by the atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon and joined by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the splitting of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If you stop the HIV protease, you will also stop the spread of the virus in the patient&#39;s body, explain the researchers in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic link, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in test tubes as well as on its resistant variants, obtained from patients infected with HIV.
On the common version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however it does not weaken on resistant versions against which common drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications are therefore interesting combinations to be further investigated to move towards drug development. effective against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, director of the structural biology laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over the budget. The ODS attacks Fischer, who defends himself
The President of the ODS (Civic Democratic Party), Mirek Topolánek described the approved budget for the following year as &quot;appalling&quot; and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The prime minister called the ODS&#39; remarks a drastic verdict.
He says he takes time to analyze.
ODS spokesman Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the head of the government should decide whether he takes the support of the minority in the Chamber of Deputies who are concerned about fighting the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned about remaining in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the ODS and the social democrats with regard to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday ratified the budget for the year 2010, with however the proposals for modifications up to 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The Chamber increased money for civil servant salaries, running social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government&#39;s grievance against the Social Democrats&#39; proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the room before the vote, thus obeying the wish of the government that a modified budget is a less bad variant than an interim budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a feeling of uselessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer indicated that the government will further reflect on the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota were to threaten to leave office if the proposed amendments were ratified, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment with the prime minister on Monday after his stint in government:
He indicated at the same time that he was wondering if he was going to stay in office.
His disappointment with the negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, who imposed the budget changes, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other deficit-increasing laws such as those affecting health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the law on services.
Topolánek: The ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the business of the head of government Fischer and of the whole government.
The ODS-appointed ministers did nothing detrimental, Topolánek stressed in a text statement from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of certain ministries claim to belong to TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas pointed out that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of waging a fight against the amount of the deficit in public finances, &quot;it is completely logical and correct that he is basing himself on the majority of the left which is currently in bedroom. &quot;
That said, he should not expect support and tolerance from the Democrats.
I haven&#39;t thought about it and once it&#39;s on the agenda then I&#39;ll devote myself to it, Defense Minister Martin Barták, elected to the government precisely by the Democrats, told reporters from the Chamber.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a European Council debate in Brussels.
The ODS backtracked at the Prime Minister&#39;s request.
Nečas underlined at the same time that the ODS would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not expressly asked the Democratic deputies to allow the vote on the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not little children, he reacted to the question of whether the ODS had not been criticized by the president of the Party in the House or in the country when negotiating the budget.
I did not notice that my vote would have been missing.
I already knew when I resigned from my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a bolshevization of the Chamber and a destruction of all that was positive, reacted Topolánek in person.
According to the new timetables of the ČD there will be fewer trains for the same fares.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit from December 13 certain express or regional trains less loaded and on the contrary will reinforce certain others.
Total transport coverage will drop on the day the new timetables come into effect by two percent compared to today.
Most fares will not change, including base fares and reduced fares.
It is for example the inhabitants of the Ostrava region who will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino train.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the direct Prague - Letohrad line will be drastically reduced.
At the regional level, the biggest reduction in transport concerns the region of Hradec Králové by a total of eight percent, on the other hand Prague and its surroundings can be pleased with an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also canceled and the circulation of some express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the biggest changes can be seen the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the time being the inhabitants of Milovice have to change at Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
Distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague Main Station (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava, and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will depart at two-hour intervals.
Travelers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from December 13.
The bill this year for the regional railways: an additional 200 million crowns.
The express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways next year a total of four billion crowns to settle visible losses, the same sum as this year. The regional trains are ordered by the regions which will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the State will contribute up to almost three billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have newly signed a contract for ten years, until now the duration was always one year.
The railways appreciate the system, which also explains why they have not resorted to a price increase for the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will only affect ČD Net day tickets and eLiška discounted internet tickets.
For travelers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will now depend on the route taken, whereas until now it was valid between cities in a region of your choice and was at a single price of 160 crowns.
Filipino rebels still holding more than 50 people, children released
Rebels today abducted 75 people in the southern Philippines, including some primary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency which informed about it, but which originally spoke of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that around 19 rebels used the hostages as human shields while fleeing from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to reach an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People&#39;s Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police first pursued the kidnappers following violence caused during a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law has been declared in the province of Maguindanao in the southern Philippines due to a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre linked to the governor&#39;s administration elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province in the southern Philippines was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
South Africa&#39;s history concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood&#39;s new Hollywood movie is coming to US theaters in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrates part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world famous apartheid fighter went to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to play him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion has been attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theaters, the feedback from critics and the public is heard.
Nelson Mandela
From his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of thought, in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside de Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes since it is presented at a time when on the one hand South Africa is in full preparation for the football world cup, and on the other hand because the media are agitated by worrying news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, reactions to the new film have so far been rather positive in South Africa, despite frequent reservations about the main roles in which Hollywood stars &quot;strut&quot;.
Morgan Freeman is nonetheless, in his own words, proud of the film.
I dreamed of this role for many years and I prepared myself well.
I also met many times personally Nelson Mandela to be able - as they say - to recover his energy, he indicated during the official premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it&#39;s a good thing if we can remember Mandela&#39;s personality and message through the film.
This is the story of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual, he added.
Wear the national rugby team jersey
The film based on the story of the novel by British writer John Carlin the title being loosely translated. In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Play That Gave His Creation to the People portrays the South African human rights defender during his tenure as President.
Morgan Freeman therefore tries during the film to put together two racial groups of a long divided population and just like Nelson Mandela in 1995 he enters wearing the national jersey of the South African team on the lawn of the World Cup, that Africa du Sud had won then.
For showing himself on the lawn in a jersey, which is considered sacred in South Africa, Mandela had received a long standing ovation fourteen years ago, mainly from the white public, and was recognized by the white populations.
Hopefully the football championship will succeed in uniting people again into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only &quot;black&quot; member of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense South African situation will improve.
White South Africans are skeptical, however, as Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain, recently confided in an interview for LN.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the region of Louny
A fire engulfed a transformer of the Čeps company in the distribution center near the municipality of Výškov na Lounsku in the morning.
According to Lukáš Marvan, spokesperson for the Ústí fire brigade, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer burn itself out, but they changed their advice and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal transformer short circuit.
No one was injured and according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandátova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission assembly.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure will be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced with a new one.
She adds that in ten years of activity, the Čeps company has not experienced anything similar and that incidents of this type are isolated.
Electric power supplies were not interrupted, says ČEZ company spokeswoman for North Bohemia Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the functioning of households, administrations and industries was not influenced by the fire from the transformer station.
As Čeps is the exclusive operator on Czech territory of transmission sets and power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution substations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from transmission sets to distribution sets and line routes with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jančura will file a complaint for defamation against three ČSSD prefects
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will file a defamation complaint today against three social democrat prefects.
And specifically against Michal Hašek from the South Moravian region, against Radko Martínka from the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned this in Dvacet minut from Radiožurnál.
The complaint relates to the company&#39;s attempt to operate regional railways in certain areas.
However, all regions ended up signing long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three attacked us and claimed that we were choosy, when we only made an offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech Railways which is not true as we know the prices of Czech Railways which was signed last week.
So we just have to defend ourselves.
This is in exchange for the slander on the Student Agency society, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
Likewise, he indicated that he had evidence that no region had proceeded in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for this to the European Commission.
Hašek considers that Mr. Jančura&#39;s filing of a complaint represents the continuation of his media spectacle which serves as free publicity for his company and for his person.
I am of course prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I guess this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr. Jančura who is manipulating public opinion and resorting to false and misleading arguments about regional rail transport, says Hašek
Jančura already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement which will mention the unfavorable moves of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he will pause the campaign after Christmas and intends to resume it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will target corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura started his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of the rail links for an order of around 150 billion crowns, without issuing a call for tenders.
According to Jančura, such a way of acting is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even brought Jančura threats from a deputy of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn&#39;t stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a deputy from ČSSD, I don&#39;t know who he is but I won&#39;t say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Vaccination against pneumococci will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococci will reverse old habits from January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voices are already rising, saying that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are coming to a head.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines the maximum prices for vaccines that health insurance will pay.
Specialists also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for August children.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated against pneumococci free of charge.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay for subsequent vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Already last year a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococci.
Yet the parents paid 1600 crowns or more for a dose.
The vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Specialists estimate that each year health insurers spend 300 to 450,000 crowns on doses of vaccine.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
Until now the state spent about 500,000 crowns a year for all the vaccination of children.
Reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the &quot;Janota package&quot;.
Pneumococci are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, there are up to 28 deaths of children under the age of 10 caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be compulsory?
There are notices about a possible obligation to vaccinate in the future.
From January, it must be paid by insurance and optional.
For example the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
His association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococci.
At an international conference in which our association took part, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It&#39;s not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we were able to impose at least this.
I think that&#39;s a direction that we have to follow now, said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are absolutely not considering it at the moment, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Optional vaccination has its downsides, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Society of Pediatricians, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its shortcomings.
If all the children were vaccinated, we could envisage a drop in vaccination renewals &quot;In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum, I understand the decision making vaccination optional&quot;, says Cabrnochová, however.
Experts predict that by next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated.
Vaccination against pneumococci also marks a break because it is the first vaccination of children which is financed by insurance and not by the State.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance companies should release funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves
This is, however, linked to the concerns of practicing paediatricians, which relate to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intent was to have the vaccines purchased by insurance, with physicians receiving them in the same way as other state-provided vaccine products.
Some MEPs feared, however, that this would allow insurance companies to &quot;deduct the sums from health insurance&quot;.
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to reimburse them.
According to estimates, individual pediatricians will have to invest almost 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
US artist&#39;s son involved in &#39;museum robbery&#39;
The son of acclaimed illustrator Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20m (£12m) from his father&#39;s museum.
In Pennsylvania, police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was pulled over while loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the entrance to the museum, in the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his character designs such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press (AP) news agency reported.
AP quoted a police official as saying that young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family dispute.
According to a police statement, said Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52, claims to have been authorized by his father to &quot;enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility&quot;, reported the agency.
Mr. Frazetta Sr. denies giving such permission, the agency said.
Labor defends the increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the tax hike and spending cuts announced in the pre-Budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, business and unions.
The Tories have claimed that Alistair Darling &quot;missed&quot; an opportunity to show he was serious about cutting the deficit by postponing decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor has also drawn ire by attacking low and middle-wage earners.
Among its main proposals is a 0.5% increase in Social Insurance and a 1% ceiling rate on public wages from 2011.
The wrath of social insurance
Unions protested that low wages are being penalized by a recession for which they are not responsible and warned that &quot;problems&quot; were ahead.
The cut in Social Security - which will provide around £3 billion a year - has angered the business world, saying it is a tax on jobs when the aim should be a revival of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than £20,000 a year, will affect around 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Insurance will increase by another 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will shrink even more than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
The corporate income tax increase for small corporations has been dropped
Tax rebates for electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, someone earning £30,000 will lose £90 per year and someone earning £40,000 will lose £190, while someone earning £10,000 per year will earn £110 more.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 entailed &quot;difficult decisions&quot; but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall on the top 5% of workers.
Stephen Timms, the Treasury Secretary, refuted a tax increase and pointed out that a cut in spending was a &quot;drop in the bucket&quot; compared to what was needed.
&quot;These figures are important. They will allow us to halve the deficit, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years,&quot; he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again at the end of the year.
However, Labour&#39;s forecasts for economic growth - which will influence how much it will have to borrow and how quickly the deficit will be closed - have been thrown into doubt after the Chancellor was forced to revise his early figures.
In his remarks, he said the economy was likely to shrink by 4.75% this year - much worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while borrowing would be GDP 3 billion higher than expected. preliminary estimate.
&#39;Missed opportunity&#39;
The Tories, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday warning against Labour&#39;s &#39;debt crisis&#39;, said plans to borrow £789billion over the next six years were unsustainable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, &quot;cynically&quot; evading tough choices until after elections - due to be held in June 2010.
&quot;They didn&#39;t come up with anything significant about what they were going to do,&quot; said Philip Hammond, chief treasury secretary in the shadow cabinet. &quot;They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it.&quot;
“Major announcements will be made after the election, whoever wins”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labor insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be shielded from further cuts, unlike Tory proposals which would see the deficit shrink faster and deeper.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money raised from the tax increases and spending cuts would be used to support next year&#39;s spending and not to cut the deficit, arguing that the plans were &quot;built on the wind&quot;.
Nick Robinson, BBC Political Editor, claimed the timing of announcements - such as the inflation hike for some disability benefits next April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor facing propaganda charges , the money being simply recovered the following year.
However, Labor insists that extra help is being given when people need it most and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
&quot;False budget&quot;
Although ministers did not release details of spending beyond 2011, economists said it was clear government spending cuts would only start to take effect in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies has claimed that the Chancellor&#39;s figures imply substantial cuts in many areas in the future, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence. .
&quot;The pain is really only postponed,&quot; said its Director, Robert Chote.
&quot;The most important announcements will be made after the election, whoever wins,&quot; added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to Deloitte Accountants.
&quot;This was a bogus pre-budget report. The markets are well aware of that.&quot;
FBI investigates &#39;American arrests in Pakistan&#39;
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American reporters suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the US Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether these were the same men who were reported missing from their home in the US state of Virginia last month.
The US State Department said it was also seeking information on these people.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are US citizens, of course we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are being held,&quot; spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
&quot;We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are missing,&quot; she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were arrested at a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
She said the house was already being watched by local police and no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters news agency reported, but said the United States should &quot;work more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people&quot;.
The five students were reported missing from their home by their families in northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian &quot;abuses&quot;
Over the past twenty years, human rights have been as little respected as ever, according to the report by the Amnesty International association.
the report presents &quot;repetitions of violations&quot; by the regime, before and after the campaign for the presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report claimed he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its lack of respect for human rights.
Authorities have claimed that such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been arrested and dozens killed in Iran, after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the biggest public protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says at the start of the protests Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some of the abuse allegations, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center .
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
&quot;False Confession&quot;
Amnesty International has reported on the case of a 26-year-old computer science student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed he was accused of &#39;Working with Facebook networks&#39; and protesting the election results.
&quot;They often punched me in the face,&quot; he was quoted as saying.
&quot;I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me.&quot;
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, losing election candidate Mehdi Karroubi claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
Iranian authorities denied the rape charges, but admitted that abuse had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he was locked in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks at a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that Iran&#39;s parliament and judiciary should set up a committee to investigate post-election unrest and the government&#39;s response, but said the bodies&#39; mandates and powers were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks in a bid to prevent further protests.
Ski slopes built in the city park
Over 100 tonnes of artificial snow was used to transform the Bristol venue into a competition track.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for cash prizes.
At the top of the track in Brandon Hill Park, a small springboard preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said the view from the top of the track was beautiful but it was quite intimidating.
It&#39;s a beautiful sight, with all the city lights twinkling below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talent,&quot; he added.
Prizes were awarded to the best aerobatics - or tricks performed on the track.
After Thursday night&#39;s party, the snow will be left to melt.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be drawn to this new book, admirers of the author&#39;s latest, &quot;Why the French don&#39;t like the headscarf&quot; (2006), an elegant and well-researched study of an issue that has divided and troubled the country for fifteen years ago and whose effects are still being felt today.
Mr. Bowen&#39;s latest book presents a much broader and more ambitious plot.
A good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He spent many months in the mosques, schools and institutes which now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls &quot;Muslim spaces&quot; for 5m-6m Muslims.
He knows very well how to listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them the most.
Should a Muslim get married in a mosque or at the town hall (or both)?
Should gay evolution and rights be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical issues, he argues, that are the daily grind, rather than the political dramas that preoccupy the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab Muslim.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the end.
The Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr. Bowen generally agree with their fellow advocates of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia who today make up a small part of Europe&#39;s Muslims.
M Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each side.
He wonders to what extent French politicians (and the intellectual elite that are so virulent guardians of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims have not been spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, he detects a &quot;narrowness of key values&quot;.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say &quot;yes, but not yet.&quot;
The darkest sight in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing are navigating new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In “On Thin Ice,” writer and illustrator Richard Ellis paints a natural history of the symbol of the far north, the polar bear.
Familiar with the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by hunting polar bears.
The encounter with Admiral Nelson, then a brave 14-year-old midshipman who only had to fight with the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
Young cubs, caught swimming alongside their recently killed mother, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show brought together 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally one millionth of the area needed for a free-ranging adult. the climate is rarely given: a polar bear living in Singapore turned green due to algae growing in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada where hunters in helicopters and Inuit Indians on motorbikes use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations are where the ice will last the longest.
In his new book, &#39;After the Ice&#39;, Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling summary of Arctic science and a gripping glimpse of what the future may hold. over there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphericists nor oceanographers can accurately relate the rate of change.
It&#39;s not for lack of trying.
At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, the pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen provided the first information on the melting of the ice cap.
Cold War submarines then mapped the landform changes beneath it.
Satellite surveys and probes placed on icebergs are a great help, but most of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the tributary system of the arctic ice, formed by the trickles of brackish water pressed while freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, all will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, expected between 2013 and 2050.
&quot;In a few months, it may be our turn&quot;
Marines among 6,000 who laid wreaths at graves in Arlington
First Class De&#39;Angello Robinson, 19, took a seven-hour bus journey to lay a simple wreath at the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to saluting the men and women who were once at their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If this happened to me, I would want someone to do the same for me, that&#39;s why I&#39;m just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths at veterans&#39; graves in various sections of Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, started the commemoration, and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
Now, continuing an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife, Karen, make the trip each year, stopping in different towns along the way, to hold memorials honoring service members and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters have also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths at graves in Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, at graves in Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and at the Memorial site for the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her late career military husband.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, the gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed.
It&#39;s a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It&#39;s like visiting a family grave.
Bundled up in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the sprawling hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers chose old graves, dating from World War I and World War II, as well as the Vietnam War, because these are not visited as often as new graves, organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, as children played and couples held hands, carrying the wreaths of fresh pine on the gray graves.
Each round wreath had a dark green color, with a small red bow tie on the top.
Nearby, silence hovered over Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
People were crying out loud, others were praying, and families and friends were supporting each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names carved into the stone while others leaned over to see the small black and white information cards, buried in the damp earth for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many tearful mothers at her son&#39;s grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio, and drove eight hours to pay her respects at the grave of Marine Sergeant Gunnery David Shane Spicer, who died in action in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free…my son paid for it, she said.
&quot;Long after I&#39;m gone, I want someone to remember him.&quot;
US national arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a US national who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, the US State Department said.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company works on projects for clients such as the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities as well as the US Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor can be arrested on the pretext of being &quot;dangerous&quot;.
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez made several requests to leave the country to receive awards, but permission was always denied.
The detention of a US national may increase tensions between the communist brotherhood government in Cuba and the Obama administration which is pursuing a &quot;soft&quot; approach to improve relations with the island.
News of the arrest was first reported by The New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government take concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the United States can return the favor.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although these are new and desired consumer goods in a country where the average salary for a civil servant is $15 a month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texting or for a 15-minute conversation that is a day&#39;s pay.
On the island, internet use is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors to the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to connect often must communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, press officer with the US Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn&#39;t provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention is a big mistake.
An activity that in any other open society would be permitted -- distributing free mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program at Human Rights Watch, which recently released a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called &quot;New Castro, same Cuba&quot;, referring to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country to replace Fidel, his ailing older brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned the same day.
He said any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States as the two countries begin to engage in better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization believed to be plotting to send five Northern Virginia men to Afghanistan to kill US troops, saying they hoped the case would uncover a major network of terrorist recruiters who scour the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators claimed they were hunting a hidden insurgent figure, known as Saifullah who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments endorsing the terrorist waves on the video site YouTube on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote region of Pakistan&#39;s tribal belt, home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who was briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of the CIA&#39;s plot to infiltrate the terror network. .
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains in the northeast that had become a haven for terrorism.
They were considered undercover agents.
That&#39;s why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities claimed that the men were determined and that they were still trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to obtain entry into the al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- underscores the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly, in determining whom to grant Her confidence.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the American secret services have made it a priority to infiltrate men into the al-Qaida network.
The organization&#39;s recruiters act as gatekeepers, denying entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may turn out to be spies.
Analysts say potential American recruits are being closely scrutinized by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert from the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups have also had to be increasingly careful in recent years about who they accept because the US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you&#39;re trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow their recruiting pattern that so many other people have already followed? Kohlmann said.
The model is one that is growing on the Internet.
Tens of Thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen Call for Climate &#39;Action&#39;
Tens of thousands of Protestants marched through the streets here on Saturday demanding greater climate action from negotiators working at the city&#39;s Bella Convention Center.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000 people, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
The event passed off relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists set off some explosives near a cluster of government buildings downtown.
On a day when little happened at the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city, unfurling signs in English saying &#39;There is no planet B and one in Spanish, stating &quot;Earth says it&#39;s had enough&quot;.
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including Danish top model and photographer, Helena Christensen, who said traveling to her mother&#39;s native Peru opened her eyes to the heartbreaking issues facing the country due to the impact of climate change that is already happening.&quot;
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join the great march -- to spread the word and call on leaders around the world to make decisions that are fair, ambitious and committed, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police stopped protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people for wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
Police stopped protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people for wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to remain anonymous due to his involvement in the climate talks, the activists, who were wearing masks and black clothes, set off several explosives near the main Copenhagen canal which is surrounded by a few ministries .
They were throwing them near buildings, he said, adding that these were rockets first, followed by &quot;some big explosions&quot;.
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around television screens to follow the march, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters failed to raise the conscience of key authorities such as Su Wei, China&#39;s climate representative.
When asked if he thought a protest would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, &quot;Actually, that&#39;s something I wasn&#39;t aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, stating &quot;Since the event is big, I can&#39;t hear what&#39;s going on outside.&quot;
He observed that walking could appear harmful or helpful depending on one&#39;s perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors in the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, &quot;you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or interfere with the freedom of others.&quot;
Test results reveal stubborn differences between races
Last week&#39;s federal math results report brought good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District still lags far behind the leading institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are making much greater progress in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest numbers from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between African-American and white outcomes, both locally and nationally.
The average results of Grade 4 (cm1) white children in WashingtonD.C. rose over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates rose only three points, from 209 to 212.
The achievement gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally steady, falling only one point, from 245 to 244.
The average blank result was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
The overview over a six-year period is not more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in the Grade 4 (cm1) classroom, when the District&#39;s first NAEP report was released, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference only narrowed to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District expressed concern that the rise celebrated by Educational Institutions Group Director Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) was propelled by white students. who were already good elements.
That would mean we&#39;ve elevated the aggregate by looking at the top-end items, which is problematic and embarrassing,&quot; said Jeff Smith, director of DC Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equality in District education.
I don&#39;t jump for a single or two points won, said Kwame R. Brown (Democratic relative), DC council member whose daughter is in Grade 4 at Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Rhee&#39;s management style, Brown said the message from the test results is that the city&#39;s middle schools desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect that.
But what is scary is that we do not devote enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of struggling students.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at schoolchildren in the end of elementary cycle and beginning of middle school classes who have not integrated the basics of reading more early in their school career and who are quite behind their peers.
Every day, the math curriculum for Kindergarten (Kindergarten) through Grade 6 (6th grade) emphasizes real-life games and experiences, as implemented in the District by former official Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the NAEP progress reported last week.
I just think we need to keep working to provide better interventions for these below-grade students, Rhee said.
Others believe the NAEP results beg the question of whether Rhee can continue to elevate overall system results while providing the money and resources for lower-performing schools to close the gap.
It&#39;s a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education trainer at UC Berkeley in California who studies city test results.
The conventional policy solution is to focus your resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
So this targeting can have political repercussions that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other Superintendents of Schools, she tries to make use of the middle class of whites and blacks.
We are focused on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they are from, can be assured that their children will be able to obtain an excellent public education.
Janey, now Newark Schools Superintendent, said in an interview this week that one of the key elements in closing the achievement gap was the length of traditional public school, today 180 days in the District of Washington, to compete with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with her teachers&#39; union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a &quot;starting point&quot; for get another raise in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise for the future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, climbs out and blinks for a moment at the sight of white columns, brick facades and lush green lawns.
Graciela&#39;s parents had only been able to finish high school, in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
So as she and other Grade 8 students in the group explored Gettysburg where tuition is $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of an impressed new student than an enthusiastic one.
Great That&#39;s where I&#39;m going to study! exclaimed Graciela who would like to study medicine, as the guide directed them to the entrance of the science building.
Yippee, really? she mused, when told of the low law professor-to-student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh the kids visited on their three-day journey of discovery, and by now they had fully taken on the message: The question isn&#39;t whether you&#39;re going to college:
The question is where.
Although this question is still widely asked for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school or became parents as teenagers, there are also hundreds of thousands who benefit from the university education which allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, &quot;one in five &#39;second-generation&#39; Hispanics go on to high school -- a notable achievement considering that so many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, entered the United States. United without having finished high school.
Their success is important, say the researchers, as they pave the way for future generations to play an important role in the country&#39;s workforce.
Researchers who study achievers say they have a natural affinity with school and an innate need to succeed.
There are also many whose parents set high goals for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentorship programs also play a huge role in helping Graciela and millions of kids like her make it to college -- especially if her efforts are consistent and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who lack the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention at any time will not help them. , said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who has studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit to Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million annually to local school systems to run college-readiness programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school. school (college) and continue until the end of the high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been taken by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering college, according to the US Department of Education.
Iraqi oil ministry secures deals with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its ailing infrastructure in two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Oil Ministry with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are poised to play a major role in the rehabilitation of Iraq&#39;s oil industry , invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
US companies walked away with a stake in just two of the 10 fields up for auction.
Seven US companies had paid to participate in the second auction which started on Friday.
The only one who placed a bid lost.
Two US companies won contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The weak representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies are paving the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, a site of information on the Internet.
It will be a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as US military troops withdraw have held back US oil companies, preventing them from entering with greater force into Iraq, which has the third largest crude oil reserves in the world, analysts say.
American companies were in some cases at a disadvantage because of their rivals, particularly the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labor costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks. because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only US companies to win contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum and provided it with technical advice, left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded over the weekend.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. bid more on contracts than other companies and walked away with large stakes in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and fulfill its commitments in Iraq.
Companies pre-selected to submit bids made bids which were then compared to the price per barrel the ministry agreed to pay to incentivize production above current levels for each field.
One of al-Qaeda&#39;s main organizers reportedly killed in Pakistan
A US missile hitting along the border with Afghanistan appears to have killed one of the organizers of al-Qaeda operations this week, US counterintelligence authorities said on Friday.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles launched into their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to US and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside Pakistan&#39;s lawless tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, a member of Pakistan&#39;s civilian intelligence service said, speaking on Miran Shah&#39;s phone.
Authority officials said the suspected local activists rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of the &quot;totally shredded bodies&quot;.
It was completely impossible for the local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two American anti-terrorist representatives gave unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of al-Qaeda&#39;s senior military organizers who directed the group&#39;s terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize conspiracies around the world, said one of the authorities who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of the airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given his central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic instructions of the leaders of al-Qaeda and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second US authority official said Somali had risen rapidly through al-Qaeda&#39;s ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to the general American public, but that doesn&#39;t lessen the threat he poses to us and our allies, the second official said.
If confirmed dead, Somali would be the second senior al-Qaeda figure or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a militant faction in the tribal belt, along with three other operators.
The rate of attacks carried out by CIA drones has decreased since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to figures put forward by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a nonprofit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have moved to decrease their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site claims.
UN special envoy to Kabul steps down
UN special envoy to Afghanistan Kai Eide said on Friday he would step down from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of widespread corruption in presidential elections backed by the UN.
Eide&#39;s departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase but expressed concern about the US timetable for a troop withdrawal which would begin in 18 months and which would force other NATO governments to withdraw their strengths.
We need to speed up the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a phone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials helping Afghanistan&#39;s political transition.
The military augmentation should be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning but would simply honor the commitment he made to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there had been a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
Representatives claim that Staffan di Mistura&#39;s name was cited; they are an Italian-Swiss citizen who recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously headed UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide&#39;s reputation in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in presidential elections and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the allegations but said the accusations by Galbraith -- who was fired -- &quot;damaged the mission because there was already a fair amount of skepticism about international election observation.&quot; .
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries than is assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in how their money is being spent.
Eide expressed frustration with the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying the UN&#39;s onerous hiring regulations hampered his opportunities to bring in new talent.
UN rules are such that I have only been able to recruit one person since May, he said.
It&#39;s catastrophic and it can&#39;t last.
Gates: Iran must face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that major world powers would soon impose &quot;significant additional sanctions&quot; on Iran over its failure to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to an audience of 300 US troops in northern Iraq during a week-long visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, played down the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier&#39;s question about the possibility of such an outcome.¨
One of the things that weighs on me the most is that if I&#39;ve learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it&#39;s the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a set of sanctions that would target Iran&#39;s military and political elite, but Gates has signaled that some of those sanctions could also affect Iranians on the street.
He said a &quot;set of incentives and punishments&quot; might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact be less safe with nuclear weapons&quot; because &quot;its people would suffer immensely&quot; from these sanctions.
In a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs on Friday, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face &#39;likely&#39; consequences if it does not bring back its nuclear program. in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran persists in saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experiment solely for peaceful purposes.
In the Geneva talks on October 1, it indicated that it would resume dialogue on reducing its nuclear program and agreed to give up a significant part of its stockpile of enriched uranium, in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration pushed for such an agreement as a way to build trust on both sides and buy time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have walked away from attempts at a deal - in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, Iran&#39;s stiffening of some of the proposals from the international community that they had in fact agreed to in early October caused the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to come together on what they hadn&#39;t considered, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before he turns to other options, including pursuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has times called &quot;increased penalties&quot;.
In a statement on Thursday in New York, Iran&#39;s mission to the United Nations denounced what it called &quot;baseless allegations&quot; by some members of the Security Council about Iran&#39;s nuclear activities and said that she agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, &quot;in order to obtain a satisfactory long-term solution&quot;.
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region to meet with troop leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil. .
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly over borders, property rights and revenue sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict to avoid any delays to US plans to reduce US troop numbers from 115,000 to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm Kurdish anxiety about the pending withdrawal. US authorities quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, Chairman of the Kurdistan Regional Government: &quot;We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq&quot;.
We won&#39;t let you down.&quot;
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters lecturing them, &quot;Mother Earth is too tired to take in more children&quot; and &quot;An extra baby is an extra grave.&quot;
They learned the lesson so well that Shanghai government authorities, alarmed by their city&#39;s low birth rate and aging population, drastically changed direction this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We don&#39;t have a second left, said Wang, 31, director of human resources and who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of China&#39;s one-child policy, creating two generations of notoriously good-cheeked and spoiled only children, dubbed the &quot;little emperors&quot;, a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple from six when the policy was implemented.
The population distribution, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to explode, from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. above the global average by about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in wealthy coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over made up nearly 22 percent of Shanghai&#39;s registered resident population, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said fertile couples should have babies in order &quot;to help reduce the proportion of the aging population and to prevent a shortage of manpower in the future&quot;.
Shanghai is about to become &quot;as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden&quot;, she said.
Gradual attenuation
Written into the country&#39;s constitution in 1978, China&#39;s one-child policy is arguably the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government to date.
Couples who violate this policy risk huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and face discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese authorities have assigned the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have exposed abuses in the execution of this policy.
In rural areas, some authorities have forced women pregnant with a second child to have abortions.
In addition, many couples resorted to sex-selective abortions leading to an abnormally high boy-to-girl ratio.
In recent years, population authorities have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which the husband and wife are already only children -- and in 2007, they softened a lot of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research, Peking University, said central government authorities have recently been discussing even more sweeping changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters urging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet with couples at their homes and slip flyers under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial counseling for those wishing to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response has been disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records from couples wanting a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban district reported that there is no was no change.
The commune of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five requests per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only around 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai&#39;s Caolu township, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don&#39;t want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed to.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly view the one-child policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple&#39;s first child.
It&#39;s true, we are being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It&#39;s the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, said she only wanted an only child because she was one herself. &quot;We were the center of the family and used to everyone looking after us.&quot;
We&#39;re not used to taking care of anyone else and we really don&#39;t want to take care of other people.&quot;
Chen Zijian, 42 and owner of a translation company puts it more bluntly.
For working-pair, middle-class couples who drive down the birth rate, he says, you have to be selfish to do well.
People in their 20s or 30s grew up watching their parents struggle in the early days of capitalist China and don&#39;t want to have that lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even a single child demands a lot of parents&#39; time, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues -- &quot;You need to modify your apartment&quot; -- and planning -- &quot;When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write their CV to get a place in the best kindergarten.&quot;
Most of his friends are up for this experience once, Chen says, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to enjoy a higher standard of living, he says.
We don&#39;t want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations group has draft plans for reducing emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- so far characterized by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- returned to the limelight on Friday, due to the release of a document highlighting cuts greenhouse gas emissions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden, in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, underlined the remaining obstacles, as much as it clarified the path to be taken.
But it was seen as a major step forward in the time-strapped negotiations, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Written by a special UN working group, the text does not say how much the rich countries would give to the poor to support global warming, in the short and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key questions, including how developed economies and new emerging economies might decrease their carbon output and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be ready to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said Sierra Club Washington Representative John Coequyt.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who authored six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiations text to focus on what UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer described as &quot; the complete picture&quot;.
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, by 25 to 45 percent below 1990 levels, while major developing countries, during the same period, would reduce theirs by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also relaunched negotiations on Friday, pledging to provide $3.6 billion a year for the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to cope with floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, Representative of the United States in the climate negotiations rejected any discussion obliging the reduction of greenhouse gases by the industrialized countries, in comparison with the voluntary efforts carried out by the main emerging economies, if these were not funded by developed countries.
This change signals that the Obama administration is getting tougher on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not insist enough on ensuring that the reductions could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei said the US lead negotiator either lacked &quot;common sense&quot; or was &quot;extremely irresponsible&quot; for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not financially help China to fight against global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of major world powers at stake, fault lines have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about rescuing individual economies than rescuing the planet, with China and the United States bickering over their respective obligations as poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential nations ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was no surprise that major powers were fighting over who should bear the costs of greenhouse gas reductions, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to hold major emitters accountable for their actions.
It&#39;s really a game in which a new economic hegemony is being developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of those countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated they will continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants say the negotiations will lead to at least a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the European Commission&#39;s climate unit, said action by small island states has &quot;put political pressure on the whole political process&quot;, in part because they are now unified and that they call on emerging economies such as China and India to act.
Debates became an urgent matter, as delegates focused on resolving most outstanding issues before government leaders reached agreement.
High-level officials such as India&#39;s Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China&#39;s Vice Minister descended from their planes and rushed to the Bella Center building to attend closed-door meetings and information conferences, in order to be able to make complaints which will be studied during the following week.
The true picture of the rally -- at which 13,000 people walk in and out of the Palais des Congrès each day -- of guitar-playing activists put on late-night performances mocking countries they say are betraying themselves and proposals are being drafted and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and as late as Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are stepping into the big leagues,” said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
In Britain, the first 225 km / h train will redefine the Monday syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Great Britain.
The country&#39;s first high-speed commuter train will reach 225km/h as it zips from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 93km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister for Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin commuter train outside London.
He hopes the new service will allow Britain to join an international network of fast and reliable trains and link major conurbations in the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
Backwaters will become thriving suburban towns, business travel times will be much shorter, and the shift from air and car to train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic congestion.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental hazards are likely to hold back Britain&#39;s high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will deliver its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five meters of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment may be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also expected to present three options for a larger, northbound high-speed network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
Preferred options are put forward in a Y-configuration for which a high-speed line will run to the West Midlands.
The line will split into two at or near Birmingham, with one branch running west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another running north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
“It looks like it will be the best performance option,” said a rail professional.
When this is complete, travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which won&#39;t open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one-hour journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making Britain&#39;s network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains of 400m in length and capable of transporting 1,100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal capable of handling 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given the space constraints, it is planned that an existing station will be extended to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say only St Pancras International or Euston offer this facility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the scheme should go ahead, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean a final decision will not be made until a general election.
Even if he launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will initially be forced to run off high-speed lines on existing tracks north of Birmingham, keeping journey times between London and Scotland in excess of three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure a transition from planes to trains, constituting a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay £75,000 loan for Tory Orangery
Alan Duncan, leading Tory member of parliament, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to repay the cost of an orangery he built at his home in his constituency.
The party leader who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of parliament were &quot;kept up&quot;, has increased his loan by £75,000 to build an oak extension to his second home in Rutland.
He had been authorized to charge the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds a month, to the taxpayer.
Commons authorities received the complaints at the time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carries out a check on members&#39; expenses. Last night Mr Duncan said the complaints could not be &#39;clearer or simpler&#39;.
Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
The neighboring houses were sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor has a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the emoluments office says Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbors describe it as a &quot;veranda for fun&quot;.
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increased borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons Privileges and Standards Committee into his prior borrowing arrangements.
The Committee last month cleared him of all charges of breaking the rules, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004 Mr Duncan changed the legal security of borrowing £271,406 from his London property to his constituency house which he bought in 1991, the year before he became a Member of Parliament.
Documents released this week show Mr Duncan was claiming around £1,400 a month in loan interest until March last year.
In April, his claims increased by more than £1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr Duncan&#39;s RBS loan was not changed at this time, suggesting that any increases were intended to fund the £75,000 loan.
The RBS variable standard interest rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, unchanged since then.
The latest publication from Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan was still asking for £1,250 in May.
Mr Duncan lost his job as Shadow Cabinet Leader in September, after an undercover reporter allegedly filmed him saying members of parliament had to survive &#39;on budget&#39; following the spending scandal.
&quot;In fact, it&#39;s now national, you have to live &#39;on budget&#39; and you&#39;re treated like &#39;s…e&#39;
He said: &quot;I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small portion, based on what was correct.
and I could have asked for a hell of a lot more, but I didn&#39;t.&quot;
The member of parliament, a millionaire from his former job as an oil trader, began having to explain his expenses in May after it emerged he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before to agree with the fees office that this &quot;could be considered excessive&quot;.
An activist has dug a £-shaped hole in Mr Duncan&#39;s lawn in protest after it was revealed he had demanded £4,000 over three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Mr Duncan said: &#39;It was for capital improvements, approved by both the fee office and then Legg.&#39;
He added: &quot;There&#39;s no problem with evasion or making or using the rules or anything.
It was all clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It couldn&#39;t be any cleaner or simpler.&quot;
Faithful, all come and see the Brighton Advent Calendar
Brighton Beach Huts have found a new means of promotion for the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabins for each day of December, using Christmas carols as their theme.
The event began on December 1, when visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. each day, with pies and mulled wine served free of charge.
Christmas carols chosen so far include &quot;I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas&quot;, for which the cabin features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest in the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: &quot;We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
“As a Church, why are we waiting for people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should get closer to people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
“The idea for the beach cabin Advent calendar came right after a conversation with a few friends over dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experience and represent that through spirituality.&quot;
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world for the climate
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where the police made several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Conference, responsible for leading by Friday to a agreement which may enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization on the climate around the world, illustrated by these demonstrations, contributed to making &quot;the political price&quot; of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the procession, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed entirely in black, smashed windows with cobblestones and hammers, noted an AFP journalist.
Riot police immediately intervened bluntly.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, essentially, according to them, members of &quot;the Blacks Blocs&quot;, these ultra-violent small groups which had notably distinguished themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of activists were arrested &quot;without distinction&quot;, stressing that around a hundred of them &quot;were still being held in the street on Saturday evening &quot;handcuffed and kept in a seated position despite the extreme cold&quot;.
Leaving Parliament, the procession, rather good-natured, took the direction of the Bella Center, site of the negotiations.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to enter.
A stage had been set up to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrators had come by bus and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most of them in sky blue raincoats, had formed a first rally in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form &quot;blue tides&quot; for &quot;climate justice&quot;.
Today, we take to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can&#39;t keep saying to ourselves: we have time, said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that are drying up in Africa, waterways where you can walk like you never have before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement has approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, explained that he had come to Copenhagen to &quot;link climate justice and social justice&quot;: &quot;today, there is no break between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world&quot;.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to global warming, had kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, organizers said, took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, marched in red, wearing bandanas touting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, rallies of a few hundred demonstrators were also held to demand energetic action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the &quot;350&quot; network brought together a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces a &quot;farce&quot;
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a &quot;farce&quot;.
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first ballot after the Russo-Georgian war of August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
Polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
Turnout was 58% hours before the close, according to officials from the Abkhaz Election Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced overnight from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates in the running, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which has condemned the holding of the ballot.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakashvili, &quot;regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia&quot;, declared his spokesperson, Manana Manjgaladzé.
Besides Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which caused several thousand deaths, Abkhazia is seeking to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, told AFP, who claimed to have voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among voters who went to the polling station at a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a pretty white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr. Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are installed throughout this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, gave a warm welcome to Russian officials who had come to monitor the conduct of the ballot.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, referring to Moscow&#39;s support, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazia&#39;s independence.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the ballot by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, such as the one ceding to Russia the control over the Abkhaz Railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: protests around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Climate Conference in Copenhagen, where the police, on the alert, arrested nearly 700 people on the sidelines of an imposing expression.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of a agreement which will enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Leaving Parliament, the procession, generally good-natured, took the direction of the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage had been set up to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the departure of the procession, a group of a few hundred demonstrators, dressed entirely in black, armed with bricks and hammers, broke windows, noted an AFP journalist.
Riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened bluntly, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of &quot;Black Blocks&quot;, these ultra-violent groups which had notably distinguished themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a cobblestone and four cars set on fire near a squat during incidents which led to the arrest of around twenty people, according to the police.
We are keeping an eye on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned as police helicopters circled overhead.
The majority of the demonstrators, who came by bus and train from the big cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most of them in sky blue raincoats, had formed a first rally in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form &quot;blue tides&quot; for &quot;climate justice&quot;.

The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to global warming, had kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, organizers said, took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and wearing bandanas touting solar energy in front of the town hall of the Philippine capital.

History-geo emerges strengthened from the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to be published in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography came out &quot;reinforced&quot; from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory education in science terminal.
From now on, the pupils of first will all have four hours per week and the same program for a shared common culture, affirms Mr. Chatel.
For the Minister, &quot;we must get out of hypocrisy&quot; because, according to him, &quot;the S sector is no longer a scientific sector&quot; but &quot;basically, it concentrates the best students&quot;.
The ES and L streams cannot remain sub-streams of the S, he continues, emphasizing again: &quot;I have not heard many historians and intellectuals indignant at the absence of history-geography in the final year in technological high schools&quot;.
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L&#39;Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French people (69%) disapproved of the government&#39;s plan to abolish compulsory teaching of history and geography in terminale S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this deletion, as well as the left and some right-wing elected officials.
The minister, on the other hand, added that there was &quot;no question&quot; of removing the philosophy of the terminale S program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which according to them sacrifices the educational training of future teachers.
In master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year which will relate to their discipline, then at the end of the year an admission test which will relate to their ability to teach, explained the minister.
They will also follow internships in situation during the year of M2 then will be a first year in front of the students as trainee teachers.
If you add up all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the Minister indicates that he will propose &quot;the individual right to training, something that does not exist in National Education&quot;.
It also reaffirms the project to abolish the school map &quot;by 2012&quot;.
At Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince on the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge taken up on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure from the rue d&#39;Ulm.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize winner, inaugurated the first of the &quot;Ernest&quot; conferences, a day consisting of a series of interventions by experts, lasting fifteen minutes each, filmed and open to the public, noted a journalist from the AFP.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more, explained on the sidelines of the conference Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of this day which takes its name from that given by the students. fish from the school pond.
We choose about twenty speakers from among the experts in their discipline and we select them for their charismatic side, he specified.
About global warming, &quot;we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes,&quot; Jean Jouzel told AFP, who spoke without notes, but using graphics. , in front of about fifty people.
This is part of our role as scientists, he stressed, hoping that listeners will remember that &quot;the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific file&quot;.
The videos taken from these conferences will be posted on the school&#39;s website from December 15th.
The next &quot;Ernest&quot; day is scheduled for February, followed by others on a bimonthly basis.
Delayed payments: anger of prison guards, planned actions
The unions of prison guards called on Friday for &quot;general mobilization&quot; to demand the payment by the end of the year holidays of bonuses and overtime, the payment of which has been postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2nd union of guards) asked the staff who will not be in service to demonstrate Tuesday morning in front of the penitentiary establishments and to &quot;block&quot; them, to &quot;denounce the theft of their dues&quot;.
The CGT-Penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to &quot;meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization&quot;, judging &quot;shameful and unacceptable&quot; the non-payment in December of &quot;overtime, night bonuses , Sundays and public holidays&quot; worked in October.
And the first union of guards, the Autonomous Federal Penitentiary Union (Ufap / Unsa), &quot;calls for general mobilization (...) to bring up discontent and anger&quot;.
The Directorate of Penitentiary Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and have not all been budgeted, but ensure that the remainder will be paid in January.
The Chancellery clarified at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing them that this payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by staff for the operation and modernization of our penitentiary system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the management of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures aimed at ensuring that this situation, born of a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours, does not happen again in the future, adds Mrs Alliot-Marie.
December&#39;s pay will therefore be meager, except for management personnel benefiting from the famous bonuses for functions and objectives, lamented Ufap / Unsa, for whom &quot;budgetary constraints have a good back&quot;.
It&#39;s a pure scandal, the interregional union FO of Marseille was indignant, announcing its decision to boycott until further notice &quot;all meetings and summonses&quot;.
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and public holidays if those of October are not regularized in December, the same goes for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and our missions without increasing our workforce, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the funds of the personnel, estimates the CGT-penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less badly off than others.
But in any case the account is not there, noted the secretary general of Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he gives &#39;nicer stuff&#39; than what he receives
US President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas with his family at the White House, told television &quot;high priestess&quot; Oprah Winfrey that he has a simple rule when it comes to gifts: &quot;I give nicer stuff than the ones I get&quot;.
In a special to air Sunday night on ABC, the president and his wife Michelle offer a glimpse of how they plan to celebrate the holiday season at their new, prestigious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged friend of the family will be there.
Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, adding that the dog would &quot;of course&quot; have a present, according to preview clips of the show.
And Michelle Obama took issue with her husband&#39;s claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: &quot;Certainly not, I got you some cool gifts last year,&quot; she said. teased the president.
Absolutely, was he forced to concede before retorting with humor by pointing to the pearl necklace of the First Lady: &quot;Who gave you this?&quot;.
During this one-hour, laid-back show with the famous host who was a strong supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as &#39;children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bicycle, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father, whom he rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my father who came to see us for Christmas and where he gave me a basketball, said the president.
It wasn&#39;t until much later in my life that I realized he was the one who gave me that ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her dollhouse.
I really didn&#39;t know how to organize a house so I lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arranging it around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reoperated, RTL claims he is in an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was operated on again in Los Angeles due to major &quot;lesions&quot; after an operation in France, but the situation is &quot;under control&quot; according to his entourage, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was operated on again overnight from Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors found &quot;lesions resulting from the operation&quot; of the herniated disc suffered in Paris on November 26, indicated in Paris its press service, specifying that these lesions had &quot;required a repairing operation&quot;.
The singer&#39;s press service, however, wanted to be reassuring, saying that the situation was &quot;under control&quot;, while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be communicated no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the singer&#39;s last tour, Johnny Hallyday would however have been plunged into an artificial coma to avoid &quot;pains and complications&quot;.
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient&#39;s condition when he has opened one eye, adds RTL.
Questioned by AFP, the press service neither confirmed nor commented on the information.
RTL also claims that &quot;according to certain sources&quot; no drain was laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for this herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, was performed by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic world.
He was not available on Thursday evening to comment on RTL&#39;s information.
Following the operation he performed on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, for an infection following the operation.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, close to Johnny Hallyday, estimated Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through &quot;a bad patch&quot;, but assured that he was &quot;no worries&quot; for the rocker, who is &quot;a fighter&quot;.
He had called me just before leaving for Los Angeles, and I told him that it was bullshit because flying twelve hours after such an operation is not playable, said Eddy Mitchell.
Wednesday evening, the singer&#39;s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to be reassuring, saying that Johnny Hallyday &quot;reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics&quot; and that the infection was &quot;contained&quot;.
Mr. Camus also said he spoke with Laeticia, the singer&#39;s wife, and did not notice any particular concern.
But the singer&#39;s health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone&#39;s surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on for &quot;small colon cancer&quot;, then for a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long &quot;Tour 66&quot;, presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, each health problem has been extensively commented on. Fans and journalists noticed the singer&#39;s difficulties in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009 / small basin: the first of Bousquet on his favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist at the 2009 Worlds in the long pool, won an international title on Thursday over a distance he particularly likes, the 50m freestyle, during the Euro-2009 in the short pool in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where wetsuits are allowed for the last time saw only three world records broken while we waited for a surge.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in the 200m medley and the other two by Russia in the men&#39;s 4x50m medley relay.
A regret for Bousquet, who was eyeing the world record for the 50m freestyle, of which he holds the mark in the long pool (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the 50m freestyle, it was the 28-year-old Frenchman who won in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at an international level.
Bousquet edged Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world mark (20.30) as he had envisioned.
You can always dream of better and in this case, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I was going to try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all of the swimmers were dressed in polyurethane suits, which will be banned from January 1.
At the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of combinations did not help this time the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the long course this summer in Rome, world records at stake.
The young swimmer failed to lower the mark he holds in the 400m freestyle (3:32.77) but nevertheless imposed himself by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn&#39;t give it my all in this race.
I knew I couldn&#39;t break a world record this time but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola sold for 1.5 million USD
A Roman sarcophagus panel that belonged in particular to the French writer Emile Zola was sold for 1.5 million dollars on Thursday, well above its estimate, announced the art dealer Sotheby&#39;s.
This front panel, two meters long and 63 cm high, dating from the 3rd century AD, was estimated between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble &quot;representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and bacchantes, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world&quot;, explained to AFP Tuesday Florent Heintz, vice-president Roman and Egyptian antiquity auctions at Sotheby&#39;s.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have bid the most so far, Sotheby&#39;s spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola goes back a few days.
The panel remained for almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively in the home of the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of her bathtub in her Parisian mansion, and in the home of Paul Reynaud. , Minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council before the accession to power of Marshal Pétain.
Remained a gray area of fifty years.
Searching the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an &quot;Emile Zola estate&quot; opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; and the fresco. of &quot;Rougon-Macquart&quot;.
Zelaya&#39;s failed attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico
Mexico considered on Thursday that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the deposed president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was refused a safe conduct by the putschist government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation overnight with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities of carrying out this transfer are not met, declared the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
Arriving in El Salvador on Wednesday to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government plane left for its place of origin, according to a source from the General Directorate of Migration.
The coup government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to &quot;resign&quot; and request political asylum abroad to grant him safe conduct.
But the deposed president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as a guest incumbent head of state.
The putschist government &quot;experienced a new failure in wanting me to resign from my office (...), they wanted me to resign&quot;, said Thursday Mr. Zelaya on Globo radio, on which he has often spoken since September. beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added playing a few chords the deposed president, a refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy has presented us with a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum request, the coup government&#39;s interior minister, Oscar Raul Matute, said on Wednesday. , on Honduran radio HRN.
I am not asking for asylum in any country, replied Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to be done as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors of Mr. Zelaya&#39;s departure had mobilized supporters of the ousted president on Wednesday, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military reinforced their siege.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government&#39;s position.
This demonstrates the marginal character of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had become close to Venezuelan socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on June 28, the day he had organized a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
Exiled in Costa Rica, he returned by surprise on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested to answer for the offense of &quot;high treason&quot; which the justice accuses him of, according to the putschist government.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti succeeded in organizing a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected in the controversial ballot recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted overwhelmingly against Mr. Zelaya&#39;s return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended higher on Thursday, with US trade balance figures showing the recovery in activity from both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The broader Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500 index gained 0.58% (6.40 points) at 1,102.35 points.
We have good news from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, she tempered, believing that the market was focusing on &quot;the glass half full&quot;.
For Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors have mainly focused on the figures for the US trade balance, &quot;which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter&quot;.
The trade deficit of the United States fell in October by 7.6% compared to September, to 32.9 billion dollars.
Conversely, analysts expected a widening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, particularly for goods exports, which reflects the growth in the economies of the United States&#39; major trading partners, commented Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy. com.
On the other hand, new jobless claims in the United States rose against all expectations last week, reaching 474,000 claims.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers &quot;has fallen to its lowest in a year,&quot; said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market fell.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday evening and that of the 30-year note at 4.492% against 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of government supporters boo the &quot;Ladies in White&quot;
A few hundred supporters of Cuban power shouted at the wives of political detainees gathered in Havana on Thursday for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were arrested.
Some forty &quot;Ladies in White&quot;, wives or relatives of political prisoners, were jeered at in the street by supporters of Raul Castro&#39;s government as they marched towards the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, a observed an AFP journalist.
Down with the Yankees!, &quot;mercenaries!&quot;, &quot;the street belongs to the revolutionaries!&quot;, &quot;Long live Fidel and Raul!&quot; chanted, fists raised, the partisans of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes agents who had come to &quot;ensure their protection&quot;.
The day before, a similar demonstration had taken place against the &quot;Ladies in White&quot; in Havana, without there being any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for International Human Rights Day were arrested by plainclothes police, noted an AFP journalist. .
The police forced the dissidents into civilian vehicles who were jeered at by government supporters, according to this journalist.
Arrests of dissidents in similar circumstances usually only last a few hours.
Recipients of the European Parliament&#39;s 2005 Sakharov Prize, the &quot;Ladies in White&quot; had organized an unauthorized march to &quot;demand the release of all political prisoners&quot;, numbering 200 according to the dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan , whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is one of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents as &quot;mercenaries&quot; or &quot;agents&quot; in the pay of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely, Cuban television reported on Thursday&#39;s demonstration by pro-government activists against &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot;.
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of flouting rights and freedoms, particularly of expression.
A maniac kills an octogenarian with a knife and injures 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
A maniac armed with two knives killed an octogenarian and injured five other people in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at a rush hour, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the attacker, aged 28, would have struck with two knives and for undetermined reasons, an octogenarian, in or in front of a pharmacy at 85 boulevard Jean-Jaurès, we learned from police sources and from witnesses.
Seriously injured, the old man, born in 1929 according to an official of the Alliance police union, died in hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of this same pharmacy, he then attacked a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, in his thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenarian succumbed.
The life of the other injured man is in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then became unwell and would have been hospitalized &quot;in a state of shock&quot;, according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled into the street, still boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He allegedly injured two passers-by, apparently at random: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old, the latter seriously.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher&#39;s knives which he carried in a cross behind his back, explained on the spot an official of the Alliance union in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to testimonies collected by AFP, tried to control the madman.
I saw a guy in his thirties with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept it.
They didn&#39;t make it because the guy was big, said Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at No. 61, two municipal police officers, including their manager, tried to arrest the armed man and were punched, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passers-by came to tell me that there was an injured person outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I saw a very serious wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later a second person in his thirties arrived, with stab wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre public prosecutor&#39;s office referred the investigation to the Hauts-de-Seine departmental judicial police service (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized Thursday evening.
He had not yet been heard in custody.
A police source did not exclude that he was interned in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to subdue him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was &quot;in a state of over-excitement&quot; like &quot;all maniacs of this species whose forces increase tenfold under the effect of action&quot;.
USA: Polanski&#39;s lawyer again calls for the charges to be dropped
The lawyer for Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again demanded Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States), the abandonment of the proceedings against his client, currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a sexual assault case. over 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of the &quot;Pianist&quot;, denounced before three judges of the Court of Appeals for the second district of California of serious procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
I call for the charges to be dropped here and now, said Mr Hummel, before adding that the behavior of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, &quot;sent chills to the spine&quot;.
According to him, Judge Rittenband – since deceased – would have discussed, before rendering his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison – which constitutes a serious fault of procedure.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary &quot;Roman Polanski: wanted and desired&quot; (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September to have &quot;lied&quot; to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refuses to drop the charges, Mr. Hummel has called for a trial to be held, which would allow him to present the evidence for his case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the arguments already developed at first instance, namely that no dropping of the charges could be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, before his sentence was pronounced, for &quot;illegal sexual relations&quot; with a 13-year-old minor.
He has never set foot in the United States since.
Los Angeles County Assistant District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski &quot;must be there to show up for the hearing.&quot;
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that it is possible to escape? Asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker &quot;asks a favor from the court, while contemptuous of its authority&quot;.
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to render their decision -- also stressed that &quot;there were other alternatives to fleeing&quot;.
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to request the abandonment of the proceedings against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer for Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded, once again, the end of the proceedings.
Recalling that her client can no longer bear being harassed with each twist of the Polanski case, she added: &quot;No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, pending possible extradition.
Wall Street ends directionless, held back by rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a market torn between better than expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500 index rose 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, noted Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains within tight margins, the trading volume has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the release of better-than-expected economic indicators, which &quot;helped improve market sentiment about the strength of the economic recovery&quot;, summarized Charles Schwab analysts.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and much more than expected.
US consumer confidence also recovered significantly in December, to 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
The indices were however hampered by a further rise in the dollar, at its highest in two months against the euro, which &quot;pushes down sectors sensitive to the economic situation&quot;, explained Owen Fitzpatrick, of Deutsche Bank. .
Technology stocks have thus lost ground.
The bond market fell.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday evening and that of the 30-year note at 4.497% against 4.492% the day before.
The election of Miss World once again in South Africa
After a month of journey through South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World are preparing to cross the final stretch on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were elected Miss sportswoman or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was amazing.
I have seen so many things and had so many experiences! exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 5:00 p.m. (3:00 p.m. GMT).
I couldn&#39;t dream of a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience has been fascinating.
I am happy to have experienced it twice, underlines Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of &quot;breathtaking landscapes in this country&quot;.
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Misses are now concentrating on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom have become Bollywood stars.
It&#39;s every woman&#39;s dream to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it&#39;s not just about looks.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, launches Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional costume and of course in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by Chinese TV presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World Committee official Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with a warmth and a pride that is difficult to match, assures Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
Like last year, the candidates went on a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met South African President Jacob Zuma who shook their hands.
Not common for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their best memory will undoubtedly remain the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the June 2010 Football World Cup, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I&#39;ve dated people I never thought I&#39;d be able to approach.
I will definitely come back for the 2010 World Cup, enthuses Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News from Johnny Hallyday &quot;is very positive&quot;, says his son David
The news from Johnny Hallyday &quot;is very positive&quot;, assured his son David on Friday upon his arrival at Los Angeles airport where he was to go to the bedside of his father who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, it is going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he left the plane which brought him from Paris shortly after 1:00 p.m. local time (9:00 p.m. GMT).
The singer&#39;s son, looking relaxed, assured that he was going to go &quot;very quickly&quot; to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation. a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was &quot;placed in an artificial coma last night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment&quot;, indicated the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be operated on again overnight from Wednesday to Thursday due to significant lesions resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles where their daughter Jade is educated, to attend a school performance, noted an AFP photographer.
The head of orthopedic and traumatological surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would go to Los Angeles on Monday to see the singer.
The producer violently implicated Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Mr. Camus said.
I have heard of a possible legal proceeding to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus estimated that Johnny Hallyday had &quot;left much too quickly for Los Angeles, with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon&quot;.
I had this in person doctor online who assured me there was no problem for this trip and it blew me away considering I had two herniated discs myself, a- he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer had apparently &quot;left without a drain, with nothing&quot;, after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artistic world.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he practiced at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma following a cerebral hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulphurous reputation, convicted several times by the courts, in medical liability cases, as well as for tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, the lawyer for the Order of Doctors, accused him of being &quot;an unscrupulous man&quot; prosecuted &quot;regularly&quot; before the Council of the Order, and who is &quot;far from being recommendable&quot;.
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention had &quot;perfectly gone well&quot; and that the post-operative examinations were &quot;normal&quot;.
The operation &quot;was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the placement of a drain&quot;, he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, editor&#39;s note) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF association raises its tone and summons the New Center to no longer use its acronym
The UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou&#39;s MoDem, reacted on Friday to the takeover attempt by the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former Giscardien party, by putting him on notice not to use it on any medium, under penalty of legal proceedings.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF acronym, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after reaching out to the left.
The Minister of Defense, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of deputy Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP passed to NC) who claims ownership of the UDF trademark for having been the first to file it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property .
But Friday evening, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to let themselves be dispossessed, came out of its silence to issue a formal notice to the minister and the deputy, summoning them not to use the acronym and transfer ownership of the brand to them, under penalty of legal action.
You have multiplied, in recent days, the declarations indicating that you were going to propose to your political movement to + resume + the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also saw fit to follow on your militant material and on the cover page of your site, the name of this movement, the + New center +, the slogan + the UDF of today +, also note the signatories of the mail.
As you know, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the office of the UDF which gives formal notice to the NC to withdraw &quot;immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any support as well as (his) website&quot;.
He also asks Hervé de Charette &quot;to pass on ownership of (the) brand to its legitimate heirs&quot;.
If you did not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, warn the signatories.
In their letter, they specify that the UDF &quot;has been a political movement in its own right since 1978&quot; and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had &quot;chosen&quot; to leave it in 2007 &quot;to create a competing movement, like d others had done it in 2002, to create the UMP&quot;.
The New Center therefore has, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 its membership of the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office responsible for defending &quot;the material and moral interests&quot; of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d&#39;Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, continues the office, &quot;when he filed the trademark&quot;, he was &quot;no longer a member of the UDF for three years&quot;, but of the UMP.
He scandalously and fraudulently takes advantage of the lack of filing of the UDF acronym to do so on his behalf.
This indelicacy is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironizing about the strategy of the NC: &quot;It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for yourself -even than trying to emerge from anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled&quot;.
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine, if, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenarian for the despoiling part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, an offense punishable by a maximum sentence of three years&#39; imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
The move means there will indeed be a trial in this saga-worthy case of one of France&#39;s wealthiest families, in which mother and daughter tear each other apart while holding the reins of the cosmetics empire. &#39;Oreal.
But the 15th correctional chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87, should be carried out collectively by three doctors.
The heiress and main shareholder of L&#39;Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre prosecution during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will have to submit a report before March 10, 2010, saying in particular whether Liliane Bettencourt could have been in a state of weakness and at what periods.
I think she will submit to it.
I will talk to him about it, said Ms. Bettencourt&#39;s lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers&#39; lawyer, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court&#39;s decision.
This is excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady who must be protected, he said.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographer and jack-of-all-trades artist, whom she accuses of having taken advantage for years of the weakness of his mother to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
While the court had to examine the admissibility of the action brought by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers&#39; pleadings sometimes turned into a big family unpacking on Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt&#39;s lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was wary of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: &quot;could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I have never been able to speak to her since her marriage&quot;.
For its part, the Nanterre public prosecutor&#39;s office again considered that the complainant was inadmissible to act, especially since a guardianship judge has refused in recent days to grant her request to open proceedings for legal protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt &quot;has full capacity to take legal action, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place,&quot; said the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would rule once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Managerial revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain...
For more than ten years, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees has been reminiscent of the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of getting employees to adhere to &quot;values&quot; determined from above, as was the case in the past, of imposing on consumers products designed by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies for conquering markets right side up... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from the factors of customer preferences comes back regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the visible part of a much more general phenomenon which affects executives in particular.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the company&#39;s intellectual functions, in particular R&amp;D and, even more, economic intelligence.
Indeed, EI “requires all stakeholders (…) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision”; it requires on the part of the employees a commitment that the recipes of authoritarian management completely thwart.
This is why we are calling for a managerial revolution that would consist of putting employees at the center of the company&#39;s concerns in the same way as the customer.
The very relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – encourage this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I&#39;m afraid not.
- Firstly because I was able to see that, faced with a new situation, any structure finally manages, after many detours, to do as a matter of priority… what it has always done. !
- Then, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Coming from the great engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the American &quot;neurosciences&quot; and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by research institutes and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the &quot;levers&quot; (sic) of executive commitment, a recent Ipsos survey published in Le Figaro.fr confirms managers in a posture of mechanistic governance , unsuited to today&#39;s world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies supposes adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of achieving part of their dreams, of their ambitions, of their projects.
Currently, only studies resulting from functional motive analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa which allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their &quot;social performance&quot; and put their human resources management back &quot;in place&quot;.
They thus create a fertile ground for the concerted development of a robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: &#39;just war&#39; earns right-wing praise for Obama
The American right welcomed on Friday the speech made the day before in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner had defended the concept of &quot;just war&quot; against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives, who had mocked the awarding of the prize to Mr. Obama on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, a former vice-presidential candidate in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, Ms Palin, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party, told USA Today, adding that she herself broached the subject of war &quot;sometimes necessary&quot; in her memoir which have just been published.
War is of course the last thing in my opinion that Americans want to have to do, but it is necessary.
We must stop these terrorists over there, she said.
Mr. Obama, who inherited his predecessor George W. Bush&#39;s two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 soldiers in Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had done in Oslo &quot;a very good job&quot;.
I found that the speech was really very good, welcomed the former speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of &quot;the existence of evil in the world&quot; in the presidential statement.
By some side, I found this speech quite historic, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed during the radio program “The Takeaway”.
The former elected official, considered by some to be a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen &quot;a leftist president&quot; remind the members of the Nobel Committee &quot;that they would not be free and could not award a peace prize if the use of force did not exist&quot;.
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush converted columnist at the Washington Post, Mr. Obama gave &quot;a very American speech&quot;.
In addition to presenting himself as a &quot;citizen of the world&quot; as &quot;he always does&quot;, &quot;he spoke like an American president&quot;, reminding Europeans &quot;that they live in a security bubble that they did not create and they&#39;re not doing much to preserve it,&quot; Gerson said.
Among the few on the right unconvinced, a Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech &#39;dull, bombastic and uninspired&#39; on National Review Online. .
On the president&#39;s left, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When you wrap war in the notion of justice, you can easily justify the killing of innocent people, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained complimentary of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that Mr. Obama was awarded the Nobel prematurely, called his speech a &quot;blockbuster&quot; even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech &quot;should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression&quot;, ignited the Californian daily.
Mr. Obama &quot;delivered the speech that was needed&quot;, estimated the New York Times, judging it &quot;both dark and edifying&quot;.
Truckers: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the road sector unions and TLF, the only employers&#39; organization to have remained to the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening which puts an end to the call for a strike and the threat hanging over Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, was &quot;delighted&quot; with this agreement, after several negotiation sessions, which began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators left early Friday morning, hoping to sign the text of the agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
And this even if three employers&#39; organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting that started at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and for the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict &quot;would have been very detrimental for businesses&quot; and &quot;it was to be feared that it would disrupt the end-of-year celebrations&quot;, declared Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for a salary increase of 4% for the lowest salaries (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In hourly rate, for low wages, “we go from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It&#39;s not much, but we&#39;re starting from a very long way, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we will give the order to our activists that there are no blockages, no blockades of supply centers.
But you can always have a few holdouts who aren&#39;t happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed &quot;a good agreement&quot;, even if it was &quot;difficult to concede the increases on high salaries given the international competition&quot;.
According to him, the increases will be of the order of 170 euros monthly for low salaries and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed &quot;a historic agreement&quot;.
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke of &quot;an acceptable compromise&quot;.
The agreement also provides for the revaluation of travel expenses by 3%, and the holding of general statements of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will in particular make it possible to address the question of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that &quot;a reduction of 100 million euros in employers&#39; contributions&quot; was the subject of a government amendment to the amending finance bill for 2009, voted on Thursday night to Friday by the &#39;National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it &quot;in identical terms&quot;.
The signature of TLF allows the agreement to apply initially to companies that are members of this organization, and then to the entire profession, in the event of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done &quot;as soon as possible&quot;, assured Mr. Bussereau.
Opposition from employers&#39; organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a &quot;deal of fools&quot;, because the 100 million euros &quot;had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax&quot;.
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate urgently, not as a conclusion to a shared analysis, but so as not to upset the turkey eaters next Christmas Eve, lamented Unostra.
For l&#39;Other, the agreement risks &quot;digging the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months&quot;.
RER A: disruptions this weekend, unions unhappy with RATP proposals
Disruptions on the RER A, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue over the weekend, while a meeting on Friday on the 2nd day of the strike between unions and RATP management left them on their hunger for their bounty claim.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will only be trains between 10:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., at the rate of one out of two trains on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one in four trains outside the central section.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Préfecture, which will force travelers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, which expects 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that &quot;the RATP is making efforts to serve department stores&quot;.
The RER A crosses the Paris conurbation from west to east.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, around one in two trains ran during peak hours, and almost no trains during off-peak hours, as expected.
Like Thursday, there was no crowd on the quays, the Ile-de-France residents having organized themselves.
Thus in the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequented than usual, in particular due to the absence of middle and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he got up &quot;one and a half hours earlier, to be sure to arrive on time&quot;.
The Saint-Lazare station did not experience saturation, indicated the SNCF, which had planned a supervision of agents and law enforcement.
The RER A trains operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived at or left from Saint-Lazare station to reach the metros.
New general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, deemed &quot;meager&quot; by the unions, of a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The director of RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career development, etc.
This is not what the drivers want, who are demanding a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its bonus proposals in brackets, the CGT was indignant, stressing that the management &quot;was not damn to solve a problem while with the truck drivers and the SNCF it&#39;s done&quot;.
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for &quot;a broader examination of the conditions of exercise of the profession&quot;, specified the RATP.
This also made the unions say that the company &quot;didn&#39;t care about weekend users&quot;.
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a works committee at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the management, which until then had refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested &quot;for the sake of appeasement&quot; the meeting.
The conflict threatens to widen to RER B on Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
The unions are asking for a bonus of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros including 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line with a million passengers daily.
RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, receive from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros in bonuses, for staggered hours, Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves pro-Kurdish party, decision with serious consequences
Turkey&#39;s Constitutional Court on Friday pronounced the dissolution of the country&#39;s main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision risks greatly complicating the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a &quot;hotbed of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity&quot;, court president Hasim Kiliç told the press. , after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, indicated Mr. Kiliç, adding that 37 of the party&#39;s cadres, including its president Ahmet Türk and the MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party&#39;s assets.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that the deputies would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the &quot;directives&quot; of the Kurdistan Workers&#39; Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, assures that it has &quot;no organic links&quot; with the PKK but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court&#39;s verdict comes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures strengthening their rights, in an attempt to dry up Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders had claimed that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where numerous protests against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
As soon as the announcement of justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the large city in the south-east populated mainly by Kurds.
The security forces fired tear gas canisters and used water cannons, while demonstrators threw molotov cocktails or stones, with slingshots.
A hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk said that the decision of Justice would &quot;deepen the despair&quot;.
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, editor&#39;s note) by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of parties.
It doesn&#39;t solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedoing of the democratic opening launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can obviously expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snows may fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very harsh winter.
But the head of the road clearing and sanding service (FES) makes it clear that this is not to annoy citizens.
This is simply so that the agents can test the technique of the vehicles and learn to master them well.
And according to the meteorologists, it could well be for this weekend.
More than 300 officers and 120 vehicles stand ready to tackle the snow and ice.
The FES is following a very elaborate plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explains that as soon as it starts to snow in the city of Frankfurt and the temperatures drop below zero, large sandblasting vehicles travel along 20 main routes (known as A-routes).
This includes high-traffic streets, main thoroughfares, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire brigade access points, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and steep streets such as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES agents start their shift at three in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometers of roads must be salted with a road flux that adheres well, in a maximum of 3 hours.
This is why the FES service starts at 3 a.m. &quot;so that the roads are clear when the daily commuter traffic begins&quot;.
Where it becomes more difficult is when the snow starts to fall at 7:30 am.
This poses problems, the manager of the road clearing and sanding service tells us &quot;because no motorist is willing to let the salting vehicles pass&quot;.
Then, if it is no longer snowing, we take care of the access roads and feeder roads - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary roads and side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger is well aware that this always causes some complaints.
At five o&#39;clock in the morning, the foot team of the FES sets out to clear the areas deemed dangerous and the passages as a priority.
As for cycle paths, the services of the FES cannot generally take care of them.
Mr. Brauburger specifies that there is a special service in Frankfurt which is responsible for monitoring the condition of the bridges between 10 p.m. and 4:30 a.m.
As the ice forms very quickly on these surfaces, the salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
It also happens that the police call on this special service in case of need.
The cradle of the dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped measured about 2 meters long and 1.50 m high, its hind limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was provided with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended in claws in sickle and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and his colleagues report in Thursday&#39;s Science magazine, Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico which was at the time part of the emerged lands of the supercontinent, Pangea and was located towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says the discovery of the Tawa sheds new light on the evolution of early dinosaurs.
Indeed, it informs us about the family ties, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt undertook excavations in the company of other paleontologists, on the site of Gohst Ranch in northern New Mexico
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and member of the excavation team says that they sometimes found a dozen bones in a day, which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Triassic.
Scientists very quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
Excavations unearthed the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories concerning the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
Scholars named it Tawa after the Hopi Indian word for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is a quite exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare and are limited to a few incomplete bone fragments.
Not all paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, however he specifies that it confirms certain theories concerning the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, which makes it very difficult to classify the very first dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, at what time the saurians were divided into three major evolutionary groups: theropods (carnivores) which include the tyrannosaurus and the velociraptor which appeared later and from which descended the birds, the sauropods, quadrupeds with long necks , and their relatives and ornithischian herbivores, including species such as triceratops and stegosaurus.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is an early theropod.
This species shows an interesting ratio of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found clues that suggest that the Tawa hallae had small air sacs in its skull bones, just like birds that are the descendants of theropods.
These small pockets of air make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air sacs in its bones.
As the related line of huge sauropods also possessed air sacs and a light frame, it can be assumed that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
Since the earliest known dinosaurs lived in South America, researchers have concluded that saurians originated there.
Consequently, the three major evolutionary lines divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, that is to say all the emerged lands which formed the supercontinent Pangea.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who migrated, the researchers say.
Alan Turner of the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of Science Studies magazine says there were at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are of course some contradictions.
Martin Sander, paleontologist in Bonn says that there is an even older species, the silesaur, which lived in present-day Poland and which belongs to a group related to the dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give an erroneous view because there are in South America a large number of dinosaur fossils that have been preserved while we find practically none on other continents.
On the other hand, how the dinosaurs managed to become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era when they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the branch of the reptiles, still remains a mystery today.
During the Triassic period, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as with the ancestors of present-day crocodiles and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic, the dinosaurs spread all over the planet, thus favoring the development of many new species, while others, which were related to them, disappeared between the Triassic and the Jurassic.
However, such success does not last forever.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a mass extinction in which the dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles died out.
Or, the dinosaurs were better suited and so they were able to eliminate the competition in the field.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favored the development of a group of animals which had also developed during the Triassic and which since that time had vegetated in the shadows: these were the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are those of professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are those of lecturers from the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The evacuation by the police of the casino of the JW Goethe University of Frankfurt makes waves all over the planet.
278 professors and teachers from the JW Goethe University but also from other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English they condemn the intervention of the police demanded by the management committee of the university.
Last week, University President Werner Müller-Estler evacuated buildings occupied by striking students and teachers after walls and works of art were smeared with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories judge that the degradations did not justify &quot;such a violent intervention on the part of the police commando against the students and teachers who had organized their own courses&quot;.
The evacuation represents an &quot;unacceptable attack&quot; on the freedom of research and teaching.
Focusing attention exclusively on acts of vandalism only serves to &quot;delegitimize and criminalize protest&quot; and attempts to obscure the reasons for the mobilization.
The Steering Committee of the University has thus withdrawn from the debates which would however be essential.
The lecturers demand that the criminal proceedings initiated be immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants did not take part in the damage.
Legitimization of protests
Young people from the Verdi trade union in the service sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
The protests are just a legitimate expression of a growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional youth secretary of the Verdi union.
As for the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took up the cause of the action initiated by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the premises is completely unacceptable, she told the regional parliament in Wiesbaden last Thursday during the television program Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, expressed CDU deputy of the regional parliament Peter Beuth.
The opposition parliamentary groups SPD, the Greens and the Left (die Linke) did not share this opinion.
CSU uses painted walls as pretext to criminalize protests, says Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Linke)
Instead of thinking about the arguments and claims of the students, they are dismissed.
The Left Party has tabled a motion calling on the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of the police intervention.
The new “Silicon Valley”
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of research for secret armaments, under strict surveillance.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the town has the reputation of being the Soviet “Silicon Valley”.
Major micro- and nanoelectronics production and research facilities are located there.
Since September 2008 representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, Frankfurt&#39;s place of science – with university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a &quot;Protocol of Close Cooperation&quot;.
The signatories were the vice-mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of the project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a long-lasting scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian scientific companies wish to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and companies.
One finds there the Institute of electrotechnics of Moscow, the large firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The town was founded in 1958 as a &quot;planned socialist town&quot; for armament research.
Zelenograd (literal translation “Green City”) takes its name from the wooded hills in the heart of which the research centers are located.
The S21 project: a brake for Stuttgart
The scale of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be set high enough.
For its supporters, it is nothing less than “the new heart of Europe”.
If we want. S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a desperate chaos of construction sites for ten years. .
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 80s.
Terminal stations, with tracks terminating in the middle of the city, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of 19th century transport technology which acted as a brake on modern rail traffic because it was necessary to once plenty of time to move locomotives from rear to front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that&#39;s what you have to do.
This is why the main line stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart too: a train crossing station, which is located approximately halfway on the Main Trans-European Railway between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, hence the slogan &quot;Heart of Europe&quot;.
The realization of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
To tell the truth, the terminal stations no longer pose any real entry and exit problems since there are modern, reversible trains with railcars and a pilot car at both ends.
However, we are now launching the construction of Stuttgart 21 next to the new route of the inter-city line towards Ulm.
Regional and communal policies prevailed.
The railway company is involved because it is the taxpayer who bears the risk of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public company.
From an urban planning point of view, this project can be justified relatively well.
The result is an urban space which – judging by the computer-generated graphics of the planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The through station and the widening of the section are designed for passenger traffic which was attributed - and this is typical of the 80s - an enormous growth.
At the time there was no competition from cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should focus first on enhancing freight traffic because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than trucking on the road.
But the new layout, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the Swabia project.
This is the official number.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion is more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be lacking for other junction points and bottlenecks in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport mentions a total of sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the widening of the section through the Rhine valley by a good 180 kilometres.
Since 1987 this line has been built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent to press here fully on the mushroom.
But the S21 project has the effect of a braking shoe.
The Rhine Valley route is on its way to becoming the bottleneck for international freight traffic, right in the heart of Europe.
Government reviews airport ruling
In the regional parliament of Wiesbaden, the Land government raised the possibility of appealing against the judgment of the Administrative Court of Hesse concerning the ban on night flights.
Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to examine from a legal point of view the judgment delivered by the Administrative Court, which is a document comprising more than 400 pages.
The Court of Kassel had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations concerning the ban on night flights in the event that the project to build the landing strip northwest of Frankfurt airport is carried out .
Authorization to land for 17 planes between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the Land government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air pollution.
The coalition must have decided by January 4 whether it wishes to appeal the judgment.
The opposition criticizes this delay and tries to put pressure on the representative of the government so that he renounces the appeal to the Federal Administrative Court of Leipzig.
SPD parliamentary group leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel calls on the CDU and FDP to return to their pre-election promise to ban night flights. Otherwise, it will be considered as a total breach of a given word.
It&#39;s damn hard to be allowed to keep your word, Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the FDP&#39;s election slogan &quot;We keep our promises&quot;.
Minister Dieter Posch refutes the reproaches of Schäfer-Gümbel who claims that the Land government is trying to authorize night flights anyway by using &quot;advocacy and cunning&quot;.
It takes time to do an accurate legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision based on a &quot;quick first impression&quot;.
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the declarations of its fraction on the prohibition of night flights is completely erroneous.
US banks repay the aid allocated
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, are getting rid of their links with the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had repaid in full to the Treasury 45 billion dollars (more than 30 billion Euros), corresponding to the aid granted within the framework of the Tarp rescue plan.
The American television channel CNBC indicated during a report that Citigroup was also considering reimbursing the aid received.
Banking institutions are thus seeking to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of sums, such as, for example, the limitation of bonuses awarded to managers as well as the payment of higher fees.
The Bank of America launched a capital increase by selling securities to investors, which brought in $19 billion in new money.
The rest of the sum comes from the bank&#39;s coffers which are well filled thanks to the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, Chief Executive Officer of the Bank of America, expressly thanked American taxpayers: the injection of capital has considerably helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its abilities by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
Citigroup also plans to obtain money on the financial markets in order to free itself from state supervision.
The American bank could thus launch a capital increase of 20 billion dollars on Thursday, reported the CNBC chain citing banking circles.
The Citigroup spokesperson declined to comment on this information.
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had reimbursed the public funds from which they had benefited.
Accelerated election
In the end, everything went faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the dismissal of the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German channel ZDF, the successor has already been named.
The commission wanted to vote last night to make the nomination.
Peter Frey, who heads the Berlin editorial staff of ZDF, was the big favourite.
However, the channel did not wish to confirm – officially – the vote so as not to anticipate the procedure.
However, there also seems to have been a desire not to further harm ZDF intendant Markus Schächter if the proposal was not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter&#39;s candidate, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission out of 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of writing this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender&#39;s contract for five years, but this was rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had declared themselves in favor of the renewal of Brender and 7 others had voted against. Brender&#39;s impeachment was a bitter, if predictable, failure for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which has a majority on the Board of Directors, had already hinted several weeks before the vote that it did not want to reappoint Brender to his post.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse, who had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to allow the highly esteemed editor&#39;s contract to be extended, citing the fact that the ratings for ZDF news programs had fallen under Brender.
This is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, castigating the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
In the end there were even 35 experts in public law who had interfered in the debate and who considered that Koch&#39;s way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it won&#39;t help.
Peter Frey: who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (radio organ of Rhineland-Palatinate) and at the Frankfurter Rundschau (German daily newspaper with national reach).
In 1983 he became an editor at the ZDF, first of all at the current affairs magazine &quot;heute-journal&quot; (today&#39;s newspaper).
Then his career continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was assistant editor-in-chief at the time; then correspondent in Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was chief and presenter of &quot;Morgenmagazins&quot; (bimonthly information program presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the ZDF&#39;s foreign policy department and then chief of the Berlin editorial staff.
After Brender&#39;s disgrace, when he had just been elected journalist of the year by the specialized magazine Medium Magazine, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
Koch&#39;s opponent on the Board of Directors, Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty so that the intendant&#39;s personnel proposals cannot not be blocked by a biased political majority.
However, Beck does not plan to ask for the removal of the political figures who are members of the ZDF supervisory committees.
Peter Frey, Brender&#39;s likely successor had ably maneuvered with the Board of Directors by vehemently criticizing the commission in its decision to sack Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose him for the position of editor-in-chief without losing face, just as the Board of Directors could elect him without anyone suspecting him of placing a political supporter in office.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified left liberal.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for the students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: during a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the rectors&#39; conference, an agreement was developed stipulating that the working conditions of Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to lighten the weight of the exams: a single exam should enable the chosen study module to be closed.
In addition, the workload will have to be reconsidered to guarantee &quot;realistic and acceptable proportions&quot;.
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also undertaken to organize more flexible common structural prescriptions for the Bachelor&#39;s and Master&#39;s courses.
At regional level, there should be no different regulations from one Land to another.
Fewer exams
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Ministers of Education of the Länder and the rectors of universities have constantly in their mouths the fashionable expression: &quot;studyability&quot;.
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Council has decided to significantly reduce the number of certain exams: &quot;Each module should normally be able to be concluded with a single exam&quot;, can we read in a document of about thirty pages on the future conditions of admission in university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Council, says that by significantly reducing the examination load, we should be able to stop the slippages, which were considerably detrimental to studyability.
In addition, &quot;studyability&quot; should be the decisive criterion for the organization of studies in the future.
The modules as well as the content must be examined carefully to see if one cannot avoid this feeling of suffocation which one sometimes feels in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest RAID knowledge on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deceit.
Students should &quot;have the possibility and the leeway necessary to allow and encourage personal initiative&quot;.
The new regulations will concern access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be &quot;reaccredited&quot; every 5 years, which means, however, that it is not until 2015 that all cycles will have been examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory which depend on the accreditation councils created by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exerted some pressure on the Länder to weigh in on the agencies so that the curricula are not too heavy and the examination regime not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized colleges have already agreed with their regional ministries to take the appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only Land to have agreed to allocate more resources to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorial programs and strengthen educational guidance offices as well as examination offices and the international relations department.
The Länder and the universities provide a budget of 10 million euros for this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wishes to table in Parliament an amendment to the law on higher education establishments.
Following this, you will only have to pass one exam to complete your studies.
The organization of studies must be more flexible, moreover, it must be possible to guarantee the recognition of transcripts from other higher education establishments and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the &quot;studyability&quot; of all university cycles will have been examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the question of study conditions in the country.
The decisions were appreciated but criticisms were heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students has made it known that he would like the organization of educational policy no longer to take place in future &quot;behind the closed doors&quot; of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strike, the students as affected persons should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education have received the support of the President of the delegates of the conference of rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: &quot;the experience of the students is very useful to us&quot;, she said Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with which the HRK is working on a common reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. He claims the right and the possibility for each Bachelor graduate to enroll in a Master&#39;s cycle.
Andreas Keller member of the GEW steering committee also asks that the Länder assure today&#39;s Bachelor students that tomorrow there will be enough places for Master&#39;s studies and study conditions that are as good as possible.
The Länder must therefore hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of reducing access to the Masters.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is with these words &quot;Arrival in Germany and it&#39;s beautiful, almost no more control...&quot; that begins a work by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he thematizes in disturbing snippets of sentences, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany which gained freedom but at the same time lost its linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a German and English teacher in Bucharest and then a collection manager in a children&#39;s publishing house before settling in Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner has received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the coveted chair of poetry at the Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm artist house in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of noise in non-literary circles last Tuesday, during a congress in Munich, the theme of which was &quot;German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files&quot;.
Visibly unsettled and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he admitted to his fellow German-Romanian writers like Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informer for the political police Securitate.
Söllner received in 1989 the German language prize together with some of the participants.
Enlistment trials had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, &quot;therefore someone who has not been able to resist the attempts at intimidation by the Securitate sufficiently.&quot;
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoring of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her exemplary literary encounters with the mechanisms of power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken, and in particular the community of German authors originating from Romania, by a case which clearly shows the abysses and the baseness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as can be said according to current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, assures the scholar of literature Michael Markel after Söllner&#39;s confession and he refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded on his behalf.
&quot;He was able to get him out of all the tough situations back then,&quot; Markel said.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and in front of this audience was unexpected, however the admission of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret service is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper “Die Zeit”, after having read the 914 pages of her own file.
We can assume that the victims will have made speculations and will have sometimes guessed which real names were hidden behind the assumed names Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Contrary to Germany where in the meantime the consultation of Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of Securitate files is still very confused.
Systematic enlightenment has been continually thwarted and hampered in the past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the archives of the Securitate (CNSAS) but the restitution of the files has rather dragged on since.
Since 2005 there has been a law defining the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great is confirmed by the interview with a former Securitate official from Temesvar who, after the announcement of the awarding of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed himself in a very disdainful way towards the laureate.
She had a psychosis, and as it turned out, she had only been interviewed once.
The infamy of power thought it could express itself here, without any embarrassment, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Certainly, many inescapable questions are associated with the Söllner case as so often occurs in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now ? Who was robbed? The measured reaction of the listeners, by Söllner&#39;s admission, gives hope that the rest of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Champions League turmoil
It looked like a rep was arriving there, dressed to the nines straight from a cool Christmas party, which the sporting goods maker had flaunted its wares on when new VFB coach Christian Gross came on at midnight. minus a quarter in a Mercedes C-class, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier in his hand.
The man, whose bald head attracted attention, allowed himself to be led into the city which was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our 50-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he hadn&#39;t been drinking alcohol and he wasn&#39;t drunk with happiness either.
He had spent a pleasant evening but tomorrow he had to go back to work.
Because it was now that it was going to start.
The words of the Swiss who had just been hired three days earlier were clear: &quot;We have reached the round of 16&quot;, that is to say in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania” but we must not be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight not to fall back&quot;.
The &quot;big job&quot; awaits us on Sunday.
There, it is a question of repeating in Mainz the results of the Champions League on a daily basis.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that resurfaced after the three quick goals from Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Draw
The round of 16 of the Champions League (first leg 16/17 + 23/24 February/ second leg 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of the fulminant entry into office of Babbel&#39;s successor was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not limited only to the one who had brought luck, who had transmitted to the destabilized Stuttgart professionals, an unfailing motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to the players and told them they should focus on their strengths, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the &quot;plumber of souls&quot; - Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so goodbut which was no longer having effects with healer Babbel.
It unleashed a certain magic, admitted Jens Lehmann - supporter of Babbel -, &quot;in football when there is a new impetus sometimes things happen that you would never have thought possible&quot;.
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of injury break, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the &quot;phenomenon&quot; observed by a proverbial &quot;fresh wind&quot; and the working method of the new boss: &quot;C is someone who takes action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation”.
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
VfB Stuttgart have yet to turn the corner, warns manager Horst Heldt
At the moment, VfB Stuttgart mainly needs tenacity.
Like Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overstate the victory against a totally overwhelmed and weakened defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having a bad wake-up call four days later in Leverkusen with the 0-4, Khedira objected.
Horst Heldt, the manager, pointed out that they had achieved one of the objectives of the season but that there were others which were still a long way off.
We have not yet passed the difficult course.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday doesn&#39;t have the heart to celebrate, even after the first home win in three months, is due to the events of the weekend, which a TV interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann revealed. rebound just before the start of the game.
There are decisions other people make that Jens doesn&#39;t, Heldt countered, in response to Lehmann&#39;s scathing criticism.
He had accused management of style weakness and said they had decided to change coaches under pressure from pubertal fans.
Lehmann had also deemed it a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day off after matches had been taken away from him.
Lehmann&#39;s statements were &quot;marked by pure selfishness&quot;, Heldt shoved and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were no longer in danger of becoming friends for life, these two forties.
In any case, they agreed for everything else, that is to say that without the prior work of the group by the replaced coach, the strong sporting and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “a big part of the success,” Heldt and Lehmann retorted in unison – and even the man with the plastic bag nodded.
World Heavyweight Championship
Hot fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly verbally and gesturally provoked the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his title of world heavyweight champion according to the version of the WBC federation.
The judges unanimously won on points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title of world heavyweight champion.
The WBC federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a victory on points by the judges against American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko defends his title with honor since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously the Ukrainian had already twice won the title of world champion of the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately he did not achieve the long-awaited knockout.
Klitschko, won 39 times in 41 professional fights, had to admit defeat twice due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Bern Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko especially wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of his 2.02 meters, by his left counter.
Johnson, eleven centimeters shorter who, before the duel, had heralded the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the shots of the champion, thus preventing Klitschko from bringing into play his dangerous right counter.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mainly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows rarely reached the champion.
It is nevertheless the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, to have exceeded with Klitschko the distance of the twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko calling him an &quot;ugly zombie&quot; who &quot;isn&#39;t really capable&quot;.
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champ couldn&#39;t help but taunt Johnson by knocking his sunglasses off his face &quot;so he could see his eyes.&quot;
Fourth win since Klitschko&#39;s comeback.
Klitschko won again in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and recovered &quot;his&quot; WBC belt which he had previously had to give up without a fight.
This year, defending his championship title, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
“I just took a hit in this fight and I&#39;m in perfect shape,” Klitschko said of his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye canceled a match against Vitali Klitschko which was due to take place in September.
It seems that his promotion company is planning to play this match at Wembley Stadium in London now.
The Kunduz Affair
Frontal attack from the opposition: the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, has accused Defense Minister Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz Affair.
The SPD and The Left (die Linke) parties are asking the Chancellor for an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition criticized Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) for deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally &quot;formulated an untruth&quot; on the deadly strike of two tank trucks last September, said the leader of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the news program of the ARD channel &quot; Tagesschau&quot; (the 8 p.m. newspaper).
In other words, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given in complete disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in essence, the content of the report available to NATO and which was read by Mr. Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the objective of the strike was not in fact to destroy the stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured in the US air strike which was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak as soon as possible before the Federal Parliament and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Party Renate Künast are of the opinion that Mrs. Angela Merkel must make it clear whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Government and whether the chancellery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The government spokesperson categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellery has in no way influenced the army&#39;s interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices grew louder and louder to express doubts about the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to information from the newspaper SPIEGEL, the information they had given to Guttenberg concerning the attack on the tanker trucks was both correct and complete.
Officially, they concealed the existence of the NATO report and withheld certain embarrassing details from the Minister.
In the entourage of the two senior officials, however, it is suggested that they informed the Ministry of Defense of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein as well as a report from the military police.
The &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung&quot; reports that Wichert has in the meantime asked for a clarification of the facts in a letter.
So far he hasn&#39;t gotten a response.
Saturday, the Ministry did not wish to comment on these accusations and referred to the commission of inquiry of the Federal Parliament which was to be constituted the following Wednesday in order to shed light on the facts in question.
dream worlds
Some awake see images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in the mentally ill, or under the influence of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality become confused.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our darkened rooms, we can indulge unhindered in the wildest dreams and fantasies.
However, someone who, awake, experiences a dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in the mentally ill or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is in question: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, but which sometimes encourages the limits between dream, madness and reality to melt.
A conscious waking state, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, at worst madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect are distinct, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the dazes of the shamans, the psychoses and the hallucinations are attributable to very different processes. similar.
Hallucinations or delusions occur when the balance of neurotransmitter substances in the brain - first and foremost dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and achetylcholine - is disrupted and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts very often occur during schizophrenic psychosis.
The earth&#39;s force of attraction no longer has power over the person.
Since antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always looked into the relationship between madness and dreams.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of daydreaming; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 &quot;a great resemblance between madness and dreams&quot;, for Sigmund Freud the dream was even &quot;a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it &quot;.
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T is transformed into a character from a comic strip.
His body is two-dimensional with garish colors.
The gravity of the earth no longer has any power over him, he hovers at the level of the ceiling.
He feels a blow.
Behind him grimacing, winged devil creatures with bloody mouths showing their teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain all over his body.
Thunderous, mean voices howl, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear these voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. rips two cables from his stereo, loops them and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and passes the loop around his neck.
He jumps.
The buckle comes off.
Let this be a lesson to you, shout the voices in a chorus that tears his eardrum apart. &quot;Go to a clinic and get treatment!&quot;
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last one dating back 2 years, the first for almost 20 years.
She was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: schizoaffective, paranoid psychosis, in addition he is manic-depressive, he takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During the psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in their life from schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common illness after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the persons concerned can no longer distinguish between the inner world and the outer world, they find themselves in a state of hyper excitement, which means that they can suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices commanding, commenting or talking.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned in sensations.
Like dreaming, psychosis opens the floodgates to a flood of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
Reality perception in psychosis is subject-centric, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic finds himself right in the center of the situation, everything has a meaning centered on him.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is the reason why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they have no possibility of adjusting reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experiencing a hallucination once in your life.
Unlike dreaming, according to Fuchs, &quot;the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally retained&quot;.
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, alienation from experience takes place in a real setting.
Why our brains do this kind of antics is still a mystery to researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause anyone to momentarily lose sight of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies of twins have shown that genes aren&#39;t the only determining factors.
The researchers assume that those affected have minimal brain damage.
It is assumed that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what still remains unexplained is how the anomaly of the neural system occurs and moreover the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain heats up.
The crazy thing, says psychology professor Erich Kasten from Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others buy very expensive drugs to get rid of them. procure.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and illusory image phenomena for ten years: last year he published his results in a book called &quot;The unreal world in our head&quot;.
Hallucinations are part of the typical concomitant phenomena of psychoses but also of an impressive number of many other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer&#39;s disease or head trauma.
Surprisingly, even the brains of healthy people are prone to hallucinations under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that normally are inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions are overactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brain heats up but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like brain damage or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, heartache or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, a third of participants admit to having experienced a hallucination at least once in their life.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and she goes to high school.
A completely normal girl, to be honest.
If there weren&#39;t the images and the voices.
During recess, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long brown hair, speaks to him.
When she answers her classmates look at her in astonishment – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a whimsical dreamer but Sarah K is not dreaming, she is sure of it.
She is awake, hearing and seeing this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even sense his presence momentarily.
It&#39;s a pleasant feeling, she finds this young person sympathetic.
Am I crazy?, she wonders sometimes.
But she knows well that this youth and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are generally frightening.
Often the visions are heavy.
When she is in class, sometimes she can&#39;t follow the lesson because the teacher is just introducing a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is visibly explaining equations on the board.
At night the apparitions are generally frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she awaits the sleep that comes too rarely and far too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees, the grimacing faces or the girl with bloody gashes on her arms and legs lie before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she cries to these creatures.
She doesn&#39;t talk about it to her parents or her friends, they would think she was crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She graduated last year and she lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact with the psychologist Kasten over the internet, she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the likelihood is high that they will have hallucinations after a while.
I guess the brain not being busy enough, makes sure there is animation.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she had called dad since she was old enough to think was not her real father.
These are the same areas of the brain that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for actual impressions and sounds, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to tell the difference between illusion and reality. &quot;Every experience&quot;, according to Kasten &quot;takes place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real.&quot;
For Kasten, nocturnal dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychoses.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
This is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a special talent.
There is only one step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too centered on consciousness, we unfortunately quickly tend to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and head doctor of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious illness, painful but also containing something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a particular form of the modification of waking consciousness by dreaming.
Oneiroid experiences are very complex semi-dreams which are perceived as real by the one who lives them and which he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is in a waking state.
The oneiroid state of consciousness manifests itself during a trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies such as for patients with polyradiculopathy who, fully conscious, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and of the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation which affects his life, by his own imaginary world which is dissociated reality .
It is a state of mental limit between the dream and the hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a world change takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is in fact a matter of an intense form of means and interpretation, in a situation in itself intolerable, a capacity for organization which is given to us, to us men, so as not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Classen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book &quot;Change of Heart&quot; as a soul-saving action.
He is 49 years old, when his conscious leaves for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; meanwhile, his body is doomed to lie still in intensive care.
Claussen dives into a world he created from scratch, visits foreign places, travels through time. He sees himself as an old man bedridden in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lives in the Middle Ages among nobles who manufacture narcotics from blood.
He is kidnapped by a Greek on a motorbike who takes him to his country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snowfields of the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
He is completely absorbed in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is an entirely different state, he writes, describing what he experienced.
Unlike dreams, memories from mind travel are crystal clear and very detailed even years later.
We can even say that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience bursts the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneiroid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our internal representations of external reality are even in a waking state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten &quot;can cause a distortion of what we call reality.&quot;
An experience that can also be quite rewarding.
The first snows may fall
Burda
At 27, the children will take over the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen as CEO of Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told Spiegel newspaper.
The holding must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at 27 and are firmly determined to integrate into society, Hubert Burda, 69, told Spiegel.
All the details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
It will also be necessary to see if they are capable of it.
You can&#39;t impose your children on 7,500 employees without knowing if they have the capacity to take care of them.
It would wreck the kids as well as the business.
Burda announced last Thursday that he was stepping down as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was first responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently he took care of the Treasury sector, i.e. he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took over the head of marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finances.
Thus for the first time it is not a member of the family who is at the head of the Burda editions.
Burda&#39;s children are 19 and 17 respectively, her son Felix, who would be 42 today, died a few years ago.
Kallen&#39;s appointment also serves to bridge the next 10 or 15 years.&quot;
Burda specifies that the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in the families who let themselves be carried away by a bulimia of capital, who made enormous unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
It was never my strategy.
I never dreamed of universal power, Burda said.
I absolutely do not see myself in the role of preceptor of the country as Springer could be and I have no intention of being part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken on too much importance.
Integral beauty
Everything you could want, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is the objective that seems to have been set by El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the Callao shopping center (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, devoted to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious brands such as Hedonai, specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation and aesthetic treatment rooms, Luis &amp; Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d&#39;Or, which has a gym, or L&#39;Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food section, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent the relaxation area for two hours in order to organize your own &quot;Beauty Party&quot; with eight of your friends. and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, there are 250 m2 divided into 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual “coaches” who guide clients&#39; steps, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts with entering your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to perform our exercise program correctly.
Its director assures that 15 minutes (warming up and stretching included) are enough to work all the muscles of the body.
And, if after working on our body, we want to go to the hairdressing salon, the Luis &amp; Tachi brand has a room where we offer hair repair, luminosity or nutrition rituals, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the watchwords of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Various necklines
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our festive wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, acquires the electric car
The electrical company Endesa, in collaboration with the Ayuntamiento de Barcelona, has created “Oficina LIVE”.
This is a project aimed at developing and promoting the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The &quot;Oficina LIVE&quot; (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will put in place agreements concerning mobility, carrying out procedures, coordinating , presenting grants, etc.
Furthermore, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 “electric cities”
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joining the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
Its objective is to promote Research and Technological Development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
Among the latter are activities related to energy, and in particular to energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates with regard to the promotion of the electric car.
The company takes part in standardization groups on a European scale and has in progress a set of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees &quot;a future of tranquility&quot; for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees &quot;a future of tranquility&quot; for the Spanish automotive industry which, he recalled, is the country&#39;s main export sector.
During the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year in order to support the automotive sector.
&quot;Without a Competitiveness Plan for the automotive sector, today we would have a landscape of abandonment, of the closure of some of our main production sites&quot;, indicated the President of the government.
&quot;Thanks to this plan and the brands&#39; decision to stay in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can look forward to a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector&quot;, he said. -he adds.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), has dedicated 800 million euros to the projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which have mobilized an investment of more than 3,000 million euros.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of already existing products and processes.
Zapatero also highlighted government measures to support demand, referring to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with the autonomous communities and car companies.
According to the President, this plan has made it possible to reduce the average emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by 6% and has contributed to a “sharp increase” in registrations, which rose by “40%” in November.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Enduring Sportsmanship
Mazda intends to prove that sportsmanship is not at odds with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated on the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, called i-Stop, a device which, at least for the moment, is only available on the 2.0 petrol engine. of 150 horsepower.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good mark it obtained overall.
The details, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the whole formed by the control panel and the console, we see how Mazda has continued in the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This styling reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
This is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of the German products, and more particularly with the Volkswagen Golf, which all want to surpass.
Continuing with the interior, this compact Japanese car has more than enough roominess to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Added to all this is a large trunk with regular shapes.
The engine&#39;s automatic stop-start system, at least for now, is only available on the two-liter, 150-hp gasoline engine and with manual six-speed shifting.
This engine is a real treat. It stands out for its finesse, its low noise, its performance and the control of its consumption.
In fact, although the most demanded Mazda3 are the diesel models, those who do not cover a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for its great speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, in other words the one with the greatest number of standard elements.
Among the standard equipment, the lane change assistant (RVM) which eliminates the blind spot, the traction and stability controls, the cruise control, the photosensitive interior mirror, the trip computer on a screen of large size, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio, as well as 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly noteworthy.
In addition, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for 1,500 euros more, includes, among other elements, adaptable bi-xenon headlights and a BOSE audio system with disc charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is illustrated in particular by the quality of the materials used, by its behavior and by its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not do many kilometers per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the 2.0 petrol engine of 150 horsepower.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros for the model tested, the Sportive.
In return for this significant sum, the Mazda3 will offer us a large dose of satisfaction every day.
Luxury &quot;Premiere&quot;
LA covers the red carpet with sensuality embodied by Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled us more than ever, dressed in models as elegant as they were sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our “Pe”, as sophisticated as he is used to it, had opted for a dark “lady”.
The FonPeek Promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to look at your e-mail, without offering the possibility of even seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the Internet.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, less than half of what the iPhone data subscription costs, for example.
Given its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service, for six times the price of the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It&#39;s just as limited as its American big brother, but comes with a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, around 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or to desperately seek a cafeteria on Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to check your mail.
The idea of fixed price roaming is incredibly appealing and should have worked for a long time.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but for me, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
The repeated calls to order by the European Commission to offer affordable roaming tariffs throughout Europe have had a barely perceptible effect.
People outside their country of origin are hesitant to use the data, and there&#39;s a reason.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it&#39;s still curious that it&#39;s called Fon even though it doesn&#39;t have Wifi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators are starting to think differently and are studying different proposals allowing them make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other internet searches.
Without subscription and without hassle.
It is a connected device and you pay when you buy it and not every month.
And that&#39;s what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: a purchase option with lifetime access as Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I check my mail on my phone, thank you.
I simply want it because I believe it&#39;s a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle&#39;s favorite color
Yellow is, arguably, the first lady&#39;s favorite color.
If she went to the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, she has, in fact, chosen the same to accompany him in the second moment, without no doubt, the most important of his life: the presentation in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to their similar color, a greenish yellow with shiny reflections, both times the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabrics, and was adorned with a large embroidery or a collar.
So much so that at first glance, it would seem that the first lady of the United States is following in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to put on the same outfits.
But the fabric the two sets are cut from makes them very different.
If for taking office it was a thick lace, on the other hand, in Oslo she wore a printed velvet.
The accessories are also different: green shoes with medium heels for the first occasion, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now raised whereas she wore it loose the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had work-related problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study “Fertility and professional career of women in Spain”, carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, carried out on 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen their professional careers limited because of maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the start of life as a couple and the number of children, whether the woman works or not and the type of job held.
Those who have no activity outside the home, work part-time or have an unstable job, form a couple earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with a stable job, mainly in the public sector, postpone the entry into life as a couple and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with a permanent job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after settling into a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. “These data show that women with a stable job needed more time in their lives to obtain it, which led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of job exercised largely influences maternity, but less so the date of the start of living together,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widens the gap between women&#39;s age at marriage and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the later they marry and have their first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group aged between 35 and 49, those with elementary and higher education respectively became mothers for the first time at ages 25.1 and 32.1 on average.
“Another distinction also appears between women, depending on their level of education.
While those with elementary education get married and have their first child before finding a stable job, those with intermediate or higher education reverse this program and give priority to obtaining stable work such as prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child,&quot; says Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L&#39;Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will embody the image of several of the brand&#39;s products, singing the universal motto &quot;Because I&#39;m worth it&quot;.
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other celebrities registered with L&#39;Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
For men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline&#39;s companion in Lost).
British fashion awards
The British have a lot to say in the world of fashion.
Its greatest representatives, creators and models, past and present, gathered for the annual presentation of their prize, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vincent&#39;s poker ace
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) some thirty &quot;x-rays&quot; of writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
He doesn&#39;t do it according to foreseeable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent spares neither fears nor illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to reading and re-reading.
I leave you here some snapshots.
On Albert Camus: &quot;In its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the very one that I felt without naming it: pleasure against fatal destiny, morality without guilt and innocence without any god. »
On Samuel Beckett: &quot;Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what was in his blood, not in his head, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, devoid of meaning, like the blade of a knife who nearly killed him. »
On Graham Greene: &quot;Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion which lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege which consisted in reaching heaven by the way of perdition. »
On James Joyce: “The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand meter peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed by the north face, on which the best mountaineers again and again let go. »
On William Faulkner: “He was a strange guy.

A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the town of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a half-blood , saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they kicked him twice which left the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what fun there is in gratuitously attacking a small defenseless animal which, moreover, was on a leash.
To this must be added the indignation of a lady who was walking quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since a fanatic who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, anyone weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., a Tuesday like any other, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog moaned all day.
We have of course lodged a complaint at the local police station even if we doubt that it will be of much use and in order not to touch sensibilities, we just want to specify that the cowardly assassins were Spanish.
The indignation led us to denounce this fact.
We don&#39;t understand what happens to young people that they find it amusing to wantonly mistreat a defenseless animal that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We don&#39;t know where the good education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for wearing a helmet
The tire manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, mainly among the youngest motorcyclists, as indicated today by the two structures .
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, since it is the only protective element that can prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of an accident in two wheels.
Michelin said the campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which &quot;goes beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products&quot; and said it contributes to this objective by other actions of an educational and informative nature.
This new campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets on two wheels, under the motto &quot;To be or not to be&quot;, will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to ensure the widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety &quot;is a constant concern&quot; for the company, because as a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are on the rise
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market is starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, what is more important, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to figures from the employers&#39; union manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of the dealers.
However, the good news should be qualified, since the reference used for comparison, November 2008, was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
Consequently, despite last month&#39;s rebound, the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if we add up all the vehicles that fall into the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, pickups, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95,853 have been sold.
The big clouds that affect their demand the most have not dissipated. Indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions implied by the limitation of bank loans, we must add other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
Faced with this situation and unlike passenger vehicles, aid for the purchase of the 2000E was of little use.
In addition to private individuals, self-employed persons and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle weighing less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of Co2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer can also benefit from it, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, we again recalled the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The association of dealers predicts a year 2010 similar to the one that is coming to an end, for which it calculates a fall in sales (of passenger vehicles and 4x4s) of 19%.
Emergency brake assist is now mandatory
As happened with ABS anti-lock braking system and as will happen with ESP stability control, emergency brake assist systems will be a mandatory feature on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a waiting period has been set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear impacts.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the kick given by the driver.
But the latter does not always maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study by car component manufacturer Bosch, a third of drivers involved in an accident were unable to apply the brake before the collision, and half of them did not benefit from all his strength.
Up to 1,100 crashes
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, demands the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of element, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is calculated that one in four claims with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although a collision is unavoidable, the device exerts the maximum force on the brakes in order to minimize the damage.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April – probably on the 8th – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the relief plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, intends that each point of the plan has been approved beforehand by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will be submitted first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, is postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, we assure that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with possible new buyers.
One could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but Dutch sports car maker Skyper, backed by Russian group Converg, is gaining momentum.
In the event that there is no agreement with either of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
Driving the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their latest and precious jewel, Porsche engineers started from the Boxster S and succeeded in slimming it down to just under 80 kilos, which leaves the scales at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to do without, in the first place, the automatic roof which was replaced by a manual canvas roof, allowing a reduction of 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors like those of the GT3, another 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the gas tank from 64 to 54 liters, 7 kilos saved, to mount sports bucket seats, another 12 kilos, and with light 19-inch tires, five kilos.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, saving another six kilograms, and replaced the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilogram.
Although the model is also available with the PDK dual-clutch transmission, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual transmission model, mainly on California secondary roads, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behavior can only be described as irreproachable.
The decrease in weight does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it&#39;s been a long time since we tested such a small and light model which, at the same time, guarantees so much safety when cornering, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles at low speed for the time necessary, until we ask him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again…
That&#39;s all we wanted. Thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as it is precise, the car will do what our hands on the wheel indicate.
And she will do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be enhanced with the &quot;sport&quot; option or thanks to a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera .
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether at a standstill or during recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The surfaces of the roads we drove the Boyxster Spyder were quite rough, but the car handled potholes well.
The electronic assistants barely made any presence on the whole trip, while on some turns we found ice in the early morning and gravel later in the morning.
All in all, an ultra-light car that is fun to drive and is much more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
“Bag Girl”
A close friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the house&#39;s fashion shows, the singer displays her bad girl face with as much composure as her Chanel bags.
More than a “Bad Girl” or an “It Girl”, she is a “Bag Girl”.
Baskonia secure victory in Israel
Caja Laboral secured a resounding 91-82 triumph on their visit to the tough Maccabi Electra ground, despite the many absences Dusko Ivanovic&#39;s side suffered. She is thus at the top of her group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight three-point baskets was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
The Vitoria team was able to make up for the significant absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of commitment and collective work, even if they had to wait until the end to claim victory.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 three-pointers scored, largely determined the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blues and reds, who took the lead from the start.
The fact that the Vitoria team&#39;s first four baskets were scored from the perimeter, hinted that they had jumped onto the Israeli court with hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same note, but the Alava team chose the inside game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, who was received with cheers and applause back at his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as his team&#39;s best player, with 13 points scored, although Splitter&#39;s &#39;minus six&#39; rating already hinted that this night was not going to be the Brazilian&#39;s best.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was decided, far from it, and the Avala team wanted to remind the Vitoria team that you don&#39;t win if easily on their ground, and thanks to &quot;the hand of Elias&quot;, they succeeded in entering the match.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the yellow taking advantage of the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic&#39;s players, injured but far from dead, needed to chain a few skilful actions to get some fresh air, and that&#39;s when Mirza Teletovic&#39;s submachine gun appeared who, with three three-point baskets consecutive matches and the help of English and Ribas put the scoreboard back to a reassuring score (54-67), which the locals managed to accentuate at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Avala&#39;s team went out to go for broke in the final period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) advised that they weren&#39;t going to let anyone take what they had deserved in the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign themselves and tried to support it from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for fouls, Ivanovic&#39;s players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis closed in the last minute (80-85), the game was already over and victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time this season.
Wounds keep Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and gave them the lead in Group B of the Euroleague, in a match marked by the absence of Unicaja players, especially in the interior game (Freeland , Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team were not put off by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship pavilion or by the stature of the rival, undoubtedly one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. Aggressive defense and three consecutive three-pointers, two from point guard Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio that dazzled the home side 12-18 in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the home side&#39;s arsenal with inside play from Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis helped turn the score around 22-20, in the thirteenth minute , when an action, the start of a fight, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek side began to function showing their superiority on both sides, as England pivot Joel Freeland&#39;s injury outing and Carlos Jiménez&#39;s three personal fouls weighed on Unicaja.
The inside players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their three-pointers, made it 44-32 in the nineteenth minute.
An impossible ascent
The third period was particularly offensive for Olympiacos who, despite 19 losses, proved to be superior and even managed to equal the difference of the match disputed in Malaga 66-48, in the twenty-seventh minute, staggering the head of the group .
Unicaja were trying to overcome the absences and the last outing of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured during the match.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, the three-point baskets of Cook, and the support of Lewis, left some hope with 66-57, in the thirty-first minute.
But victory was next to impossible as Olympiacos proved relentless when the players pressed and showed their centimeter superiority in the area.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the score to 81-62 in the 37th minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting victory for Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid according to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can find out what salary they deserve based on their profile, thanks to a new app from Trovit, the search engine with the most property, job and vehicle classified ads in Spain.

For a week that the application has been running, the search engine has detected that, in general, the Spanish worker &quot;feels poorly paid&quot;, explained in a press release the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the lowest paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 euros gross per year and a French person 31,059, while a Spaniard receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives 34,247 euros gross annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.

Brazil sets date for Zelaya&#39;s departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya&#39;s stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The overthrown president will have to leave the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of his mandate.
Francisco Catunda, charge d&#39;affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that &quot;Mel&quot; knows he has to leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21, before that date. .
“He is aware that he must leave on January 27, at the end of his mandate, he must seek another destination”.
The channel also quoted the former representative, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the established deadline: &quot;My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government&quot;, said Zelaya by telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, since Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you so much
After rosy days since last spring, during which asset inflation was the dominant note in the markets, uncertainty is again surfacing there, which is not surprising since this is their state. natural, in an environment where agents make decisions about an inherently uncertain future.
The remedy employed by central banks to stabilize the markets has been to monetize debt by directly buying assets and indirectly by giving abundant liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct asset purchases have been practically finalized and, without questioning their maverick liquidity policy, are beginning to put a little sand in the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their one-year auction next week.
Consequently, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain an economic stimulus without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction in risk premia.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads are rising again, although they remain well off the paranormal levels they reached at the start of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is once again affected.
There is again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the havens chosen by investors, causing a widening of the differences between the countries of the euro zone and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s threatened a further downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not bad for silencing the advocates of moral hazard, who were again trying to provoke a conscience call among the global economic policy makers who had curbed the destructive effects derived from the limitation of credit on job destruction, when what should be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the emirs to regain its place of power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot of roses.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member country of the euro zone to not respect its commitments.
What is logical, on the other hand, is that Ecofin encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and made its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transient risk premia, after some excesses in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt spreads increase in line with European corporate bonds, we need not worry.
If European spreads narrowed and ours continued to rise, then this would be an idiosyncratic Spanish risk.
The Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s affair is an anecdote. When our forecast indicators force most research services to anticipate their recovery models and revise their forecasts for 2011 upwards, with the OECD and the European Commission, which come back to the charge with a Japanese model for the he Spanish economy does not bode much hope for their warning.
Again, this looks like an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now “caution is the mother of surety”.
Connected sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where Spain&#39;s energy strategy for the next two decades is being discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán outlined for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommittee, behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros until 2020 and 60,000 million more between that date and 2030, in the event that the nuclear power plants currently in operation would remain in operation open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million but to 95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the question changes, and the power will have to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal-fired power plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this area, he considers that 18,000 MW more is needed, with other “support energies”.
Galán, who believes that the sustainable economy bill that the government has just approved is in line with what his company is demanding, did not wish to attack the royal decree aimed at encouraging the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policies of the fight against global warming.
According to him, there is &quot;a clear long-term bet&quot; in this direction, despite the &quot;punctual&quot; measures, as the president of Iberdrola described them.
Anyway, Galán believes that the decisions to invest, although they are long-term, must begin to be taken, because they take a certain time to reach maturity and a framework stable remunerative is necessary to approach them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling contract at ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, will play the role of privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for goods services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a collaboration protocol to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Center.
The alliance plans an investment of 20 million until 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the centre&#39;s tasks will be to carry out research on energy efficiency on motorways and at airports.
Acciona disputes its first motorway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first highway concession in Australia, a market in which it is already working as an energy company and water manager.
The site at stake is a tunnel estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5 kilometer long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, is the option for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and motorway concessionaire.
The town hall of the city wishes to be able to dispose of it by the end of 2014.
After having chosen the public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, within the framework of a business plan under the supervision of Erns &amp; Young, the local administration already has a list of the finalists who will be in charge of the construction site and the operation of the toll.
Pending the presentation of their offers next May, the planned investment amounts to 1,700 million Australian dollars (approximately 1,047 million euros) and in the last phase three consortia are competing, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in smooth running, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium is fighting, with the presence of the British company Laing O&#39;Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium to pass the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major projects and privatizations, but entering it represents a great difficulty, if not by acquiring a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which still remains a step not validated for the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS has only just conquered a place in this market with its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Millionaire Assets
Acciona is betting on a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, in which it already has a large presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, that of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for erecting and managing the watermaker in Adelaide, with a budget of 700 million .
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of the synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The underground toll road, promoted by the City of Brisbane Office of Infrastructure and said Northern Link (Northern Link), is set to link the Western Toowong Freeway with the Ring Road at Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometers of tunnel. It is the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the auction will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December of next year.
Although this toll lane will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, construction is not expected to be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include twice two lanes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its financing.
Brisbane already offers work for Hochtief
Australia continues to do well for Hochtief, who yesterday mentioned winning a government contract valued at $154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national high-speed fiber optic network.
This intervention will provide 400,000 people with fast Internet access and will provide work for the German company for 18 months.
The company also sold the construction project for the 27-storey King George tower in the city of Brisbane. Work has not yet started and Hochtief has concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, more precisely in Manchester, she will share with Laing O&#39;Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1 kilometer long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia, for an amount of 64.5 million euros.
The company obtained this contract a few days after being given the task of expanding the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of construction is scheduled for early 2010 and its completion will take 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore awarded Renfe ad
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the Sra agency. Rushmore, for a budget of around three million euros per year, said the rail operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was chosen from among 16 agencies that applied to the tender organized by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA, which has been responsible for creativity for the past three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for designing and producing the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Telecom to curb competition
France&#39;s competition regulator has fined France Telecom €63 million for its anti-competitive conduct in the country&#39;s Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, by tariffs and by consumer loyalty programs on the sidelines of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company, accumulates more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it puts to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has also been increased because the competition authority considers that France Telecom has committed similar offenses in the past and is therefore a repeat offender.
An app store
On the other hand, the mobile telephony subsidiary of the French company has followed in the footsteps of other operators and opened an Internet application store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission. .
Initially, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has brought Real Madrid and Barça 476.4 million since its inception
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for clubs since its birth in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona won 467.4 million, which places them in third and fifth position among the clubs that have pocketed the most money in this competition.
Manchester United top the list.
Manchester United top the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League doesn&#39;t just bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
Indeed, the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created, during the 1992-1993 season, according to information from the &#39;.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third on the continent to receive the most money for its participation, and the only one, with AC Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, current defending champion and last winner of the old European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, moreover, charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, when it comes to the money brought in by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while the Italy won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for distributing the money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to earn 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this sum, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs which took part in the classification matches (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, in addition to 550,000 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those who reach the round of 16 receive three million each, the eight teams who reach the quarter-finals receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will earn 9 million, against the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, under fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and at most 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barca pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are the variable payments, to which 337.8 million are devoted.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the largest, and has four designated places.
The previous year&#39;s champion gets 40% of the allocated money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played during the current year&#39;s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday listed the details of the share purchase offer by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not require him to launch a takeover bid (OPA) for all of the securities.
Concretely, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share, which will be disbursed over 10 years and which will be remunerated at a rate of 1% per year for this deferral.
Yesterday, shares of Sos closed at 1.85 euros; Nueva Rumasa&#39;s offer therefore values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to indicate their interest in selling the securities.
The CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although the company of Ruiz Mateos affirmed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it took place, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay out of potential takeover bids and the legal back and forth of its former directors, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, it announced the election of María Luis Jordá as internal audit director. .
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a leading position in the food company.
This is a newly created position that will report directly to the Group President.
And it is not free from controversy, since the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal new embezzlement cannot be ruled out.
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) declared yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the embezzlement of 212 million without knowing the destination.
The CNMV authorizes the exclusion takeover bid for Paternina presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion takeover bid presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9th.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were adjusted to the standards in force and that it considered “sufficient” the content of the explanatory sheet presented, following the modifications applied on December 2 last.
The CNMV clarified that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of the share capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading. on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares were tied up, and could not be transferred in any way until the offer was finalized, the price of which he indicated had been set by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the standards in force.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, auto repair shops are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered an accident are brought to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of the repair.
Every claim is different, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complex job.
Calculating by hand the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the most recent IT tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
It is for this reason that almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for damage assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers as a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of estimates are made with its products.
Other companies competing in the area of assessment tools and industry insights are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is constantly increasing, so that in the last five years, more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car hits the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very difficult job, because you have to catalog each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and enter its price.
In addition, an &quot;intelligent&quot; graphic image of each model is created on which the different parts of a passenger car can be clicked.
If it&#39;s a high-selling model, the job can be ready in a week if the process moves very quickly.
If it is a low-selling automobile, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of the cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have information on, for example, Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghinis.
Regarding vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and development of databases, Audatex has eight centers spread throughout the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (generally mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million each year to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million records are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The elaboration of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give it different uses and to offer various products.
The most frequent application concerns repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing breakage parts or for calculating the market or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that provides information on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
Looking at the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard claims assessment solution for adjusters.
They include cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it takes into account repair times estimated by the manufacturer or paint schedules.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, at most ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of appraisals, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glasses, and AudaSubastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows bidding on vehicles declared as salvage.
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, carrying out geo-demographic analyzes or knowing common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a certain brand went to the garage for a breakdown or how many suffered serious claims for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to official parts, prices and times from the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of claims, breakdowns or car maintenance.
The GT Assessment Guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 adjusters and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased at the rate of 20% per year over the past three years, and it made a turnover of 10.8 million euros in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, it began its internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
For its part, Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established itself in Spain in 1979.
According to company sources, 62% of its turnover is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, 3,000 of which are in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will amount to 557 million dollars, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed on the stock exchange for 1,000 million dollars, today its shares are valued at a total of 2,400 million dollars.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s benchmark index.
Internet auctions of wrecked cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of damaged cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The operation involved a cost of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the capital of the company, which could expand next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and sales service is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, appraisers, rental companies, garages, scrapyards and professional sellers who must be registered before starting to perform operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 sellers and 4000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and in the Spanish market 100 new ads are published every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been withdrawn can no longer be driven, but on the other hand, certain parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Classic cars can be re-registered, although they have been withdrawn, after complex procedures.
Garage quote in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company guarantees that the user obtains an estimate in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create an estimate and generate it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are required.
Once the model to be repaired has been identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears, then the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor cost, markups or discounts, and then print the quote for delivery to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a catalog of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include estimated labor times.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
Currently, the Audatex company is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see very favorably, since it will allow, for example, to select a door and rotate it to see the internal face.
