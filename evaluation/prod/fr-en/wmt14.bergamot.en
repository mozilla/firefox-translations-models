The NSA case highlights the total absence of intelligence debate
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French Government, which on the one hand off in public by summoning the US ambassador on 21 October, and on the other the other prohibited the flight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the rumor of the presence on board of Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French Government.
When François Hollande phones Barack Obama or Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the US ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is the scale of US surveillance of all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of Le Monde a few weeks apart, on the one hand, the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and, on the other hand, a condemnation of the NSA's listening to the Quai d'Orsay?
Would it not be like a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral position, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows every citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks unveils the analysis by US diplomacy of political or other issues around the world, we consider that, given American power, this is an important insight.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is by no means to outrage us with this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA concerning terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we forsake American collaboration?
The very powerful technological tools of interception by the United States, but also by France, have been officially established for a total of ten years, have been formally justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States in particular have established quasi-daily cooperation and information exchange procedures, which are described on both sides as essential.
For example, Mohammed Merah's presence in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French thanks to the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data about the Sahel region to US services, and, in return - as has already been quickly said - the Americans can give information to French people about other parts of the world.
Therefore, the substantive issue behind this NSA case is not so much the capacity or the right of countries to acquire interception tools, as the question of the total absence of a preliminary debate, particularly in Parliament, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and, ultimately, the question of infringements of freedoms.
What is the real risk of the United States? A deterioration in its image?
No matter how much we denounce them, I do not see how they can be punished.
The risk faced by the Americans can be twofold.
The first is when their allies -- and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest peak in their state, have been monitored.
This is the case in Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been tense.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in the light of revelations, to entrust their confidential data to US providers subject to US law, and thus to the NSA’s hold.
Finally, the vast movement of revelations by media outlets around the world, which is helping to start a debate on previously virtually non-existent intelligence surveillance practices, could prompt legislators, including US ones, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister, ambienced
The US President was scheduled to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, in search of US aid to fight the strongest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq experienced its deadliest month in October in five and a half years, according to figures published by the Iraqi authorities on Friday 1 November.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations has even a higher death toll, with 1,979 dead and 1,902 injured.
This violence is becoming increasingly lethal despite heightened security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the Shia-dominated government of Nouri Al Maliki.
The total number of deaths in October is highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of US troops, the level of violence raised fears of a new conflagration while neighbouring Syria was in the throes of a civil war.
The bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot in the street or even at home, and the security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and of being the target of unjust arrests, has fostered this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, further violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars bomb north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), an Al-Qaida-affiliated group (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "global war" against Al Qaeda.
The violence is at the center of the talks in the United States of Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received by President Barack Obama on Friday, two years after their previous meeting, on 12 December 2011.
At the time, the US President, who was elected on the promise to end military engagement in that country, painted an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington, D.C., Nouri Al Maliki has increased the number of meetings with the executive, and the elected representatives of Congress.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shia, attributing him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his “sectarian and authoritarian policy”.
They also demanded that Barack Obama make it clear to Nouri Al Maliki that "Iran's pernicious influence in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship".
French police will arrest Anderlecht supporters who came in a way other than with RSCA buses
The French police have decided to lay down strict rules concerning the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday, said Marie Verbeke, spokeswoman for the Brussels-noon police zone, on Friday.
Belgian supporters of the RSCA who wish to go to this Champions League match will have to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former Rekem border crossing to the PSG stadium," the spokeswoman said.
The process will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters had an intention to travel to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture reported that measures had been taken to make arrests or even police custody," Marie Verbeke said.
The Vatican probes on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major survey around the world on how parishes handle sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce, and same-sex couples.
The survey asks participants how priests care for gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the bonds of marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national bishops'consion, with instructions on how to get as many answers as possible.
The information will serve as an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokeswoman for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide how to sound parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the poll on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
The 37-year-old who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy de Surrey School faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan was charged with hostage-taking, kidnapping, threatening, carrying a weapon with a dangerous purpose, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police officers involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the security conclusion of this incident," Corporal Bert Paquet said in a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to go to court on Friday.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine could suppress the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine dependence for life.
Further tests were needed before starting human trials, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, said the early signs were encouraging.
“We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all the methods now available on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the cells of the liver, which then begins to produce a steady flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track down all the nicotine molecules in the blood system and neutralise them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from having his dose of nicotine.
During the tests, the vaccinated mice which were then given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But mice that had not been vaccinated "were soothed," the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
Experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines have been shown to be ineffective as they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so frequently so that antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addiction to nicotine.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and it can help them lose their bad habit,” he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but pointed out that much more research was needed.
Egyptian Islamists on the Street to denounce Morsi's trial
Anger is rife in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of the deposed President Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to call for the restoration of the country's first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial underscotism by this Muslim Brotherhood activist.
So far, no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the documents in the case.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial protesting a pro-Morsi, and it is he who is supposed to have Sisi tried, not the opposite.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, the Nahda massacres, and the Republican Guard massacre.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 demonstrators were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed to the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
One case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in Val-d'Oise, which is clearly of foreign origin, although France has been free from indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on 25 October in Argenteuil and died on 28 October.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
'An epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and care for persons who could have come into contact with this kitten between 8 October and 28 October inclusive,' says the Ministries of Health and Agriculture.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
'In humans, preventive treatment of human rabies, given after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective,' says the statement.
The ministries are now calling on persons who were allegedly bitten, scratched, scratched or licked on a mucosa or on a skin damaged by that kitten or whose animal had been in contact with that kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
"France has been free of rabies since 2001, this kitten or the mother has been imported from another country, not unharmed", according to the communiqué.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last "indigenous" case of rabies occurred in December 1998 on a fox and that "France was officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE)".
One case of rabies on a bitch illegally imported from the Gambia had been recorded in 2008.
'Rabies is a fatal disease if it is not treated in time,' the ministries are reminded and it is transmissible for almost 15 days before the onset of the first symptoms of the disease.
the disassembled Pont-de-Buis gantry
The eco-tax portico-tax in Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled on Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived on site shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic in the national area was diverted in the process.
The decision to dismantle, announced by the prefecture of Finistère on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, the manager of the gantry.
It is the last of the three eco-tax porticos in working order in the department of Finistère, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Australian woman appeals her prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old resident of Sydney, sentenced to 15 days'imprisonment in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the trial and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a Phuket Provincial Court on 15 June after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who were controlling her, assaulted her early on Sunday, 10 June.
However, video surveillance tapes later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before they confessed to inventing the story of all kinds.
She was detained in a cell at the local police station prior to the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days'imprisonment in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a women's prison.
This is the daughter of former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who called on the Canberra Foreign Office to help her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
“Obviously, we have had a scary time, but we hope to bring it home safely as soon as possible,” said Tunks.
Bamford appealed the judgement and was released after a bond of 50,000 baht.
In Australia, the press stated that, in the meantime, it was on holiday in the Krabi region of southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the sentence of up to two years'imprisonment and an incarceration in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to restore its deteriorated image to tourists, which could lead to acquittal.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are sued for Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents began an avalanche of patent lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company it topped the pole at the auction of patents that took place after Nortel's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for EUR 4.5 billion, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other patent infringement companies before the United States Assize Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow advertising to be displayed in connection with search terms on the Internet, the findings of the lawsuit have indicated, which is the core business of Google.
It was not possible to reach representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that run under Google's Android operating system, which competes fiercely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of 900 million euros for Nortel's patents.
Google increased its offer several times, eventually offering 4.4 billion dollars.
After losing Nortel patents to Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for an amount of 12.5 billion dollars, a market partly based on Motorola's patent library.
“Although it failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auctions, Google violated and continues to violate the patents,” the findings of the lawsuit indicated.
Rockstar claims greater damages against Google, as he claims that Google's patent infringement is stubborn, according to the plaintiff.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state anti-corruption regulator.
Former New Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denied having changed the policy of trade leases at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid had lobbied several state ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a café after their expiry in August 2005, without a call for tenders.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid in these properties, following the testimony of the former Deputy Secretary-General of Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, Thursday.
In the years of discussions in 2005, the government has lobbied for tender.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the Bank for Circular Quay's leases, which reported to the Obeids around EUR 2.5 million per year, were renewed without a call for tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tenders.
But he denied having changed his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid who, acknowledged Mr. Tripodi, called for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations submitted to ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, M. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ports Department after working under Ms. Obeid's command in the Ministry of Fisheries.
“Was the subject discussed during these telephone conversations the development of trade lease policy?”, Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr. Tripodi.
“No,” replied Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we talked about, but at least that wasn't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board aircraft (but not make a call with their mobile phones)
Airlines passengers will be able to use their door-to-door electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not talk on their mobile phones – under the much-anticipated new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the crew training manuals and the rules on the storage of aircraft to be in compliance.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
“Based on the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers have to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other aircraft as soon as the aircraft's doors are closed.
They were not supposed to turn them on again until the plane reached an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gave the green light.
The passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft when the aircraft is dropped before landing and do not switch them again until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground bearings, said the FAA.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was pleased with these changes.
“Once the new policy is being implemented safely – and we will work closely with carriers to do so – it will benefit everyone,” Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like “room supervisors” when it comes to this question.
But it will still be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and text messages or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other aircraft in airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game that was played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was rushed off from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his aircraft while the aircraft was being parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be tidy because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones is the Federal Communications Commission and not the FAA.
FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transport safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were still considered to pose a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone relay antennas if they are used on board," said Rosenker.
An industry advisory committee established by the FAA to examine the problem last month recommended that the government authorize a wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there are no valid security reasons for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to apply as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to turn off their aircraft, or do so deliberately.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 as a result of reporting on interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadget of the time.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines have been enabling their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems also with better interference.
The vast majority of airliners are expected to allow wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power transmissions than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only issue minimal transmissions when you turn a page.
But the transmissions are stronger when the devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is among those pressing for easing restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's executives loaded an airliner from Kindle e-book readers and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This has inspired the members of the FAA Advisory Committee with mixed feelings as to whether or not the use of the devices is at risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed that interference from the aircraft was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to request passengers to switch off their aircraft during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense arrangements for technology-enabled travellers.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety,” said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the US move to soften the rules on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to US carriers for a change of their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their aircraft during critical flight phases provided they are in "airplane" mode.
Passengers can already do this for most of the flight, but many people find it difficult not to have access to their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering the decision that requires US carriers to perform significant work to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not have the immediate intention of changing their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it was reviewing the announcement but pointed out that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
“CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices by air,” she said.
The issue is regulated by aircraft operators to ensure that passengers maintain safety at all times and passengers are bound by safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who had already told CASA about her intention to extend the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said she would follow the regulator.
“We would welcome a revision of CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really believe that it would improve the customer experience now that we have (from the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft,” said a spokesperson.
Qantas said that it was currently complying with the current rules.
“In line with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not have an immediate intention to change that,” she said.
The FAA's decision applies to US airlines.
However, we are still interested in the regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA's decision and the reasons for it.
For US carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training equipment, hand luggage programmes and instructions provided to passengers.
“As soon as an airline has checked the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes,” said the FAA.
In the rare cases of low visibility, the crew will require passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely stowed under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
CDC publishes advice on child allergies for schools
On Wednesday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a series of guidelines on how to manage children's food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines that the US government publishes, as the number of school-age children with food allergies has risen sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States now suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children had increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness of food allergies in children's faculty and staff, and how to treat them in case of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine – the EpiPen auto-injector being the most commonly used – to react quickly to life-threatening anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently updated regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "I have the impression that something pricks my tongue", "I feel like I have a hair on my tongue" or "I have tingling on the tongue."
Much opposition to medical assistance in dying in Congress of palliative care
The Canadian Congress of Palliative Care, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the bill on medical assistance in dying in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reiterate their disagreement.
If all the sick had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few would like to end their lives, according to a spokeswoman for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If the focus was on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would become minimal.
The president of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical assistance in dying.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for future generations.
"What is the meaning of life", she laments.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice President of the Alliance of Palliative Care Houses, Suzanne Fitzback.
Mrs Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, believes that the service would in any case be useless.
We're never asked, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill disorients the population over the vocation of palliative care.
He does not believe that Ontario will follow suit.
For her part, the Liberal MP for Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, argues that the concept of the end of life will have to be clarified before the bill is adopted.
Halloween 2013: In figures
When I was a kid, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more pingre.
In the last two years, I have not distributed a single candy and I will certainly not do so any more this year.
But the stats show that I'm the black sheep when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – indeed, 158 million – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of 6.9 billion dollars on sweets, disguises, and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to every Halloween party are trends.
The costumes are expected to amount to EUR 1.2 billion out of the EUR 6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, sexy inanimate objects are all the rage.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods such as pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the television series The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk spacemen will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's no harm in staying traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my astonishment, they were not the only ones.
In fact, Americans are going to spend 330 million dollars on animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of curious dogs disguised as hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't mind.
The Americans are going to spend 1.9 billion dollars on sweets this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is a great news for the 41 million children who go hunting candy in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, let's not tell us any stories, consume 41 million kilograms of chocolate during Halloween.
Maize candy is the only thing you don't want to eat; and yet almost 16 million kilograms are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
That's about 9 billion corn grains.
It's a mystery that I haven't yet managed to elucidate.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terter Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, which generate about 500 million dollars in revenue, according to the America Haunts, and that includes these great photos of you pissing on you that your friends are putting on Facebook and you can't take away and on which a guy you like leaves a comment on the "told head." style.
Finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to La Grosse Pumpkin when we were kids, and carve a lantern-shaped pumpkin, it's like decorating a Christmas tree -- it's something we've been doing since we were very young.
Fortunately for us, the "master-master's pups" only started last year with Pinterest, so most of us sculpted these pumpkins and didn't have to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about 106 million dollars on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Pumpkin-lants that wilt gently on the porch in your house probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you're trying to get more noticeable, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpt their 922 kg pumpkin.
Transport of school: the complaint considered admissible
The Commission scolaire de la Région-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) has been demanding, since the beginning of the school year, a fee of 150 euros per pupil (up to a maximum of 300 euros per family) for pupils benefiting from school transport to two residences, a service that the organization offers when it is in a position to do so.
Prior to the changes to the last budget, no financial contributions were requested.
'There is a mediation service which is proposed by the committee and I was interested,' explains Mrs Lefèvre.
In her view, the CSRS had been invited to mediation and asked for additional time to reflect on it.
'It is always better to talk about it, to consult and to find solutions,' says Ms Lefèvre.
The Commission scolaire de la Région-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) did not wish to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation was part of the process in a complaint.
DRC: army attacks last rebel stronghold
The irreducible M23, a few hundred combatants, were entrenched at almost 2,000 metres above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two localities located approximately 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, fighting continues despite the night," a resident of Jomba, who was reached by phone around 12:30, and according to whom a girl was shot in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased somewhat", he added, "it seems that FARDC Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has repulsed the rebels a little".
According to the witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "passed the night" in Jomba before climbing the front for a "sweep operation".
He was heard very clearly behind him of crackling that were fed with small arms.
From Bunagana, the political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapon detonations.
According to a source at the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, fighting entered "a final phase", with FARDC having "ridden the residual M23 positions to dislodge them".
Since the resumption of clashes between the 23 March Movement (M23) and the army on Friday, Monusco has not been directly involved in the fighting, but it has provided government troops with decisive support in intelligence, observation and planning.
In the late afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, were heading towards the front line.
They were armed with Kalashnikov and rocket launchers.
Earlier, on the road to Bunagana, border post with Uganda, military personnel assisted civilian personnel were loading a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a blazing new FARDC truck, to take over another craft planted with M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila called on Wednesday evening the rebels to "demobilely demobilise" on pain or disarmed "by force", but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing since December without a result for the time being.
On the spot, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We have completed the talks, all that remains is the Ugandan mediation to arrange for the signing", said Roger Lumbala, Vice-Chairman of the M23 delegation, without this information being confirmed immediately on the government side.
M23 was born out of a mutiny in April 2012 by former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M23, which is refuting Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and its basement is full of coveted mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday, according to the United Nations, the movement back to the Democratic Republic of the Congo that had begun in the morning reversed at midday.
"This morning we crossed back to our fields, but the soldiers told us to retreat," Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including an infant on her back, told AFP.
One gets the impression that the gunshots are approaching the population.
In the early evening, dozens of people crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
Israeli army kills Hamas member in Gaza
Israeli tank fire on Thursday killed a Palestinian Hamas activist and seriously wounded another in the southern Gaza Strip, according to health service sources.
A Hamas source explained that fighting broke out in that area, as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli army merely referred to a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel described as a "terrorist" by the Jewish State, dug on the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as conflicts erupt between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, to bend them, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to chant peaceful slogans at a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace to come back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Worried about the future of her country, she traded her work clothes for a T-shirt with the words “we want safety” in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered in Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been reports of conflict between Government forces and Renamo almost every day, the worst clashes since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by Rhodesia ruled by whites and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not fall back into open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The stakes are high for the growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than EUR 50 billion of investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for tensions.
Renamo stated that the government was behind the recent clashes and that it launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on 17 October.
The assaults on the former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked Renamo's bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, and Renamo spokesman Fernando Mazanga, according to the Financial Times.
The government blamed Renamo for unleashed the conflicts, and accused him of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who wanted to use "all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government".
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both wish to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr. Mazanga stated that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
“We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness,” said Mr. Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to ease tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.
“There are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who keep arguing,” explained Joseph Hanlon, an open university lecturer and a specialist in Mozambique.
None of them knows how to negotiate well, and none of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt at a sick movement to obtain concessions and a treasure trove of war from the government.
The share of the votes cast by Renamo has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo, is expected to win more votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who should step down at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He does not want a multiparty democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency,” said Mr. Mazanga.
It is not known exactly what the Renamo's capacity is, but it has carried out disruptive flash attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway.
Most of the skids took place in Sofala province, which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export the coal.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railroad for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely timid when asked whether Renamo would repeat that threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” said Mr. Mazanga.
The instability has increased the Government's frustrations, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, many people also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
"People think that the leaders of the country's future are the government and the president, and that it is up to the latter to find solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protester, said that people only wanted stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want free access to the roads,” he added.
Pia: at least four injured in violent fight
The small municipality of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday evening.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a crowd of about thirty people according to the testimonies collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was turbulent on the Pia side where a brawl involving several people broke out on the side of the Post Office.
At least four minor injuries are reported.
Alerts, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Pastor charged with child pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who cares for young people in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia is accused of child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and at the office of the National Research Council where he works.
The Baptist church in Timberlay, where the pastor officiated, said he was deeply saddened by this news.
In a statement, church officials said that Mr. Hudgins resigned from his post.
The pastor was released under conditional release.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under the age of 18 and should not access the Internet.
He will appear in the provincial court in Halifax in December.
Coulson used the phone hack to check a pipe
Former News editor-in-chief Andy Coulson reportedly used "telephone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation" to try to confirm a bogus hose on a liaison involving then-acting interior minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC stated in the Old Bailey Court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his “pretty special adviser”.
It was reported to the court that the paper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack Pawlby's voice mailbox and "permanently plant in front of his door", but Coulson also called him and left him voicemails.
“The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man who stays in front of people's homes hoping to surprise them, he's the kind of man who likes to present the story to people to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He said that NotW used three ways to investigate the issues: telephone piracy, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, the monitoring, he cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Is he aware of the telephone piracy?
He says otherwise, but we say, "Of course it is."
Rumors about a affair involving Clarke were picked up first by NotW's editorial office when a source, experiencing sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said that she had been told, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles. ”
A tape, with pirated voice messages on his phone at least three times, was entered at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures of the private investigator's computer that concerned Miss Pawlby and her sister in a “Projects” file.
During the period when the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, added Mr. Edis.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw Miss Pawlby's least gestures.
In a vocal message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we're planning to publish tomorrow that I'd really like to talk to Charles about." ”
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he himself was dating the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to hacking the telephone.
Tasmanian health system rescue plan of 325 million euros
The federal government maintains that the EUR 325 million bailout for the scalloping health system is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the state government will not waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking “urgent measures” to end a crisis caused by the ageing population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
The funding, scheduled for four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmania's independent MP, Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state,” Plibersek said today.
The plan of 325 million euros includes a 31 million euro campaign for non-urgent surgical operations.
An additional 2,600 operations, particularly in the field of orthopaedic surgery and cataract, will help to catch up.
Funding is also provided for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved outpatient care, training of medical professionals, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the idea that, according to front-line clinicians, it is the best way to treat Tasmania’s health care system,” said Plibersek.
The minister said that the Tasmanian government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on the sectors in which it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the State provides the services in the most effective and efficient manner.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the 325 million dollars will not count for much "unless they are followed by a real reform to consolidate Tasmanian's public health system".
He, however, congratulated the Government for responding to the urgent request for urgent assistance it had before the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid plan will go a long way towards removing Tasmanian public health care from the blacklist,” said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the State Government, these additional non-emergency procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes that today’s announcement is a “maternal solution.”
"The reason we're here is that the state's Labour government has taken 430 million dollars from its health system," he said on ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that pulls out almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts 300 million dollars, and pretend it's a good day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms Plibersek to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
It walks in mud, jungle and crosses rivers to offer free medical assistance
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in villages in Cameroon
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost all their weekends seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to elect him "CNN Hero of the Year."
This person will receive a total of 250,000 dollars to continue his or her extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a bruise from which he was going to bear the sequelae of the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, getting any treatment he could receive.
“It’s not easy,” adds Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5 o'clock, rush to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only 1 doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians would not be able to pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of the country's health expenditure is carried out in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," explained Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they can't enjoy life.
After seeing his father and as many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of events.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers practiced more than 700 surgical procedures free of charge over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaoundé.
And he created a nonprofit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, that travels to rural areas on weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about 30 people, they pile up in vans after attaching medical equipment to the roof and crossing difficult terrain to the villages that are most in need of help.
Luck doesn't always follow them.
They had to push vehicles many times to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received as a hero: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best accommodation available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to party, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team began to receive hundreds of patients.
“We receive 500 people on every visit,” said Mr. Bwelle.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this mobile hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, a pair of glasses collected, or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgical procedures under local anaesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in a school, a town hall or a house; after the procedure, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery room to give way to the next person.
With the generator lighting, operating room and sterilization of equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's a greasing rhythm, but village musicians usually help the team stay motivated.
“They are hitting drums all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work,” explained Mr. Bwelle.
On Sundays, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, performed 700 surgical procedures free of charge over the past year, and it knows that their presence can make all the difference to those to whom they come to help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
“It will change my future and that of my family,” said the man.
In addition to supporting this itinerant hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at private medical offices around Yaoundé at night.
It is this second job, he explains, that finances 60% of its association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he's sleeping," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer with Dr. Bwelle's group.
He is still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to be able to run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions is an opportunity for learning on the ground that they do not have at home.
“We were able to participate in operations to help with skinning the blood or passing the instruments to Dr. Bwelle,” explained Ms. O'Malley.
It's not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you're a second-year medical student.
Student volunteers usually pay their travel to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, transportation and education are taken over by Dr. Bwelle.
"He's a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gave his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people was not about to die out.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Helping others to live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
“I am so happy when I do this work,” added Mr. Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieve pain are the reasons why I do this.

In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a day of training and testing in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Pierre Nora's Two Frances
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and situate Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheatres and classrooms?
Undoubtedly, but by emphasizing its weakness for cross-roads, Sciences-Po, Hautes Etudes.
Referee of the works of others in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the editor's hidden work and underground writing.
Heir to the armchair that Fontenelle occupies at the Académie française?
Of course, but in the knowledge that such a coronation cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, which has happened.
They willingly recognized in him a great awakener, animator and unifying work, but pointing out that he was reluctant to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Places of Memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The bad languages were able to see a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a quick glance and scholasticity, but incurably dilettante, latitude.
The two books published by Nora soon two years ago have already established that the one who passed to not write had written a lot and well.
The book here should do him justice forever.
Yet there is, once again, the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagrancy, jubilation jumped together from one subject to another.
But we soon understand that the disparate objects gathered in this book with such a beautiful title bring the dealer back to one and the same passion: that of discovering the constitutive node of the French identity.
Why these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: this is a preoccupation of the time.
A little bit, we have been collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the peremptory minds of our leaders at the time, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism obliges, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora is stalking is quite different.
He does not ask himself as an heir to an eternal franc; he refuses to define himself.
An analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he wanders in a forest of symbols, stopped at each step by a rebus-shaped object, tormented by irritating questions.
Whose company, which is born of the company itself: why, in a country so permanently within its borders, so formerly framed and solidly masoned, are these dramatic calls for unity?
They are so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, only to conjure the turmoil born of the discord of French history.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundy, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very old.
And the most emblematic is obviously the one that splits national history in half.
From the revolutionary earthquake, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the former, but failed to deny it; rather than wished to regain its sanctity and all the more eager for unity and indivisibility than it had cut off from the one who was the obvious and powerful incarnation.
And from there, a nation that is invincible binary, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution.
To make this singularity of French identity feel, nothing beats the four steps outside the Hexagon, so that Pierre Nora's American getade might well be the heart of his book.
For America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a bill of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But American cousins only better emphasize what is unique to us.
There, men who had left their Ancient Regime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, men cluttered with an Ancient Indigenous Regime, and all the more radical.
There is a consensual revolution when it has sowed the drama and the confits it.
There are still honored founding fathers, and here revolutionary ancestors whose role is struggling to make, and who have also been killed.
This is an institutional constancy, and here a cascade of constitutions, as well as mistakes to be made and tests to be repeated.
France that is leaving, the France that is coming
There was, however, a time when the French thought they could sew up the torn dress of their history, and overcome the curse of the number two.
At this Third Republic, a central moment and creator, Pierre Nora showed a great deal of interest and even tenderness: greeting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary divide, teaching schoolchildren everything that in the old France obscured modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity had only a time.
Here she is again in debate, shaken by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of industrial minorities, absorbed in the European area.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France that is leaving and the cautious sketch of France that is coming.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, which should reserve some surprises.
It is discovered that the chimney was a casing tree.
The man of multiple curiosities turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The lattice ride was standing in the centre of the centre.
And he who had deposited, more than half a century ago, a subject on the idea of nation, but had evaded the initiation exercise of the thesis, entrusted us, cum greed, that he would eventually do it.
Admittedly, in a less stiff, more fragmented and more subtle form.
But let us make no mistake, which is equally restrictive.
For more than the imposed figure of the university curriculum, this thesis tells the inner necessity of a life.
How biometrics will invade our lives
No more passwords typing to access your smartphone or pay for purchases?
American, French and Japanese researchers are predicting a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Director-General of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will make it possible to ascertain the identity of a person making transactions in such a transversal and transnational universe as the Internet.
The privacy organisations confirm this craze for biometrics, but are concerned about it.
In 2011 alone and in France, the National Commission for Informatics and Freedoms authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the shape of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens, etc.
"Everyone will soon be identified, anywhere and at any time," said Justin Brookman, Head of Consumer Privacy at the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, among some, and pessimism, among others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques, which will make it possible to provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data are fingerprints, hand contour and venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its constraints.
'For example, some people who work concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are illegible,' says Philippe Robin, technical director of identity field at Thales Communications and Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand presupposes a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
It is both security - you cannot pick up these data without their knowledge - and a drawback: the procedure sometimes has to be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been carried out for 20 years on other approaches, such as facial or iris recognition (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to the increase in sensor accuracy and the computing capacity of computers needed to analyse data, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has increased tenfold over the last five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, Director of Accenture's research and development laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and Holland have deployed automatic border crossings using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
'Today we're researching voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment,' says Sridhar Iyengar, Director of Safety Research at the Intel Labs.
A unique and falsifiable marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
'In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data,' confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Foresight at the CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers the judicial police a suitcase costing EUR 90 000 to analyse DNA samples at the scene of a crime and within one hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is the person who claims to be).
The identification concerned the issuance of identity papers: it is necessary to compare the biometric elements (prints, photo, iris) with the information that the State has on all citizens already registered.
This ensures that a person does not attempt to usurp someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC thus offers the recognition of VIPs at the entrance to a hotel or shop.
'We are picking up images from surveillance cameras and comparing them to photos of celebrities circulating freely on the Internet,' explains Dany Nassif, loaded with NEC France's business development for biometric identification solutions.
Another use is to take a picture of a quidam who is queuing up in a store, following his progress through facial recognition and calculating the waiting time.
The authentication initially concerned physical accesses (borders, protected premises, canteens, etc.) or logical accesses (opening of a computer).
More recently, presence control has been added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the buddy who points out for another," justifies Cyril Bataller, from Accenture.
However, increasingly, authentication will also concern transactions, in particular those carried out from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from certain ATMs by introducing their card and placing their hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the typing of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by the company Natural Security in partnership with banks and large retailers: when paying in stores with his bank card, the customer does not type in his code, but introduces his finger into a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is scheduled to last six months.
If successful, biometric readers could soon arrive in French traders.
Ways to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics appealing to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
'If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in checkout for 30 seconds less, it's appreciable,' explains the manager of a large area.
The second is to offer personalised services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognise your voice and offer you tailor-made options.
Finally, reassurance by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
'Failprints are stored on a first server; people's identities are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure housing, which locks up if you try to move it,' quotes Philippe Robin, from Thales.
But, in the absence of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
Privacy professionals continue to be concerned.
"The advances in facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance," predicts Andrew Patrick of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines is planning to charge passengers carrying hand luggage on its flights up to a maximum of EUR 100.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to 100 dollars for one piece of hand luggage and two dollars for a coffee or soda, although in her announcement on Wednesday, she indicated that passengers could take the unopened can with them when the plane was off the plane.
New cost of hand luggage is for bags stored in the upper compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will always be free of charge.
Frontier stated that it would charge 25 dollars if the charges were paid in advance and 100 dollars if the travellers paid only once at the boarding gate.
Frontier's spokesperson, Kate O'Malley, said that the 100 dollars were planned to encourage travellers to pay the fees in advance.
"We don't want to charge that price," she explained.
Airlines began charging for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges put as much as they could in hand luggage stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no room in those compartments.
These charges are a means of ensuring that passengers carry less things on board.
O'Malley said that these new fees will not really be used to raise money.
The aim is to make Frontier's most loyal customers understand that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find room in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
For example, a passenger queuing a Frontier boarding gate could carry a bag free of charge, while the next person in the tail might have to pay 100 dollars for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of the costs before arriving at the door.
Frontier's hand luggage charges will not be charged until the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often shy about the costs of luggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that the costs of handling luggage are high and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people on Wall Street see the addition of luggage charges as a sign that airlines charge enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
However, many of them did not receive luggage costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first cost of hand luggage three years ago, and the low-cost airline Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other airline imposing such charges is the Hungarian airline Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks the costs at a surcharge.
The Panel found, in a December 2011 report, that Spirit's hand luggage costs were worth EUR 50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently travelled on Spirit and wondered what he was going to find at the boarding gate when passengers discovered the unusual cost of hand luggage imposed by the airline.
“I had never seen such a smooth boarding procedure throughout my professional career,” he said.
I expected to see tooth squeaks and a fight burst at the door.
The aircraft was full, he added, "the passengers got on board at the speed of the flash."
Frontier also makes as a Spirit and applies a 2-dollar fee for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take soda or fruit juice can carry the unopened can with them, and those who take coffee can be squeezed for free.
It will always distribute water free of charge.
US Airways briefly attempted to charge for drinks in 2008 but returned back seven months later after the passengers complained and no other major airline had followed.
Frontier's decision to charge a charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy their tickets directly from the airline is its latest effort to encourage customers to visit its site.
Airlines pay to online travel vendors like Orbitz 10 to 25 for every ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of contacting an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began to offer only half a miles of loyalty to customers who were buying their tickets via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced the miles premiums by 25% on a trip.
For example, a Frontier trip of 1,000 miles purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly from the Frontier site.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in her hometown, Denver, but her business is back and she loses money.
Revenue fell by 9% and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results released on Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic attempted to reschedule Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
Scientists have just shed light on how the movements of a dog's tail are related to its mood.
Previous studies had revealed that happy dogs swirled their tails further to the right (from the dog's point of view), while the nervous dogs moved it further to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said, "Everyone knows that in humans, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved differently in stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions. ”
Here, we tried to see what happened in other species.
He added that, just as in humans, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to disordered queueden queuings of other dogs, researchers followed animals watching films featuring other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analysed their behaviour.
It will certainly not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: “We presented to dogs films containing other dogs – either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other factors of confusion – and we were able to track the tail movement and present it as going further to the left or right. ”
When the animals saw an unspoken dog moving its tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog wagging its tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail narrowly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog wagging its tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know from experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added, "If you meet other dogs several times and if you notice that, most of the time, the movement from their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to that experience. ”
The researchers indicate that the results could enable owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the University of Bristol School of Veterinary Sciences, said that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University discovered that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a cheerful dog.
And in another scientific study by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said, "Dogs went easier to a robotic dog when its tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what is in the Italian study. ”
He said that the differences might come from the fact that the dogs that participated in the various studies did not fully consider the animals of the films or the robots as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs might be useful, he explained.
“Although many of the evidence in different mammals indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it will surely not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Launch of an accessory shop for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google-branded connected glasses.
They can thus acquire an earpiece, a charger or a storage case.
This store, which is strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for 50 dollars.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a protective cover made of micro-fibres or an in-ear earphone.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model with correction glasses, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of pupils have a mother tongue other than French.
This was the reason for a year ago a consultation with parents, pupils, teachers and education staff to consider how to better integrate students who live between cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of "Living together in French".
Vision diversity has been walking around schools for a year to help students of all backgrounds discover common benchmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Big names of writers, artists, whether they come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
"So we're creating projects so that they identify with all of this," explains Vision Diversity president Kamar.
Michel Venne, from the Institut du Nouveau Monde, identified several challenges for the school board.
'On the transmission, for example, of what Quebec culture is, the sense of belonging, support for staff in the transformations we are experiencing, within the student clientele,' he enumerates.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board has set up a research centre that will give tools to teachers who also sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz of the University of Montreal will be the scientific director.
Preparing to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
"Different pedagogical strategies, that's the real need," she sums up.
Research will focus on inclusion from all angles: linguistic, school, social and cultural.
Obama ends listening to the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to end its wiretapping of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in its intelligence activities, a US official said on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to regain control of the NSA's eavesdropping after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that the intelligence agency has been mentioned in the surveillance of the IMF and the World Bank since the beginning of the scandal.
When asked about the matter, a US government official replied: "The US is not conducting electronic surveillance of the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington."
Speaking anonymously, the official did not state whether such monitoring had been put in place in the past.
Another official said that Barack Obama had ordered these practices to stop these practices in the past weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the instruction that ended the use of the U.S. headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved on Thursday a tightening of controls over government surveillance programmes, but authorized their prosecution.
The Commission introduced new restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and has imposed a five-year limit on the retention of such information.
European stock exchanges down at mid-session, except London
With the exception of London, the main European stock exchanges are falling on Friday mid-session, which is being shot by some disappointing new companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
Moreover, investors remain cautious because they believe that the US Federal Reserve could unravel its quantitative easing policy sooner than expected.
Conversely, after the announcement of 0.7% inflation for the euro area as a whole, the idea is spreading among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could relax its monetary policy.
Wall Street futures heralded a rise in US equities, after two consecutive retreats.
At the values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the largest decline in the CAC 40, which was led by the result warning of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, after also publishing declining results this morning and announcing the in-house creation of a bad bank with 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets.
For its part, Vodafone (up 2.4%) kept the lead in the EuroFirst300 hikes in response to press reports that AT-T was studying a possible takeover bid.
In the foreign exchange market, speculation about the evolution of the ECB’s monetary policy is well under way, as shown by John Hardy, a strategist at Saxo Bank.
The ECB’s single mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week’s meeting.
We anticipate a high potential to down the euro.
In this context, the euro continues to fall against the US currency and has reached a two-week low of 1.3517 in the sitting.
Conversely, the same conjectures support the eurozone bond market.
This judgement means that a law adopted in July in that State and largely calling into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
Classical singing for teenagers
Each time, it will be the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful in the previous season.
Through five sketches imagined and performed by artists from the region, vignettes with a high dose of humor, adolescents are allowed to tame classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Société d'art lyrique du Royaume will return with its Lyrical Destinations, a formula that now fills the Pulperie of Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving artists from the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the Apéro lyrique, the benefit concert held last August, with the help of the Marie-Eve Munger colorature soprano.
It was a profit-making activity, alongside the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization produce a financial balance sheet that is as gentle in the ears as an air of The Bat.
Without delivering precise figures, the chairman of the board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness of so many cultural institutions, the future is well, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
'Finance is afloat and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operetta, a step we will take in seven years,' commented the trustee.
"I would even say beyond that", added the director-general, Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
Congolese army chases M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units were going to hunt down M23 rebels as far as their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
M23 appears to be defeated after being driven out of the towns in the north-eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo that it had been in control of the insurgency since the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurgency.
"We will pursue M23 and assault it wherever it hides because they are criminals," Colonel Olivier Hamuli, a FARDC spokesman, told Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, claimed on RFI that these military setbacks would not alter his demands at the peace talks.
The latter, according to the Ugandan mediators, resumed on Wednesday between the Kinshasa government and M23.
Sights are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last locality in the hands of the insurgents to have fallen this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion was created in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the escape of the Government garrison and the passivity of the blue helmets of Monusco.
The fall of Goma led to the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of staff, to strengthen its mandate and form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC headquarters was redesigned and the army went on the offensive against M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of government troops is now unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to be coming to an end," Congolese business expert Jason Stearns predicts on his Congo Siasa blog.
That would be historic - it would be the first time that the Kinshasa government had managed to defeat a major insurgency.
And this would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group in Rwanda would be present in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda, which is vehemently denying it, of military support for M23, which was initially mutilated former Congolese military personnel.
British Foreign Minister William Hague has called on Rwandan President Paul Kagame to exercise restraint, a spokesman for the Foreign Office has announced.
Last week, Kigali raised the possibility of military reprisals following shells in Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the town to welcome the entrance of FARDC soldiers.
"We lived for a year with M23 and it seemed unimaginable to us to be liberated by the army one day," testified by a resident of this locality bordering Uganda.
"We lived in terror (of the M23), we are traumatized," added the man.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedentedly, that American espionage "had gone too far inappropriately"
John Kerry has signaled a recklessness of the United States' defensive attitude to its surveillance programs by admitting, unprecedentedly, that on several occasions espionage "had gone too far inappropriately".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had been governed by “autopile pilot” when a series of inflammatory revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA’s spy activities came about.
The leaks put the US government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an Intergovernmental Conference in London via video link, Mr. Kerry said, “It is undeniable that the President, I and other members of the government have seen certain things in autopilot mode because we had the opportunity, from the Second World War until the difficult years of the Cold War, and of course 11 September. ”
He then became the first high-ranking member of the United States Government to admit that American espionage had crossed the line, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately. ”
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make it clear to people that he is now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be victims of abuse in this process.
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for the good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added, "We live in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up. ”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they acted?
We did prevent planes from falling, buildings to explode and people from being murdered because we were able to see the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged US espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the US, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had made about a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations because of the frustration of the National Security Agency's surveillance.
“It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain with us in the mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism,” said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and chairman of the US Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
And I am going to travel to Europe to make it clear to them that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has undermined relations with some US allies, but the agency's director said this week that this was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the US.
Other revelations have documented by Snowden that the NSA has intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and 34 other heads of state.
The director of intelligence, James Clapper, justified the espionage of the allies by stating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this atmosphere of turmoil, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a congressional trip, which should take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and two chambers.
The names of the other participating legislators should be unveiled in the coming days.
He indicated that the itinerary had yet to be determined.
Murphy stated that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, but also to demonstrate "affectionate firmness".
He explained that European Heads of State must be honest with their citizens about the kind of espionage programmes they have been implementing for years.
“We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world to do espionage,” said Murphy.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry planned to travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to manage the resentment generated by US strategies in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
The appeal of Scott Brown dismissed
Celtic Glasgow captain Scott Brown has been rejected and will be suspended for the next two Champions League matches against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expelled against Barça for a coup to Neymar, the Scottish milieu saw its suspension extended to three times by UEFA.
In a statement, his club said it was "very disappointed", considering that his appeal was fully justified.
For Titan CEO, "Goodyear Amiens's buying project starts with zero employees"
After throwing the sponge in a crash in January for the partial takeover of the Goodyear site in North America promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American Peumatic Titan, is now ready to save 333 of the 1,137 jobs in the factory.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister for Productive Recovery, had already announced on Monday 21 October.
After giving up the plan to buy the factory in January, you come back today.
You had pronounced violent attacks and insults, speaking of 'so-called workers', who are 'working three hours' a day, of 'crazy' trade unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this about-face.
Is it to please Mr. Monteburg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, is a charming young man who tries to save some of the highest paid industrial jobs.
If I hurt someone with my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of taxation and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries work eight hours of disability France.
In India, China and many other countries work 10 to 12 hours a day.
But I have no prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has space to grow.
Why does Titan so much need this factory?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But, with a fair price and skilled workers, it is worth trying.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the factory, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance pay, I think 100% of employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan is buying the closed factory from Goodyear.
As a result, Titan could move the machines to Poland or to any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Monteburg knows that.
However, he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agreed to recruit them from some 1,200 Goodyear employees.
Also Mr. Did Monteburg need a Titan's commitment before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear?
The first step is that CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on severance payments for all employees.
As a result, there will be no employees in the factory.
Mr. Monteburg said you were willing to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he would like a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance pay.
If all employees accept them, the project to purchase the plant starts with zero employees.
How can we give guarantees of working time when there are no employees left on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg manages that the CGT and Goodyear will agree and that Titan buys the factory, and we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after shooting
A shooting incident took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to the local police, at least two were injured.
He would be an employee working for the United States Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the gunbody.
The incident reportedly occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff rushed to the exits or on the tarmac.
Very quickly, the police intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport car park.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
Supreme Court validates Obama’s Health System Reform Act
Great victory for the Obama administration: The US Supreme Court today declared that Obama’s ratified health-care reform law is constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to take out health insurance by 2014, on pain of having to pay a fine – and declared it constitutional under the government’s taxing power.
Supreme Court President John Roberts joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the Law of 2,700 pages and also considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulated that the threshold of eligibility for Medicaid should be lowered, on pain of losing all federal funding for the programme, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure to block the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All the top Republican presidential candidates competing in the 2012 primaries, including the nominee Mitt Romney, fiercely opposed the law.
Aretha Franklin will return to the stage in December
The newspaper Detroit News reports that the Queen of Soul will perform on December 21 at the Sound Board Room at the MotorCity Casino Hotel.
Ms. Franklin was booked in November with an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease from which she suffered, the famous Respect interpreter had told the media on 16 October that the side effects of a treatment she received were "difficult".
She claims to be "happy to be back".
Children's myths and legends should be taught as "lifestyle models", says the author.
The Legend of Thor could show that "brush force does not weigh up to subtle trickery", while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "yoon too violent, far too scandalous, and in some cases far too obscene to be taught at school," Crossley-Holland advocated a "quite selection" of age-appropriate works.
“I find it great that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been in favour of this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers were “overtly didactic” meant that children “reached completely”, with messages being “sublimated” in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Anglo-Saxon's Beowulf and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said, "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight. ”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or ended well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it has to be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than a declared one.
The known basis of what is shown and not said.
United States green light at the Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday that they had not received any objections from the US authorities to their merger, moving closer to the creation of the world's leading advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second largest agency in the world, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Groupe announced today the deadline for reviewing the previously announced merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, as amended by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," the two groups announced in a statement.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorisations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Africa.
The expiry of the review period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorization decisions issued in the other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the completion of the operation.
'The merger is also conditional on obtaining other regulatory authorisations and approving shareholders in both groups,' they add.
New application for a collective action against the St. Croix brothers
A new application for a class action was filed against the St. Croix brothers, concerning sexual assaults allegedly taken this time at the St. Joseph Oratory and in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The complaint is based on the complainant's testimony, identified as "J. J.", who would have been masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his professor the Surfied brother, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the oratory of Saint Joseph, where he was serving as a mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was only for three establishments, and when the Rules were announced, many people told us: 'I was in this place, can I register?' says the lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The fact that has just been brought is a particular feature of the fact that it allows for the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse may have been committed by members of the Sainte-Croix congregation.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 persons who claim to have been assaulted by the St. Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the establishments concerned closed in the 1960s.
The appeal also points out that the Congregation of St. Croix and the oratory of St. Joseph, which is a separate entity, "allowed sexual abuse of children", that they "exercise moral, religious and psychological coercion against the victims", that they "be informed of the sexual abuse perpetrated and nevertheless stifled them", and that they "have knowingly and consciously chose the problem".
These latest accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of the Sainte-Croix brothers, Mr. Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research made in the archives on this subject by brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuse.
The class action must first pass the stage of admissibility in the Superior Court.
Once the admissibility is admitted by the Court, the second stage is carried out, namely the hearings on the merits.
In the case of the first appeal, the Congregation of St. Croix had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were conducted on the merits.
DRC: Army prepares for further assault
Children are playing on a charred armoured belonging to the M23 rebels in Kibumba on 31 October 2013 in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The Congolese army was preparing on Friday for another assault on the last strongholds of the M23 rebels near Bunagana in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The aim is to dislodge the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday we took Bugina hill, which overlooks Mbuzi's hill.
Today, Mbuzi should fall by itself.
All that remains is Runyonyi's hill.
"Coule de Chanzu is not very strategic", North Kivu Governor Julien Paluku told AFP.
Mr. Paluku plans to travel to Bunagana on Saturday.
As the political leader and last stronghold of the rebellion, this town is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was taken over on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreducible M23s have been entrenched at an altitude of almost 2,000 metres on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who reported close fighting on Thursday throughout the day said that the situation had been "quiet since this morning".
According to him, a woman and his child were killed by the fighting of the day before and were buried.
One girl was shot and wounded, and three others were injured, including a serious one, evacuated by FARDC, added the witness, quoted by AFP.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have not seen any loss of life.
Court blocks decision on NYPD control and search policy
A federal court of appeal blocked a judge's decision on Thursday demanding changes to the New York Police Department's control and search program and de-trials.
The United States Court of Appeal (Second Circuit) stated that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the end of the city's appeal.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to monitor and interrogate citizens.
The city appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a monitor to assist the police department in changing its policy and the associated training programme.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments on Tuesday for the request for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be removed from the case because she breached the judges'code of conduct by jeopardizing the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly reacted to court critics.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black men and men of Hispanic origin as part of their monitoring and search programme.
It designated an outdoor controller to oversee changes, including policy, training and oversight reform, and ordered the establishment of a pilot programme to test body-mounted cameras in neighbourhoods with the largest number of controls.
In August, the City of New York agreed to terminate the practice of keeping the names and addresses of persons whose cases are rejected after police screening.
The hearing of the city's appeal is scheduled to take place after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of monitoring and searching have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This system of monitoring and search has existed for decades in some form, but the number of checks recorded increased dramatically under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 controls that mainly concerned black men and Hispanic origin.
Judicial action was brought in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and became collective action.
Supporters advocating changes in the NYPD’s monitoring and search program say they will end unfair practices, allow for more effective and trusted police forces, and be able to change the way police departments use politics.
Opponents say that these changes would undermine police morale without reducing crime, would be a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after the number of police officers had been drastically reduced over the last decade.
The judge stressed that it did not stop the constitutional monitoring and search practices, but that it was reforming the way the NYPD was implementing its controls.
NSA revelations increase corporate paranoia with regard to state surveillance
On a fine day in late August, a German police helicopter flew over the British Consulate of Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital, at low altitude.
On the orders of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the US outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explained that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation had sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of U.S. intelligence, insisted again in September that the US is not using its foreign intelligence capabilities to "steal the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits."
But since Edward Snowden, the whistleblower consultant, has begun unveiling his inexhaustible treasure trove of information about US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders no longer know if the director should be taken to parole.
Reports that the US National Security Agency has spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and has had access to data held by US cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever given rise to corporate paranoia for state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the last straw that drove the vase overwhelmed.
If Europe's most powerful person can be targeted, then business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Snowden made the intensive collaboration between US intelligence and businesses transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data should be used for their mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” says Oliver Granon, President of BITMi, who represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the US poses as much as China’s risk of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consulting firm EY.
However, in all the documents unveiled by Mr. Snowden, there is no evidence to date that the United States has passed on industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are sceptical about this.
A member of the German parliament says that we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them...
“This is not the right way to do it,” says Hasso Plattner, president of the German enterprise software company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then it should not be allowed to die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal to cars to farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
Yet the scale and sophistication of US spy agencies exposed by Snowden’s revelations have been a shock to some companies that previously believed that China was the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials have become aware that data stored in the US are regulated under the laws of that jurisdiction and thus potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional body, some 10% of non-US members have given up plans to use a US cloud storage service provider after revelations about the US Prism data mining program.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, said, "Our customers are asking us today a question that they didn't ask us a year ago: where is my data kept and can you assure me that it will remain physically in this jurisdiction?" "
Many German leaders point out that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that the powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that these data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There have always been.
“This has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion,” said Kurt Bock, Managing Director of the chemicals-producing company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially, just as we spy on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, should that leave the advantage to an adversary.
Large companies have long hammered the message that it is not imprudent to retrieve a free USB stick at a business lounge or to leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of the car manufacturer Audi, said that the collection of mobile phones before board meetings, so that they could not be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
The German BfV advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad because of the risk of undermining the integrity of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
“SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV warns in a report.
The United States alerts its own companies to economic espionage activities by other countries.
The US-made National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) quoted France, as well as Russia and Israel, second-degree guilty of hacking economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former French domestic intelligence director, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies. ”
A tax on foreign homeowners to break the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally quantified the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision by Mr. Osborne, which in the 2012 budget, has entered a stamp duty of 7% for properties costing more than EUR 2 million and annual fees for buyers who choose to own properties in a company rather than as an individual.
The stamp duty already applies to residential properties in the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea districts, and represents EUR 708 million in the 2012/13 fiscal year, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, North-West and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook said: “Following the increase in stamp duty on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidement law, it is very difficult to argue that high-value properties are under-imposed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system. ”
“But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell,” he added.
Prestigious real estate – the top 5-10% of the real estate market prices – in the thriving sector southwest of London stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8% over the past year.
Prices in central London show steady year-to-year growth of 5.6% after year but were overshadowed by a growing “internal market”, south-west of the city, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) recovering, according to Savills studies.
US shutdown slows down the rise in the car market
The 16-day closure of most federal administrations affected the growth in car sales in the United States in October, according to figures released on Friday by manufacturers, with five of the top six performing below expectations.
The three major manufacturers in Detroit are showing double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts expected an average of 15.4 million annualized and seasonally adjusted sales, but the market was estimated at 15.3 million by Adam Jonas, an analyst of Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank's customers, he considers that this slight brake is explained in the first place by 'the government's 'shutdown' and its impact on consumer sentiment in the first half of the month".
However, GM reported an increase of almost 16% in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, compared to 211,563 expected by consensus.
The group's four brands saw their commercial performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit from the success of its pick-up trucks, saw its sales increase by 14% year-on-year to 191,985 vehicles, while consensus awaited 194,301.
For its part, Fiat-controlled Chrysler announced an 11% increase in sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared to 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also out of consensus sales, despite year-on-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
On the New York Stock Exchange, GM was growing 1.4% at 4:35 p.m. GMT while Ford sold 1.1%.

A study to multiply the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland was launched by the UK Government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services up to Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as the Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "bring the UK together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" about working with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will cover a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government increased the estimated cost of constructing the high-speed link between London and the north of England, from EUR 32.7 billion to EUR 42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of rail capacity and improving journey times for the north of England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travel times between Glasgow and Edinburgh up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together. ”
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits it has are enormous.
Without it, we are faced with a problem of capacity in our rail network.
But it is also a question of developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland. ”
For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called Mr. Carmichael to "unemisely" support for Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer Scotland considerable economic benefits, but it also brings Scotland's economic weight in the overall high-speed rail project throughout Britain.
“We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the UK Government to discuss options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edenburg-Glasgow line that the Scottish Government is already planning.
"I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and we will decide together on the next steps. ”
UN welcomes new goals for poverty reduction
The United Nations will begin working now on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were put in place 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in highlighting the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, ahead of the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development that began the day before in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it is now time to “extend national interests.”
“I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and take ownership of the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (SDGs),” he added.
These SDGs will build on progress in the Millennium Development Goals and become an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Parents of intersex children may choose “undetermined sex”
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female sex of newborns will no longer be rigidly assigned to them at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their child, allowing them to register an “indeterminate” or “unspecified” sex on his or her birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions about sexual reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person said years later, "I'm not a man or a woman. ”
I'll keep the patchwork that the doctors created, bruised and swept.
It is estimated that one in every 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, as intersexuality is part of the age group of 60 diseases diagnosed as disorders of sexual development, a generic term for people with chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testes) atypical or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to attribute it, then wait and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical act, if necessary.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York City and a specialist in sexual identification issues, said that the new German law "would seem like a good idea".
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
“Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but most children do not,” he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assault without surgery, and see how identity develops.
The science of how a child develops a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transgender or transgender people, since their status is not gender-related but rather their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other.
These characteristics may manifest themselves in secondary sexual traits (such as muscle mass, hair, breast and stature), primary sexual characteristics (such as reproductive and sexual organs) or chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and prejudice-motivated crimes.
Non-conforming young boys now have special camps for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or “third sex” on their official records.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian woman, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as "neutral" after winning her appeal, which allowed her to retain an "unspecified" sex for life.
German passports will include a third designation alongside M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators in this land-based Catholic country signed a petition for "gender theory" to be removed from textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also opposed German law, writing that "since the world is dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are reversed. ”
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also stated on Baby Area that she would prefer a sex to be attributed to babies at birth.
“The parenting role is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s sex,” she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, after the name of the beautiful Greek god who had a double sex.
And just a decade ago, the medical community considered the genre to be a slate, which can be erased and redesigned.
But now many people question the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will experience sexual reassignment as he or she grows up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency,” said Drescher.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, they would call the surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was initiated by Dr. Johns-Hopkins University, who considered gender to be malleable.
He enshrined the term “sexual identity” and argued that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with a child’s genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/Joan," his theories were controversial.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut during a botched circumcision to have him castrated completely, also removing his testicles, and raising him as a girl.
"Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it wasn't," said Drescher.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors "always repeat this model".
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived these sex-changing operations said, “They are not satisfied with the result.”
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors could not really say whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent surgical removal of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
He was made to take female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he underwent vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical file.
What he discovered horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (SDD) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, following a testosterone treatment and had his breasts removed.
Surgery made him sterile.
Today, he champions the cause of others in an organization called the Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, the general manager of the California-based nonprofit Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law “invites labelling and stigmatization.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an 'indeterminate' sex," she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we haven't seen what the law is going to give, so we can only put forward hypotheses.
Tamar-Mattis stated that her organization supported Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized as third sex".
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal genre,” she added.
German law concerns the attribution of sex at birth.
It is not a battle that young children should wage at that age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr Arlene Baratz, a mammography radiologist in Pittsburgh, whose daughter has a sexual development disorder and helps thousands of people in a support group, has said that German law will "empower" parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called androgen-insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of her androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
It has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29 years old, Katie is married and in-house in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although it was infertile, it hoped to have children through adoption services or surrogate mothers.
“The law leaves parents some leeway to make hasty decisions,” said Baratz.
This gives them time to do some tests and understand them, and a time before you write "male" or "female".
So, everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You do not have to rush for surgery that is irreversible.
“This puts children at the heart of the decision and attenuates the sense of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do the right thing,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he/she feels the most comfortable – and that’s something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
An octogenarian takes care of children with a rifle at Muy for Halloween
The minors aged 9 and 13 were door-to-door to claim candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the Muy district visited by the children opened the door while holding his hunting rifle.
The 86-year-old man explained to the gendarmes that he had been afraid.
His weapon was seized.
The cry of despair of Obama's voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of change
He says Obama made laudable efforts foiled by Republican Party obstructionism
Obstructionism does not excuse Obamacare’s difficulties, or drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign memo reminder is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a frightfully sad book these days.
It's a book that I thought would encourage me during the gloomy second year of medicine and give me hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win," and it's the memoirs of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished my patients' medical reports in the evening and went to bed, this book takes me back to the days when politicians were inspiring millions of people and speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended with a landslide victory, and news anchors took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades cried with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries was moving towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama’s transition period before he took office in 2008, he had 82 percent of opinion.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like coming out of a dream.
It's hard to remember these days full of optimism, they're like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure from Iraq of our army, through the end of the “no seeing or known” and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to move our nation forward in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending Obama’s administration in the face of my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide any explanation.
I am on the brink of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the tapping of foreign leaders, or attacks on innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on American privacy, nor the indictment of whistleblowers who reveal the government’s misdeeds.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial or the evasion of public funding and the overshooting of authorized expenses during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the findings of a report that says that the White House's efforts to silence the media are the "most aggressive...since the Nixon administration".
And, more recently, she cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at the age of 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that precede it.
Of course, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and the events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that did not seem to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, who was elected for a second term while freed from pressure from future elections, would keep the promises that had been heard about for so long.
Yet, while the index of favourable opinions plunged into 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
He makes me want the many promises that have gone away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses to Clinton at the Pennsylvania Primary.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and stay true to their cause.
“I want us to refocus on our talent,” he said.
We must remember who we are.
We are five years old, Mr President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
The New Star managed a comeback on the audience side, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6% audience share.
But was the show there?
Some 10,000 candidates took to the auditions of the 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the villain Sinclair, the perché André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really scored in this first premium.
As every year, early audition shows brewing a wide choice of aspiring singers, for better and sometimes for the worse.
Now, on Twitter, we want entertainment, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, a few have benefited.
Many of them tried the New Star, and sometimes even went all the way.
Behind the television screens, the vocations of successful singer are still there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make people laugh.
RBS suspends two traders in the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division by two sources close to the case, which shows once again that the global regulator's investigation into suspicions of manipulation of the currency market is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in investigations of the world’s largest financial market, where USD 5.3 trillion changes hands every day.
The two traders were the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the expansion of the investigation, which echoed the Libor interbank rate manipulation scandal.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
“The ongoing investigation into this case is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the case stated that RBS had transmitted email and instant messages, sent to and by a former trader, to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as European head of spot trading for currencies at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Citi's European head of spot exchange trading, was released on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, a senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders has been charged.
Mr. Usher included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, added sources close to the case.
UBS explained this week that it filed an action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said it was investigating suspicions of foreign-market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
Worldwide, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are investigating allegations of bankers who are said to have agreed to manipulate foreign-exchange-market rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources close to the case have indicated.
Banks are sploading instant messages and emails that have been sent for years to find cases of wrongdoing.
News about these investigations has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest growth drivers of investment bank trading units in recent years, but has been challenged this year due to low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the large, highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
One senior trader said that despite the high volume of day-to-day foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading management platforms and the increasing use by banks of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to begin to have an impact on the market at low cost".
The news came the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had returned a trader working in its office of the funds traded to the London Stock Exchange this week after it had caused a loss of EUR 6 million at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
“We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was brought under control,” said a representative of Crédit Suisse.
A Chinese newspaper that has launched a call “will be reworked”
A Chinese newspaper that has launched a front-page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be reshuffled, says a press regulator.
The Guangzhou-based New Express has issued a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to make stories about a semi-public company.
The New Express will now undergo a “complete overhaul,” the regulator said.
The order of “revision” emanates from Guangdon's administration for the Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles about the listed company between September 2012 and August 2013.
“New Express was disorganized,” the regulator said in a statement.
He stated that he had decided “to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card”.
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete reshuffle of New Express, and recommended that he investigate the persons responsible at New Express and immediately reshape the newspaper's management team".
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express about the alleged financial irregularities of a manufacturer of construction sites called the company.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice issued a front-page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to having published fake stories for money.
“In this case, I have harmed the media industry and the media industry and its ability to win public confidence,” he told the public TV network CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was running after money and celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following the apologies of Mr. Chen, New Express posted his front-page apology, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several major suspects have recently made television confessions.
Experts say that people are systematically forced to confess, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier in the year prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
Obama backtracks on health-care reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama yesterday retracted his unambiguous and often-repeated promise that “if you are satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of people received notices of termination from their service providers, Republicans have criticized the president over the past few days, accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
“The vast majority of people with health insurance that suits them can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls “an effervescence in the news” about terminations, President Obama incited Americans who received these notices to seek new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to get comprehensive and better-adapted health plans for the same price, or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll win," he said.
The Administration announced that it is not surprising that the 5 per cent of the population who enters into insurance themselves are forced to change plan because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me address these Americans directly: you deserve better,” Kathleen Sebelius testified to the Washington Energy and Trade Commission.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the October launch of the online market has failed to “lamentably”.
"I'm as frustrated and irritated as anyone else," she added.
I look forward to regaining your confidence.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this sentence, as she believed her microcut, addressing an assistant sitting behind her at yesterday's Assembly session following an exchange of contentious views with Billy Long, the Missouri Republican representative, to find out if she should join Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long repeatedly asked Ms. Sebelius why "the architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to take out a plan via HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
Tribute to folk by the Coen brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" of the Coen Brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the 1961 Greenwich village and the folk music that was just beginning to resonate there, before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the Cinémathèque française, had rounded up the Palme d'Or in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Failing to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have set their sights on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the planetary pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and songs performed live, Oscar Isaac proves to be an accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, quits pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich bears in "Gatsby the Magnificent" for less glowing clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the oath cut to the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells the story of a week's tribulations of a folk singer who can't break through and gets angry with the entire earth.
He accepts backwards the replacements at the foot raised in the studios.
Without accommodation, he toured the sofas of his friends who would still receive him.
A documentary tune
"His relationship with success is tortured, that is what we were interested in: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not a career but integrates, with self-destructive behaviour," Ethan Coen told the press, crowned with his brother Joel with several Oscars and prizes in Cannes.
While Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two filmmakers fan folk music built their story on real personalities of the time such as folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this neighborhood in New York City called to become "the epicentre of the rise of folk music that would spawn international stars" as Van Ronk's journalist Elijah Wald writes.
The film then takes on the appearance of a documentary, from the unsold albumed music label of 33T inhabited by an old unpayable secretary, with the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where the singers performed.
The magic of the Coen brothers continues to be done by incorporating a funny character who passes through the film all the time: a beautiful red cat with a crispy gaze, a fortune-time companion by Llewyn Davis.
Asked how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled "greater in Tennessee, bathed by blues and country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play the guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is needed to "be considered good", "chance can also launch someone's career", and "more and more today".
Like Llewyn Davis, who refuses to compromise on her music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to be stuck by anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves".
Chevron, the US second-largest oil company, reported on Friday a decline in its quarterly profit due to declining refining margins, while its oil and gas production has risen while remaining behind the group’s targets.
Its net profit for the third quarter decreased to USD 4.95 billion, or USD 2.57 billion, from USD 5.25 billion, or USD 2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters expected on average a profit per share of .71 dollars.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd produced a year earlier.
The company is targeting 2.65 million bpd for this year, with 25% output growth expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
As a result of the cost of these projects, annual capital expenditure has increased by .07 billion dollars over two years and is expected to reach .36.7 billion dollars in 2013.
Profits from production activities declined slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell by 45 per cent to USD 380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the whole sector.
For example, Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil reported a declining net profit on Thursday, despite its increase in gas and oil production.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the United States Transportation Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of gunfire.
Firefighters called to the scene of the tragedy claimed to have responded to a call for "multiple injuries".
"The law enforcement is there," the airport says on its Twitter account, while the television images showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting," a spokesman for the US Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) told AFP.
The local ABC antenna showed one person evacuated on a stretcher, and a second port on a wheelchair.
The incident took place at around 9.30 a.m. local time (12.30 p.m. in Montreal) at Terminal 3 of the airport, the airport also specified.
The Los Angeles Times states that teminaux 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesperson was unable to confirm immediately whether one of his employees was injured.
All flights arriving at and departing from the airport have been suspended.
NSA spying: US is "going too far", admits Kerry
The US has sometimes gone "too far" when it comes to espionage, said Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first admission of Washington in the midst of controversy with Europe on the massive data collection by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the US and its European allies, this is the first time that a US government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in the NSA interception of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I admit it to you, as the President did, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this does not happen in the future," Kerry said at a conference in London in which he had been participating since Washington on Thursday 31 October via video link.
In his retransmitted statement, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of US diplomacy had at length justified the practices of intelligence and information gathering by the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and those in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the United States authorities had since thwarted numerous plans of attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have actually prevented planes from falling, only buildings exploding and people being murdered, because we were able to be aware of these projects," the head of US diplomacy argued.
And, said John Kerry to Europeans, 'I can assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived.'
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far inappropriately," the Secretary of State, who had already had to speak about this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured on Thursday night that President Obama was "solved to try to clarify and that he is re-icing these practices so that no one feels wrong".
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which quotes documents from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, claims that the program dubbed 'MUSCULAR', and conducted with the British NSA counterpart, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to retrieve data from the fibre-optics used by Internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items were collected in January alone - ranging from metadata on e-mails, text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection to these practices.
Over the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain, and Italy have revealed that the NSA has massively intercepted data and communications from allies of the United States and its leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and leaks in the American press claimed that the US president was unaware of such eavesdropping, Barack Obama refused to speak out about it, citing national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied him that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even sent the ball back to the European intelligence services that allegedly seized the communications, before providing them to the NSA.
This would concern 'military operations' in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and this would not be aimed at Europe at all, said General Alexander.
And the controversy was on Friday in Asia.
Indonesia convened the Ambassador of Australia, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international espionage network that has also aroused China's ire.
Early puberty: Ageing earlier
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent.
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced among boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother worry if her daughter's breasts and pubic hair start growing at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a polo denologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young American women and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – in general, this does not indicate a rapid shift towards full puberty,” said Kaplowitz.
Clear signs of development, such as budding of the breasts, hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odours, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of the early rule over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half, when it was 12, three-quarters in 1970.
“Once the chest has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear,” said Kaplowitz, also the author of “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.”
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered "early" when the development of the breast is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows or stops – this is something that a pediatrician can follow closely.
Faster evolution may justify tests performed by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of early menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature bone ageing that can slow growth and small size in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on child age, developmental rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with drugs but acknowledges that "controlling puberty can alleviate some of the behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others."
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their rules.
“They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way they manage hygiene issues,” said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had her first period at 10.
Even though there were signs and we talked about the rules, it wasn't emotionally prepared.
She returned from the school frightened and upset to be the first among her friends.
There are many theories brought to the attention of the public on the causes of early puberty.
Yet there is no consistent theory that hormones in milk or other foods, environmentally friendly chemicals, or media-sponsored sexual messages are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach their puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the most credible hypothesis is the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study of girls aged 6 to 9 years that links the percentage of fat to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influencing factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic to climate to genes.
Another problem is that while boys have hair on their faces and in the younger pubic area, the trend towards true early puberty is not as pronounced as among girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference stressed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child-endocrinomist working at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will generally react well.
Girls with early puberty must be reassured that, even when it comes sooner than expected, the process is part of life.
A driver travelling at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was given an kernel of EUR 1 000
A motorist was fined 1,000 dollars for driving at 210 km/h with a warm drink in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted leading his Mercedes Benz to the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to be carried between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the conduct of conduct without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points removed from his permit resulted in a 6-month withdrawal of permits.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of 90 dollars and a surcharge for victims of 100 dollars.
Former hostage in Lebanon: "Return is quite complex to manage"
Abducted in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his "Antenne 2" team filming a Hizbullah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the Association for the Defence of Hostages "Osses du monde", which he has chaired for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the possibility for hostages to lodge a complaint and bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
Detained more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Military Hospital of Val-de-Grâce on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to reunite their families.
And try, little by little, to resume their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" asked Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, former chief reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Otages du monde".
From the evening of your release, you were on the 8th stage of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
In particular, in Beirut, in Beirut.
When I'm released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet -- without seeing it because it's dark -- Roger Auque.
He tells me 'we are released', but I am not sure, and tells me that we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but we're very tense, too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They put us down on the edge of a pavement.
There are Syrian soldiers.
It then arrives at the Summerland Hotel, where the press is present.
French people take us to the French embassy.
It is the time of the first phone calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And dining in a T-shirt at the French embassy.
I also remember a short night talking to Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we do not have the means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arriving there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua is taking board.
How did your arrival on French soil take place?
We land in Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible thirst.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three television channels.
I'm coming back and there's plenty of them.
The descent of the airplane stairs, the reunion with my son and my relatives, my friends, all this is extremely emotional.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The motorcyclists pull themselves out of the flock to take pictures and follow me to my home where I have to do a little bit of the police to prevent some from getting up.
The media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We're coming out of a hole and we're suddenly in the media.
It's a little complicated, a little bit violent, it's pretty complex to deal with.
But we did the hardest thing.
That evening, I'm at 8 p.m., the next day I'm on TV.
Then begins a kind of rehabilitation to life, very slowly, for a month or two that is a bit like a holiday.
How did medical examinations and DGSE debriefing take place?
I had a first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Grâce the following days my return: radios, examinations of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a meeting that does everything, but we know that we can count on him, to remind him if necessary, that we are not left to our own devices.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met the intelligence services.
They asked me about the hostage-takers.
That was logical.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages in Niger?
I'm listening to what's being said.
The debate on ransoms in particular.
Some things annoy me, some things are less.
I am trying to distinguish between the questions about my past as a hostage and my chair of the 'Osses du monde' association, which allows me to distance myself, and seems to me much more interesting to address.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, along with others, for the recognition of the legal status of hostage.
In my opinion, there is a problem of semantics.
We must call hostage-taking hostages "political" - which is the case most of the time - and allow the hostages to have access to justice, to lodge a complaint and bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is compassionate, emotional, and rejoices in the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is made for that.
Why should we not say to the hostage-takers "you have flouted the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva Conventions, we will bring you to court"?
It seems to me, however, justified, legitimate, common-minded.
This message is heard, but not listened to, and I am shocked.
This is my main fight.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard took place on Saturday, November 2 at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump association, the competition is expected to bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registration is taken on the spot on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and qualification phases will begin immediately at 10 a.m. before the scheduled final at 3 p.m. and the award ceremony at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend competitions at the highest level, like the young hyeri prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years old, he has already won his place this year for the European Championships in Copenhagen and he likes nothing as long as he goes back to competitors who exceed it by three heads.
The Wolf of Wall Street: release of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese escapes some images from his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget about being reasonable and take your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will unhook you off the side of his role as a crazy trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "Long Island Stock Exchange Broker, who refuses to work with the authorities in a major corruption case on Wall Street".
In the '80s, Jordan Belfort set up a scam that will make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
Without limits, the man goes on to parties, women, drugs.
Decadence and excesses of all kinds are the key words of this crazy story.
The couple Scorsese-DiCaprio seem to have regained the magic that had united them on Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its too long mounting.
It seems that the film finally lasts 2 hours and 45 minutes.
In theaters on 25 December, he will be able to participate in the Oscar race.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, which was overwhelmed by Shell’s poor performance and the day after the Fed announced that it would maintain its support for the economy, as expected.
In La Seyne, rat rehousing is controversial
Earlier this week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building due to the presence of rats.
In response to the urgency of the situation, the director of the Terres du Sud Habitat agency proposed, on an exceptional and temporary basis, to relocate the couple and their three children to a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken on an exaggerated scale, according to Joel Canapa, the director of the office.
There have always been rats in cities.
The rat and off-road scheme makes two passes per year, and in addition, we are, at the expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, we have made 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and rats do not proliferate in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, rat control products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, we are not going to kill a kid.
"We didn't invite the rats to our house," defended the father who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We are soon penniless and we are waiting for a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
Royal Bank of Scotland will create a bad bank in-house, with Pound38 billion (EUR 45 billion) of riskiest assets, designed to expand its relationship with London and accelerate its reprivatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of dubious assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% over the next two years and hopes to have cleaned it completely within three years.
RBS also said that it would enter a provision for depreciation of additional bad debts from Pound4 to 4.5 billion pounds over the quarter, a bill linked to the constitution of the cantonment structure.
RBS also stated that the internal restructuring would release Pound10 to 11 billion in capital, thereby strengthening its lending capacity.
The bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would make it possible to draw a line on the past, the government having in particular been accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
"We can now move forward, we can focus on the future and the 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for the customer and for the UK," new Managing Director Ross McEwan told the press.
George Kerevan: The break-up of Europe gives the Scots the choice
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time, we are being warned that an independent Scotland would be obliged to join the European area of free movement in order to join the EU.
And now we hear passport control stories in Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian's wall.
While it is true that Strathclyde's newspaper indicated the possible economic fallout of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not included in the headlines (and this was to be expected).
Nor has anyone said that EU Member States spend a large part of their time circumventing their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, continued non-compliance with the rules would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in return for whatever it wants to get from the Scots.
So it's a story that's not one.
And a story so old that it's now frozen: I first heard the bobble that "independence means passport control" more than 40 years ago.
Yet we have forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe's instructions, in fact?
Why exchange the yoke of London for that of Brussels, especially now?
This is the real news about Europe: the grand post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely stalled.
With the euro crisis, the Europe Project has officially died.
Across Europe, parties that oppose the EU or advocate the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany, founded only this year and arrived out of nowhere, won almost five million votes in the September federal election and pulled out the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) in the Bundestag.
There has always been national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has been at a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, combined with the straitjacket on national economies through membership of the single currency, has led many people to believe that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments with excessive budget deficits – this was true for Greece alone.
Instead, the European system has put exchange rates favourable to German exporters – what German politicians want to retain.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe are left with a problem of intrinsic productivity vis-à-vis Germany.
The only recourse is to make drastic cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper productivity-related malaise in Europe.
As a result of the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize French and German energy companies at consumer costs – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the US.
This is a prohibitive disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wage freezes in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalised by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt is rife, particularly in France, one of the EU's great leaders.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy struggling.
As a result, Marine Le Pen’s far-right party, the National Anti-European Front, has just won a crucial by-election, referring the Socialists to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split of the right will automatically favor the left.
What is Marine Le Pen doing with her new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year's European elections to create a single anti-European anti-currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties are good at these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
That is what I am thinking very soon: very soon, the unique anti-European and anti-currency sentiment in Europe will unite and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will look more like the free “Europe of Nations” favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will regain their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will look soft in the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland, in all of this?
We can decide to be a region of small England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending a walk between Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a freer European agreement provided that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-Federdom Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
Scotland’s SNP government is – and this is worth noting – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, winning a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed (and implemented) gloom cuts by the Chancellor of Labour Shore Alistair Darling, and the subsequent Conservative/liberial-democrat coalition.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
A house preyed from flames in Old Quebec
A fire that broke out on Friday at midday in Old Quebec was quickly brought under control.
More than 30 firefighters were dispatched to 9 rue Hébert.
The flames broke out in a house of three dwellings spread over four floors located behind the courtyard of the Séminaire de Québec.
All tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was brought under control one hour after the arrival of the firefighters, many of which intervened.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw apparent smoke.
"So the alarms followed one another, because it took reinforcement to attack the building, because it's buildings stuck here," explained France Loiselle, spokesman for the firefighters of Quebec.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of the fire.
Spectacular jump in "wingsuit" over Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter over Bogota, the Colombian capital, on Thursday.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a suit with wings), it rose to 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate Shrine, located more than 3,000 meters above sea level, where many onlookers had gathered to observe its feat.
End of service for the chef de l'Elysée
Entering the 500 m2 of the Elysian kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies, the cook climbed all the floors until becoming a chef nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande to Nicolas Sarkozy, including at their vacation spots, and nourished countless of the world's greats in a quasi-anonymity that he only breaks today, at the time of retirement, at the age of 60.
The man with an open face, skull stripped and intellectual glasses, born on 24 October 1953 at the Ferté-Saint-Aubin, holds a pastry CAP.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I have passed from one castle the other", irons Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the mania of the six presidents for whom he served, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It is always the head of state or his girlfriend or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Mrs Chirac was a little more involved, she came straight into the kitchen", to the point that she had banned women in the Elysée kitchens.
Do not displease the heads of State who displayed relative indifference to earthly foods, "they are all greedy", gentle denounces Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a slightly more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had cut off the cheese, the plates were coming back empty.
As for François Hollande, who has restored cheese, "it is someone who likes to eat" and "there is not much he does not like".
The current Head of State, who had recovered the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, had "no demand for a specific regime".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure on his shoulders, especially at state dinners at the Elysée: it is necessary to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand if there were any mistakes.
The now former chef of the Elysée cuisines, who had a drink on Tuesday evening with his team, his family and friends, leaves with a pinch in the heart."
He said praise.
'His humane side came out,' he says.
The leader will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been at the Elysée for seventeen years.
A collision between two vehicles injured four people, early on Friday, on Route 131, in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 a.m., a motorist travelling northwards at Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and hit a car arriving in the other direction.
The four occupants of both vehicles were injured, but there was no fear of life.
Traffic had returned to normal at about 6 a.m. on Friday.
The investigation into Mayor Rob Ford was botched, a lawyer
After police confirmed that they had gotten their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack cocaine, Mr. Clayton Ruby claimed never to have seen an investigation "also botched".
Mr. Ruby told Mr. Ruby believed that the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested the 35-year-old friend and casual driver of Rob Ford, Alexander Lisi, and accused him of extortion about the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police also said that they had observed this man delivering parcels to Rob Ford, according to new court documents.
Mr. Ruby called the police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or tapped his phone, arguing that Police Chief Bill Blair knowingly chose not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrest the mayor, and carry out a search even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash called Ruby's remarks "obvious and desperate attempt" to stand up to the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At the press conference on Thursday, Mr. Blair claimed that there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
One fighter from the armed wing of Hamas was killed tonight and another wounded by an Israeli tanker in the Gaza Strip, according to medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to the sources, the activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between Palestinian territory and Israel when they were fired at an Israeli armoured armoured shell.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German Journalists' Union on Thursday called on its members to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services in the wake of new revelations about the activities of the US and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo's search engines and messaging services until further notice," she said in a statement.
It considers the Washington Post's information to be "scandalous", according to which the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) collected masses of information by infiltrating international networks that allow the two firms to synchronize their servers.
'The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them,' added Michael Konken, president of the union, which claims 38,000 members.
Narbonne CGR room evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR in Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, following tingling with the throat felt by the viewers.
Immediately, the director of the facility arranged for the evacuation of the room and warned the firefighters for a suspicious odour.
About 70 people left the meeting.
The persons were examined and full recognition of the room did not yield anything.
Bad joke on a tear-generating jet background?
Or unintentional incident?
However, the film management has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers in depth.
The room was airy and everything went back to order.
The cinema was able to take over its rights and customers regain the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater causing the explosion
The grandmother allegedly lit a cigarette in a gas leak.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which resulted in two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her five-year-old grandson, was due to a gas leak from a defective water heater, the King's attorney said on Friday night.
The expert sent to the site by the Public Prosecutor's Office shall ensure that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and an accumulation of gas.
The life-threatening condition of the two victims is still under way.
The grandmother was thrown by the explosion and is seriously burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his companion, was by his side and was burned more lightly.
"The two victims were intubated and conditioned for a long time on the spot before being taken to the University Hospital of Liège, she by helicopter, he by ambulance," said the bourgestre José Paulet, who went downstairs.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Sain and except, he was able to reach the ground floor by the staircase remaining intact while the rear wall of the house was totally destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the neighboring house, weakened by the explosion, were rehoused by the president of the CPAS.
The firefighters of Andenne and Namur and the Arches police intervened.
The Crisnée Civil Protection has stabilized both buildings.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners find it hard to find the money to repair the highway infrastructure in disrepair, many people see a solution in the form of a small black box that attaches above your car's dashboard.
The aircraft, which record all miles travelled by a motorist and transmit information to public officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and in the government planning offices to redesign the outdated system of financing major American roads.
The generally irrelevant sector of major-apaxe planning has suddenly led to a lively debate and turbulent alliances.
The libertarians have joined environmental groups to lobby for the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly the road you're driving on, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress cannot agree on whether to continue, several states have not waited.
They're looking at how, over the next decade, they can switch to a system that allows drivers to pay based on how many miles are flown.
Thousands of motorists have already embarked on these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS surveillance system, for an experimental ride.
This is truly indispensable for our nation.
"It's not like we have a choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, general manager of the Southern California Association of Governments, who predicts that the state will start recording the miles travelled by every Californian motorist by 2025.
There's going to be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology is there to do that.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with the taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars can travel more miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the last 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax, even by one cent, while gasoline prices are high.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed tracers on 500 cars to test a mile payment system.
“This turns out to be the most logical long-term alternative,” he said.
Wonks calls this mileage user fees.
It is not surprising that the idea is appealing to urban liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they are developing strategies to achieve the goals set out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But Representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the House Transport Committee, said that he also considered it the most viable long-term alternative.
Supporters of the free market of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of charging drivers by the mile.
“This is not just a tax rushing into a big black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice President of Politics at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they receive.
The movement is also supported by two former US Transport Secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to move on to payment mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a pilot project of 90 million dollars last year, which would have involved about 10,000 cars.
But the House presidency killed the proposal, addressing the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to work or in the city.
However, several States and major cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the country's most important experiment.
These motorists will soon pay the State mileage instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois attempted a test on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the east coast of the American East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) is investigating how it could implement change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their cars with one aircraft, drivers were concerned that the government could keep up with any gestures.
“Worries about Big Brother and things are a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who leads strategic performance management at the Nevada Department of Transport.
It's not something people want.
From the start of the test, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full location devices. ”
There is no need to build a huge and bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people's daily commutes.
Nevada is one of the few States that are now struggling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car, but without knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do that," added Khan, "the citizens will be more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to call on a small California startup called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help motorists who pay taxes to the states.
It sought to break into the emerging car insurance market, where drivers would pay according to their mileage.
But the devices she tests have been extended to major-axis planners because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, which is periodically downloaded by modem.
"People will be more likely to do that if you don't record their speed and locate them," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much cheaper ways and much less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experiment by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They may still choose not to have an appliance at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles travelled by all state residents.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing the devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transportation officials are seeking to develop a tax facility that would also be equipped to pay for parking fees, provide “driving payment” insurance, and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
“Motorists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them,” said a paper on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder whether the whole debate on payment to the mile is not just a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say that Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing gasoline taxes.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and on others whose vehicles do not consume much fuel, so that everyone pays their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgery when you simply need aspirin,” Randy Rentschler, the commission’s director of legislation and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
British police issue an extradition warrant against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition warrant against the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that it had issued a “remission notice” against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not do so, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after exhausting all possible channels under British law after the Supreme Court struck down his appeal against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would authorize his transfer to the United States, he took refuge at the Embassy of Ecuador in London on 19 June, asking the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "issued a delivery notice against a 40-year-old man who asks him to report to a police station, on the date and time of his choice," said a spokesperson.
He continues to violate the conditions for his release on bail.
The Embassy declined to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, after unveiling more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting secret information.
Letta confident in the longevity of her government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta believes that his government will hold until 2015 despite strong tensions between left and right in the ruling coalition in the run-up to the Senate vote to dare Silvio Berlusconi for his term.
In an interview with the newspaper La Stampa, the center-left leader said he had "firmly intent" to continue to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The upper house of the Italian Parliament will meet later this month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support from the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, blames him.
But part of his side, grouped around National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2 its refusal to give in to Berlusconi’s injunctions, which already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a great deal of discontent on the part of the people I meet: monstrous reassessment of their properties, deluge of taxes, cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs that are not to end.
In short, siphoning without limits on our pockets.
Millions of squandered dollars could be saved to allow for a tax that is very respectful of those who pay.
Any money taken away from taxpayers by force reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, we do not get in mind about lavish spending and the maintenance of ducks: a deficit cultural centre, a strong subsidy to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, sell them to the private company or demolish them.
It is also distressing to note the expropriation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honourable mention of the transformation of the old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost for tax payers?
It is not up to public levels to invest in such enterprises, but to the private sector on the basis of consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that the fishing lakes and the batteries will continue to provide the city with drinking water.
Following the departure of all industries (large water consumers) and the large population decline, water use has declined considerably throughout the country.
Without saying that it will be wasted, the city will never run out of water and the severe regulation of its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is easy to achieve great things with other people's money.
I would be ashamed to defend such a record.
With a gross debt of more than 200 million dollars, this city is no longer even able to buy a pen without going through a borrowing regulation.
We've been run for more than 40 years by cheerful degrees with most of them, and I don't think a sheep breeder does worse.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks on Thursday afternoon in Montreal.
The tragedy occurred at around 11 a.m., on rue Marquette, very close to the intersection of the rue Beaubien, in the arrondissement of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
In all likelihood, work on the foundations had been taking place there for some time.
An adjoining foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived on the site in order to retrieve his tools.
I was driving by car and saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who remains near the construction site.
I landed and went to remove the big bricks that covered it.
You could only see part of his back, it's so unhappy.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in his fifties who worked for a formwork company.
Resuscitation exercises were attempted by the emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector of the Occupational Health and Safety Commission was dispatched to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding the tragedy.
NSA questions “internal error” and not hackers for site failure
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said on Friday that it was a bug that caused the breakdown of its public site for a few hours, not hackers as some had claimed online.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update," the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the blackout was due to a distributed denial-of-service attack (DSD) are false.
Earlier tonight, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "not at all" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman explained.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the NSA site's failure by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactical is not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to enter the internal network of the targeted system.
The once ultra-secret NSA, a time dubbed the “No Such Agency,” has found itself in the spotlight and heavily criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive communications surveillance programs at the national and overseas levels – which are part of the NSA’s secret files stolen from the agency and leaked by the former NSA-discible consultant, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy over the agency has caused much speculation that this evening's incident was the result of targeted cyber-operation.
The Downtown Delta now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville Hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who would transform it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have still not found a new job.
Delta promises not to let go of his employees.
Employers came to meet employees directly on the spot, with individual employees meeting to assess their needs.
'This support will continue for the next six months,' explains Delta Hotels' Regional Director of Labour Relations, Félix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta is active in a highly competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned that building had a choice to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue to operate, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
'Or he was selling it to someone else and that's what happened,' explains Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Tourism Chair at the School of Management Sciences of UQAM.
Other Montreal hotels will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for the elderly.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totalling nearly 600 rooms will be launched within two years.
Do you feel like a fluo ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the world's first jellyfish-based fluorescent ice cream.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He came up with the idea after reading a study of jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the bright protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that, since ice cream begins to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," said, "It's something incredible, but we're still in the beginning in terms of production, and 2 grams of this stuff costs about 200 dollars. ”
The protein we use in ice reacts with the pH-neutral tongue.
So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH level increases and the ice starts to shine.
We've tested it over the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've created because jelly luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball costs me about 140 dollars.
But she tastes pretty good.
Charlie's experimentally approaching company, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But its next creation is to be even more ambitious.
He added, "I really want to develop invisible ice cream. ”
This is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of the jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Seriously injured in an accident with a phantom driver in the Brussels ring
A road accident left one seriously injured on Friday morning at around 5.30 a.m. in the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart in the direction of Waterloo.
The car of a driver was hit by a phantom driver, who was unscathed.
The ring was closed to traffic, until 09:00, at the site of the accident, while the road was cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not cause traffic jams, as the accident occurred at the Hoeilaart exit.
The circulation could then be deflected by this exit/input of the ring.
A seriously injured child in an attraction at Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was seriously injured as a result of an accident at an attraction at Disneyland Paris.
His life-threatening condition is no longer committed, but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat from the attraction "Caribbean Pirates".
It was closed until further notice.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the United States intelligence services, stated that he was prepared to travel to Berlin to testify before the German Parliament if the United States National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
German MEP Hans-Christian Strabele met on Thursday. Snowden in Russia, where he has the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter which the honourable Member presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr. Snowden said, “Although the result of my efforts has clearly been positive, my Government continues to treat difference of opinion as a leap and seeks to penalize political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself. ”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the US government to drop the criminal charges against him.
In the context of the complaint filed by the United States Department of Justice, he is accused of spying and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German Minister of the Interior, told the company: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, and we will make this possible. ”
Relations between the US and Germany have been put to the test following complaints that the NSA has tapped German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member of Parliament who heads the parliamentary group overseeing the foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness “without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States”, he had to take advantage of it.
Mr. German Green MEP Strabele published a picture of him with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Str-bele stated that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, he would have to be assured that he would be in “safe” there, the MEP said.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a “grave and sustained” persecution campaign that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he had been encouraged by the global response to “my political expression”.
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials – including in the US – have found the disclosure of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance to be of public benefit.
The letter puts forward an offer of cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved”.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new species of humpback dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, Scientist at the Observatory for Conservation and Study of Animals and Marine Environments (OCEAMM) returns for L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identification of new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin surprise you?
That is good news, but I am not particularly surprised.
While in the past species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge of species classification science.
Moreover, it is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology will call into question the classification or belonging of a species to a genus, a family or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are being questioned because of advances in genetics.
Similarly, two very morphologically similar species were distinguished by genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
About a decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this an important discovery, as the Wildlife Conservation Society has argued?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
While this population had been known for a long time by researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only there.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral or incidental capture epidemic arises in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local disappearance of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered depending on the number of individuals on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the ability it has to recover from neighbouring stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, from which the population of the new species is found, its stock has automatically become lower, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene mixing limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least well-known environment.
We'd rather send robots to Mars, than know what lives in the Mariana Treas, just 11 kilometers from the sea surface.
More money is spent on searching for life on other planets than in marine research, and it is high time that this has changed.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and take advantage of this system.
The mining tycoon, who contests the payment of a carbon tax of EUR 6 million, argued this argument in an attempt to dismiss the issues concerning a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott was ready to benefit personally from these policies.
“He will have a major conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets leave,” said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after his election, the Electoral Commission officially stated that Mr. Palmer won the Sunshine Coast headquarters in Fairfax by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr. Palmer put forward the idea of reshuffling the system of repelling the vote to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote has been completed?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why could we not have a system in which you can enter, enter your details in a computer, vote immediately and get the result at 6:30 the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballot papers.
Is it so that you can erase the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a pencil of paper seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission had considered possible options for electronic voting and had recently published a joint discussion paper with New zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new "very seriously" functions.
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
“We are not looking for a reward, except for the reward of history, because we have to serve the community at a critical moment,” he added.
When many equestrian protest experts gathered in Cardiff to compete and win the Horse of the Year award, they knew that the competition would be tough.
But no one expected to see Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old, win.
Not yet at school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the toddler and his pony Shetland Toffee trumped during all three turns with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable – the same size – were praised for the presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Appearing against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat cap a little on the side in a relaxed way to scroll his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his unusual natural dressage qualities for a child of his or her age.
And Toffee received very good grades for her presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and has since trained with his Shetland pony every day.
His mother Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee are a great duet. ”
They presented themselves against all odds, but both rounded up the gold cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee and we were crazy about the joy he had won.
On the trail, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale in South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, “There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged it and applauded it. ”
He ran through the entire length of the track and even though he seemed to be very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is mad at animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he cares about.
From the way he started, he will surely soon participate in the Horse of the Year event – and I am sure he will do a great performance.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said, "Fenton is only 3 years old, but he knows how to drive his pony. ”
They're a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee presented well and how they marched on the runway.
They are looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he looked really great.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that the wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was being followed by all soldiers before returning to civilian life.
Attacked by Liberals and New Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that prior to their release, members of the army followed a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them is released until they are ready, he said.
Critics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured military personnel - who do not comply with the army's "universality of service" rule requiring personnel to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
In particular, they cited two cases reported by The Canadian Press, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, with post-traumatic stress disorder, was released from the military despite his request to stay for another year in order to receive a fully indexed retreat.
His case came after that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he was pushed out before he was ready because he did not meet the rule of universality of the service.
Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared from, with plans and consultation sessions, but that it was totally different from wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the onset of major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has struggled to determine how much flexibility it can give to injured soldiers who want to remain in the ranks but are not fit for combat.
Under the current rules, seriously wounded soldiers have for up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployments, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented last year to Parliament indicate that of the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 did not reach the length of service required to obtain pension benefits.
Liberal veterans' spokesman, Jim Karygiannis, called on on Wednesday for the reinstatement of Corporal Hawkins, while New Democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to "this shameful practice".
Air raid against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese Army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday in the early afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A shipment of short-range surface-to-air missiles SA-8 was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
This new IDF Air Force raid on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in conditions roughly identical to the one that took place on 5 July: at the time, it was also an anonymous American official who confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont-surface missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not concealed their irritation of seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Life imprisonment for a former Chinese vice-governor
A former vice-governor from Jilin Province in northeastern China was sentenced to life imprisonment for corruption on Friday.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having received more than 19 million yuan in bribes, according to the official Chinese media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Deputy Governor, who was also the president of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped businesses and managers obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, said the first middle court in Beijing on his microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, has made the fight against corruption a national priority, calling it a threat to the existence of the Communist Party.
While the Head of State promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "tigers" as with "flies" - subordinate officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials were convicted, including former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most dramatic recent case was that of former CCP leader in Chongqing Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest positions in the state.
But the government has made no intention to reform the anti-corruption system by, for example, creating an independent party body.
Bombardier's profit is falling as aircraft deliveries and orders fall
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in its net profit on Thursday, under pressure from lower orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not provide in-flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft or information as to whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial launch schedule by next September.
After the inaugural flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, the latter stole only three times, and the question then arose as to whether the test phase was on track.
The results did not match the forecast and the share price fell by 8 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
National Bank Financial analyst Cameron Doerksen lowered his rating on Thursday, from “outperformance” to “sector performance” because of the stock market’s potential for upswing in the next quarter or two quarters.
“Although the drop in aircraft deliveries has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed with the profit margin in the Transport Division,” said Cameron Doerksen in a note to customers.
We believe that Bombardier will register new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program advances.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is so far modest at 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the in-flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding the energy efficiency and the savings potential of the new airliner.
Currently, the company has registered a total of 403 purchase orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, was convinced that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 firm orders before the commercial commissioning of the first aircraft.
Leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was moving forward according to the schedule.
“The test aircraft did not remain on the ground for longer than expected,” said Mr. Beaudoin during a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft's downtime.
Each manufacturer shall plan differently.
We had decided to make a first flight and to schedule an update period, and that is what we did.
This will be repeated throughout the flight schedule.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, while the others will follow soon after, the company said.
Yet analysts are skeptical that the first customer can fly a CSeries plane only 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier indicated that it was in the process of evaluating the timetable for entry into service and would provide new information in the coming months.
“This slow flight testing – although apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be delayed in the first quarter of 2015,” said Mr. Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended 30 September, Bombardier's net profit fell to EUR 147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to EUR 172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
Adjusted equity income remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue declined slightly by EUR 4.2 billion.
Analysts expected a result of 10 cents per share and revenues of 4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth aircraft manufacturer reported that it had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, up from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautics Division as at 30 September amounted to EUR 32.9 billion, the same figure as at 31 December of the previous year.
“In Aeronautics, the results were in line with our expectations, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing,” said Mr. Beaudoin.
Aeronautics'incomes have fallen by 13 per cent to EUR 2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest rail manufacturer, said that the division's revenues had increased by almost 11% to 2.1 billion euros.
The Transport Division's order book had a total of EUR 32.6 billion as at 30 September, a slight increase over 31 December of the previous year.
The transport division's margins have suffered from enforcement problems with a few large contracts.
Leaders announced that new indications would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's share price, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, Google Inc.'s chief financial officer, would serve on the board, fell from 8.5% to 4.83 Canadian dollars in the afternoon of Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third largest aircraft manufacturer and competitor to Bombardier, reported a 10% drop in its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Kenyan press indignant at controversial media law
“It is a frightening country and it is legitimate to ask the following question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?” the newspaper said, questioning the bill and asking for it to be declared unconstitutional.
“This is draconian and very punitive, and we refuse to do so,” said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said that the new media tribunal “will always be biased as it is an extension of the Government” and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and refer it back to the parliamentarians", he added.
According to The Star, the new bill will allow the government to have “restrain the media”. The Standard, for its part, stated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya “had been hit hard” and criticized the bill as a “draconian”.
The adoption of the bill comes at the same time as a package of measures to strengthen national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate shopping mall last September.
The Kenyan media aroused the authorities' anger by broadcasting images of video surveillance cameras on which the troops deployed on the attack scene allegedly stolen from the luxury shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a media official to question them, although the summons was withdrawn following a burst of shields in the media.
Under the new draft law, the media may be subject to fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists of up to 1 million with the additional risk of being “resettled” or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single fine is enough to paralyse most FM stations”.
He also says that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "animated blogosphere".
By silencing the media, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist for The Nation, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
“Delivered to their own devices, politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering. ”
Kenyan legislators have been the target of population anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the National Wage-Ordered Cuts and restored their stunning salaries of about 532,000 shillings per tax-exempt month – which are among the highest in the world.
Two 23- and 27-year-old speleologists had been missing in an abyss under the Crolles Tooth since Thursday evening, according to the Speleo Aid of Isère.
They were located on Friday afternoon.
The two men, one seasoned with practice and the other no, had left underground on Thursday at about 9.30 p.m. in order to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located in the commune of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We were then without news of them since then, the same source specified.
"The speleologists should have come out around 5 a.m." said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser to the Spéléoaides in charge of the relief organization.
Dozens of people there
Some 20 rescue workers, ten civilian members of the French Spéléo Relief, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters.
In the late afternoon of Friday, the two cavings were located.
'It was another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, passed the information on to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network,' explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers, in the 13th Battalion of the Alpine Chasseurs de Chambéry, were found "exhausted but not injured".
They got lost in the network, went back in their footsteps waiting for help, the prefecture said.
Refuelled, they should come out of the cavity with the help of the rescuers in the evening.
Aubervilliers resident launches his Suburban Party
Let us not be wrong.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Suburban Party" is not only addressed to commuters.
I chose a map of France as my logo, he justifies.
When I speak of the suburbs, I address all those who are excluded from the great national family.
Nevertheless, his project, presented on Thursday at a press conference in his home commune of Aubervilliers, was born out of the desire to better defend multiculturalism, the great cultural melting pot which characterizes neighbourhoods above all.
My proposal number one is to create a Ministry of Multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, a territorial attaché, now claims to be a "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then locally supported Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I am well aware that the values of equality that I advocate in my programme are linked to the left, but if people on the right are ready to support me, I will also listen to them, he continues.
It is only extremist parties that I am not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his programme - accessible on the Internet - from many topics supposed to speak to the inhabitants of the suburban and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16, the rehabilitation of the function of residential caregiver...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend your ideas on the political stage." For the 2014 municipal elections, this is likely to be fair, he acknowledges.
It's a problem of time and money.
The Suburban Party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I also hope to other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune claims to have seven headlists in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support emails I've been receiving since yesterday don't all come from the suburban," he rejoices.
Vibrating tribute to veterans in Menton
In the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute on Friday afternoon to the soldiers and dead of all wars.
Wraps were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by the deputy-mother Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass a “authenticity” test
The Government was currently considering the possibility of introducing a “authenticity” test for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa while considering the extension of enforcement measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion to prevent 457 visas from being used for unskilled positions or as a backdoor means of bringing family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government speech on foreign workers, saying that it could offend Australia's neighbors.
"The shattering statements about 'foreigners returning to the end' and 'jobs for Australians first' are an unpleasant return to the days when trade unions were demanding a protected labour market," she told the Australia Institute today.
Historically, this meant that whites’ work had to be protected – and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo of this historical artifact.
The working paper refers to the 12 measures that had previously been considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings, implemented five of the recommended changes, while the others are under consideration.
If the “authenticity” criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be screened for “whether the job offer is genuine in the case where the applicant is a personal relationship or partner of the owner or the person concerned within the sponsoring company”.
Companies could also be required to report the number of 457 visa holders after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually have in fact employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seeker reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum-seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The man's nine-year-old frightened son was going to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father's death on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was rushed by the Australian authorities to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
Questioning the right to abortion in Texas
A federal court of appeal reinstated in Texas certain restrictions on the right to a voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This judgement means that a law adopted in July in that State and largely calls into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The ruling of the Court of Appeal means that doctors who practice abortions will have to have an "admission privilege" at local hospitals.
Admission privilege is the right of a doctor, by virtue of his or her status as a health care member, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre in order to provide a diagnosis or treatment.
Advocates of abortion argue that the content of the law may result in the immediate closure of one third of state clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be denied access to these facilities.
On Monday, a trial judge held on the eve of the Act that the provisions dealing with admission privilege were unconstitutional.
But the Texas Attorney General, Republican Greg Abbott, who is running the office of governor, asked the Court of Appeal to overturn the trial ruling that blocked the enforcement of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted against the compensation proposal for founder and managing director Larry Ellison on Thursday, given the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding but tarnish the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just crowned with the victory of his boat at the America's Cup.
The billionaire still owns 25% of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Already last year, Ellison had been negative against his pay.
Oracle's boss gave up a bonus of 1.2 million dollars for the 2013 fiscal year ended May due to the group's poor performance, which missed its growth targets, but it received about 77 million dollars from stock options.
Its fixed salary is only one symbolic dollar.
For the post-earning fiscal year as a whole, Oracle's net profit rose by 3.5%, while the stock market price jumped by 27.5%, outperforming the S-P-500 index, which rose by 24% at the same time.
Institute Pasteur tests on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus have been negative, the Ministry of Health said.
He said that "the two cases identified in May 2013 therefore remain the only two cases confirmed in France to date".
On Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient was suspected of being reached, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already claimed about 50 people.
The 22-year-old top model did not begin his film career with the little gate.
Director Lars von Trier chose him to play Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, her next film.
This pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will come out in two parts (1 and 8 January 2014), the erotic memories of a 40-year-old addicted to sex since his teens.
Stacy Martin's resemblance to his elder is striking: a twig silhouette, a diaphane complexion and Franco-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste of risk: the one who had not hesitated to pose naked on glossy paper will be displayed in much more sulfurous situations on the big screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac raised the temperature on the Web: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their modesty in the closet, he used X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all the bodies digitally: above the belt, it's the star; below, the lining.
Lars von Trier is used to pushing her actresses into their last entrenchments, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
It's been five years since my father got rid of the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so afraid to forget about it, or rather I didn't know how I was going to continue to "frequent."
There is no recipe, no instructions for passing the wall of the invisible and finding its own.
Then there were signs.
The first time was the very strong feeling of his presence in the passenger seat while driving.
Another time, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to look at his watch which no longer leaves me, placed on the night table.
It is the image of my smiling father that accompanies me in my everyday gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting fight against cancer.
At least that's what I thought on the day I found his body empty, shrugged on this bed of crumpled sheets.
Similarly, his funeral was a glacial farewell focused on the meagre gleam of the candles that framed his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Gradually, in small diurnal or nocturnal appearances, a little shy, a little erased, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving as she regained her place in the landscape of my thought which thought she was in mourning.
And then it turned out while revealing to me my own facets that I hadn't yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost my mother's person in any way, but just a woman I didn't really know, a woman who played that person, during her time in life.
As I died, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and now I found her, full and complete.
This detour of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that loved people never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside and out" he seems.
I've always been told.
I never believed it at the time.
I had a hard relationship with him until he got old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I was able to love him.
One day he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I quit smoking, when I was afraid, when I got hurt...
He talked to me, he constantly encouraged me, he lived my body.
I could see his hands as I looked at mine, I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I was able to have a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It lasted a long time and then one day he left.
Eventually, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I no longer know who said that the deceased are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer but I feel them constantly near me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? What would they have thought? What would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night but several times a week, that's for sure.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it's too late, only, there's always one thing that keeps me from doing this moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and I feel their absence deeply.
Sometimes, some dreams on the contrary carry me and are part of my story and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
The day before my ultrasound, where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I would wake up, I was getting out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the landing and he was smiling at me and rejoicing that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to tell me that he happily shared what was happening to me.
And of course, he was a little boy in my belly.
I enjoyed sharing this moment with him and I enjoy telling this common memory of his death.
Predictedly five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year earlier, she was on a trip with my family to Cuba.
That's the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bachelor's degree that I was at the time.
Nevertheless, I mourned quite quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially in times when I find myself in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested in the Middle East, to the point of making it a master's degree in a high school, were not, in retrospect, abhorgent choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades -- before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she instilled in me are always present, so I sometimes think about how she would like me to act at some point.
The same applies to my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and righteousness of the one who was a fervent believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I see his eyes resting on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
Dead after talking to me on the phone.
I went through all the phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying that triggers alone, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then time calmed down the pain.
All that remained was the lack, this unanswered void, this need for her, to confide me, to reassure me of the hollow of its gentleness.
Yet she's there, silent presence, she's here and looks at me.
Every morning, I see his anxious eyes rest on me, I see the dark circles making his eyes heavier, the fine lines around the lips that cigarettes dig, the folds that mark the forehead on days of concern.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I look away.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at 43.
We constantly feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually relearned to smile, and pronounced his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the hollow of the night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when the morale is a little bit affected.
We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the retreat of time makes us realize how conductor she was and we are trying to stay on the path she had charted for us.
If a being loved very much, absence cannot tear it out of your heart and memories.
In a way, the loved one becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on 22 August 2008 as a result of asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted on what he thought or what he liked.
I was not able to attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my beliefs sometimes different from hers, I always wonder whether my actions are in line with his vision.
I have had problems with my work for these beliefs.
For me, it is impossible to go in the opposite direction, I do not sleep and I always wonder what he will think about it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or whether I'm just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was kind of like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, he is there on a daily basis.
I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
It was almost thirty years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was six years old.
The immense sorrow that then invaded me was of course ablated, but it is always close to me.
Very often he "disgushells" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that when I wake up I am even more sad to see that it was just a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was all right, I said no, he said, "I'm going down," but in such a real voice that I woke up jumping, anxious and lit the bedside lamp looking everywhere, convinced that it was going to happen.
I always live in the same house, and often, I feel watched and I turn around to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
In all the pieces I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would not leave this house where we were happy and where his mind lives with me.
I'm 58 years old, I've lived alone since he left, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to make it clear that I'm sociable with a responsibility profession, I laugh and I sing, I go out, I'm a grandmother, I have a lot of friends, but my heart and my soul belong to her and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Horse in beef products
Horse meat has been detected in cans of beef products, sold by two small British low-cost retailers, the Food Hygiene Agency announced today.
Routine tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained horse DNA in the range of 1 to 5%.
'As horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product,' explained the UK agency.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked meals erupted in Europe earlier this year, following tests in Ireland.
According to reviews by the European Commission, France has been the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products supposed to contain only beef.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was Iraq's deadliest month since April 2008.
Baghdad published official figures on Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day when the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the President of the United States.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We are not telling the world to be with us and to support ourselves, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," Al-Maliki said on Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not resolved, it will spread, and what is happening in Syria will also spread.
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki was speaking at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution established by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters were protesting against the Iraqi leader.
They held up placards accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to offer him help.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without its master advantage, the wounded Swedish 'latan Ibrahimovic' announced the club of Ligue 1 in a statement.
The PSG, leader of the championship ahead of Monaco unlike goals, distributed the list of players selected for this match of the 12th day, without the 32-year-old striker.
The communiqué simply states that he is "injured", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from an inflammation of the left knee when he returned from breeding at the beginning of the month.
Mick Jagger says he never dredged Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with an Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was a backup singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "He giggled me when I was 18."
She added, "That was a long time ago, and he was very kind. ”
In a statement on Thursday, a representative of Jagger, 70, said that he "deems categorically to have made advances to Katy Perry".
The representative added: “Perhaps she confuses him with someone else. ”
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Pruism", came off at number one on the charts this week.
Cling between Palestinians and Israelis on the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on the evening of Thursday, 31 October 2013, in the evening in a violent clash on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory in a year.
The Gaza Strip’s only power plant stopped operating on Friday, November 1, after its fuel stocks were depleted, the Palestinian enclave’s Energy Authority announced.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another official of the armed wing of Hamas, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shell fire in an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local leaders of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four combatants were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armoured bulldozer made an incursion of about 100 metres inside the territory before retiring.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu zuhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had died during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell in defence of the territory during an incursion of the zionist occupier into Khan Younis.
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier", threatened the spokesman.
For its part, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, which was discovered on 7 October and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed responsibility for the use of tunnels to combat Israel, stating that the aim was to remove Israeli soldiers and exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using the tunnel, an Israeli military statement explained.
During the operation, Hamas detonated an explosive device targeting IDF forces (the Israeli army) and injured 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians", army spokesman Peter Lerner said.
In addition, Israel hit an air base in north-western Syria, targeting a missile shipment destined for the Lebanese Shia movement Hezbollah, the satellite channel Al-Arabiya reported on Thursday.
A US official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not give details of the target.
"In the past, the targets have been missiles transferred to Hizbullah," he added.
Officials of the Israeli Government refused to confirm any information about such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that it did not name, the Saudi Arabian capital chain stated that "the bombing targeted a cargo of surface-to-air missiles that was destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shia movement fighting the rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions heard at dawn on Wednesday at dawn at an air defence base in Sonar Jablé, near Latakia, on the Syrian coast.
The organization, relying on a network of medical activists and sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Disney betting on tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney decided to give the tablets to its own television channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on the website watchdisneyjunior.com or via its app for phones and tablets.
Its global launch on Disney Group's channels is only scheduled to be released in 2014, details the release of its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, intended for children from 2 to 7 years old, tells the adventures of the cat Callie, the sheriff of a city in the American West where she reigns order with a magical lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is second nature for children today," said Albert Cheng, Vice President of Digital Products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the statement.
This type of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "extend the lifespan of its series and build new relationships with its audience through increasingly important digital platforms," he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under 2 have already used a tablet or telephone, and 72% of children under 8, compared to 10% and 38% respectively two years ago.
On Friday, at around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on Rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The motorcyclist, Jonathan, 26, from Fléron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the rapid intervention of the relief efforts, he died in this frontal collision.
The United States in the colours of Halloween
In the United States, President Obama has not departed from the tradition of Halloween.
With his wife, last night, he distributed candy to hundreds of guest children in the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States were cancelled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
So this year, the partygoers caught up.
In New York, thousands of people in costume participated in the parade organized in the "Greenwich village" district.
Everyone is over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the suit I had planned last year.
We're having fun like crazy," added Rhonda.
People are happy.
It's a good child, it's cool.
We really need that.
Halloween is a pagan festival celebrated on the eve of All Saints, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
Pitcairn Island wants to create the world's largest marine reserve, the Tahiti News newspaper announced on Thursday, based on Radio Australia.
This island, to the east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2 if there are three other small islands close to each other.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the Bounty mutineers, an episode in the history of the English Navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutineers, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends 95 per cent on London's generosity.
The Island Council voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, i.e. 836,000 km2 which corresponds to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the establishment of such a protected area would be a first step towards greater financial self-sufficiency for his island.
The bill is to be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, resident in New zealand, and by the British Government.
The establishment of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctuate this 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to monitor it, which is not the case.
There is no airport on Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to the surveillance of the area, and there is no port to place military surveillance vessels.
As for France, it is already having to carry out the very costly aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the EEA of French Polynesia, which is neighbouring Pitcairn.
Greece: Two killed in shooting near neo-Nazi party premises
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured on Friday evening by shots fired by two people on a motorcycle passing in front of a room of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party in the western suburbs of Athens, according to police sources.
The police were not currently in a position to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn had claimed that the victims were guards of their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police officers of the anti-terrorist service rushed to the central avenue of the suburbs of Neo Iraklio, where the incident took place and closed the area.
The incident comes a few weeks after the indictment of six golden Aube deputies, including the party's leader and founder, for participation in a "criminal organisation" in an offensive against the party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, who died in unusual circumstances, believe that their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgian teenager, whose body was found in a wrestling mat in his high school gymnasium, believe that their son was murdered, the family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 stuck in a bolt standing behind the blingths of his high school gymnasium.
Lowndes County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, but the family of the 17-year-old boy challenged the findings.
“They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
“They think it defies all logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense,” Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered for the sole purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for their son's death.
“They sent their son to school with a schoolbag and returned it to them in a mortuary bag,” he added.
United States Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, pointing out that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'm going to follow up on the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I consider there is a sufficient basis” to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as "positional suffocation".
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
“Several questions still deserve an answer or confirmation,” he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers evidence of a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A judge from South Georgia on Wednesday ordered the authorities to hand over all video surveillance tapes that the investigators had examined.
The teenager's parents stated that they hoped that the video footage would contain clues about the circumstances of his death.
Former Gestapo Chief buried in Jewish Cemetery
Muller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without ever being traced, was in fact buried in a mass grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Muller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte", he assured on a large-scale basis on the basis of archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, would respond to one of the great puzzles of the After-War.
The German secret services, the BND, thus assured that in the summer of 1949, Muller was at Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services were totally wrong.
"As early as August 1945, Muller's body was found in a temporary grave near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a commando", according to Mr. Tuchel.
He wore "a general uniform".
'In the left inner pocket was his service with a photo, he continues.
Bild also published a document from the district district of Mitte in Berlin stating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the neighborhood.
The President of the Central Council of German Jews, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by the revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormity of bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is grossly trampled on the memory of the victims," he protested in the newspaper.
Heinrich Muller was one of the important personalities of the Third Reich who were never captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and, under his command, was Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.
Egypt calls on the first freely elected president to take the oath
Mohamed Morsi has taken the inauguration oath, but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a “new Egypt” when he took the inauguration of the presidency, becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted from power 16 months earlier.
During his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He was sworn in before the 18 black-dressed judges of the court whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
“We yearn for a new Egypt and a second republic,” President Morsi said during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” explained Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, a Muslim Brotherhood group, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and harshly repressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in court to cheer up the new president and, drawing away from the presidential splendour of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow his convoy to pass through the busy streets connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Considered the Muslim Brotherhood’s uncharizable “saving wheel,” its personal prestige has increased dramatically since its victory and his speech on Friday, in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of Islamists, but of all those who want to finish the work begun in the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian president Mubarak.
“Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern State,” said Mohamed Morsi, in a blue suit and red tie, addressing the judges in the wooden-looking room where he was sworn in.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to Cairo University where he delivered his inaugural speech.
He was officially greeted by a military fanfare who played the national anthem as he stood guard.
Marshal Hussein Tantawi attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song "The People and the Army, Hand in Hand..." sung by thousands of people gathered in the grand amphitheatre of the university.
Founded in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, from which the uprising that ended Mubarak’s authoritarian regime last year, and swore back the presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the ousted former president, dispossessed him.
But by agreeing to take the official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is customary, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi on Tahrir Square has been accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
Aircraft manufacturers quarrel about the width of the seats while large controls are involved
The dispute rages between the major aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the month-long Dubai Airshow.
The conflict concerns the width of the proposed seats on long-haul flights to economy-class passengers – who are not always the most wrecked by airlines, but to which the space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aeronautics industry to set a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in the economy, but its great American rival Boeing says it should be up to airlines to decide.
The dispute erupted as aircraft manufacturers sought to sell even larger versions of their twin-engined long-haul aircraft, possibly hoping for a record order at the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way the seats will be arranged at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, will there be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic efficiency of the mini-jumbo segment.
Boeing states that its redesigned "777X" will accommodate 406 people in seats more than 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus states that the competing version of its A350 will transport 350 people in economy class in 18-inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautics giants often exchange blows on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus appeals directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to take precedence over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We've been able to see recently what might be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to financiers of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, titled, "Would you accept that?" "
“Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than in regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leahy, Airbus’s commercial director.
As eating habits change, people get fat, but seats in planes haven't changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's jumbo 747 defined the modern long-haul journey, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American from 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The waistline of the average American of the twenty-first century is 39.7 inches, according to US health statistics.
Airbus stated that his rival cling to a siege concept that dates from the 1950s, when the circumference of the device freshly dubbed "jet set" was narrower.
Airbus added that it had commissioned a study which indicated that an additional inch in the width of the seats would improve the quality of sleep by 53%.
Boeing disputes Airbus' figures with regard to the width of seats and states that it is not up to the manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also says that the study shows that cabin experience does not depend only on the width of the seats.
“It is really about providing flexibility to airlines and enabling them to do what they think they have to do to carry out their activities,” said Kent Craver, Boeing’s Passenger Satisfaction Manager.
They do not want to be told what will enable them to be profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more a question of having a certain freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute lies a race to order aircraft for an estimated amount of at least EUR 700 billion at market prices in the coming decades, enough to tip the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters first indicated in July, the configuration of the seats is exactly what fueled the battle between the latest aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a seat-based efficiency in their latest models of 20 per-haul long-haul twin-engine twin-engine models than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in rows of 9.
The gain in unit costs is low compared to the configured device with 10 seats per row currently in service.
“Boy is doing this to be able to seat more seats and make its aircraft more competitive with our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Director of Comfort Passenger at the European Airbus aircraft manufacturer.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are in favour of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
“An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus’s proposal is motivated by the 777 threat,” said interior cabin expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines must choose.
Aircraft vendors around the world even take one meter with them to check competing configurations.
While aiming to offer comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater customization of cabins by offering wider seats aisle on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern large aircraft, experts say that it is unlikely that its call to the aeronautical industry for a size standard for seats is successful, but that it could obscure the wave of sales of 777X.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel boasts a remarkable artistic direction and a meticulous period reconstruction, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Taking place in France of the 1760s, it tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the boundless cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Mother Superior and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never sheds lightness or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of storytelling could also become a penitence for the public.
Musical, this stage beast
Classic, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, productions sung and dance take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It is a revolution: French-style music asserts itself as a successful genre.
Long, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most of the attempts were mad in ridicule.
And successes like Cabaret or Les Misérables bore the halo of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at the Châtelet and from Stage Entertainment to Mogador has changed the game.
Today, these two scenes handle the titles as hit hits.
The first one takes up, this Christmas, his excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following the worldwide creation of "Un Américain à Paris".
In Mogador, "Beauty and the Beast" may well be one of the successes of the season.
On other stages, musical performances such as "1789", "the lovers of the Bastille" and small musicals such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" set a profile for success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histoires de comédies musicaleses musiques" and lecturer at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyses the reasons for the success so hard conquered.
How do French musicals evolve?
The offer has multiplied.
First of all, there are the "musical shows" which evolve according to the producers...
Some use Beautiful projections of images and a true story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others are jumping back 15 years on the pretext that you can serve something when you have Matt 'Pokora in the lead.
Afterwards, we have the musicals with the sumptuous Châtelet's 'productions that relive the Golden Age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composing.
Entertainment popularized Anglo-Saxon musicals of variety by adapting them in French.
The independent French producers tried to lose out.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Spider Woman's Kiss" or "The Awakening of the Spring" are having difficulty being funded.
Do we have enough artists capable like on Broadway singer, playing and dancing?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in one season, it is a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who run projects into projects.
In the United States, the cradle of musicals, it's very different.
Young people are trained in these occupations in many schools.
There are many jobs between regional theatres, touring, Broadway, the off-Broadway...
The talent pool is as large as the number of vacancies.
Why are touring in the provinces so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor relative of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and are often the boulevard theatre for adults and not for young adults.
The musical performances fill this 'misc'.
It's these same young people who like reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Offering young (often talented) young men at the head of a musical performance is the assurance of the craze of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are cleverly held by professionals who answer the questions.
These shows are eagerly awaited when they arrive in a provincial zenith.
The mayonnaise was mounted in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the major halls of France in the same form as in Paris.
Tokyo Stock Exchange ends down by 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended up on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rating has suffered from the decline of the dollar against the yen, which is detrimental to export values, and from the warning of its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14,201.57 and the Topix went 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony dropped by more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
Ben Greenman: 10th anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of the stand-up in America: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who played the role of master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the audience, about the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it was resumed more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows in small clubs and theatres.
"Most headliners emerged in Carolina, and were very successful, until they became too famous to play at a club," said Hirsch.
We created this festival with the aim of continuing to work with them.
This year's event will feature Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", a comedy and music evening for veterans, hosted at Madison Square Garden, which will include Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has grown, just like the world of comedy.
Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival have gone through non-traditional circuits, such as presenting shows on small television channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the stage in a sitcom on a cable channel ("The League" on the theme of FXX fantasy football cheerfully lascif) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the show "Saturday Night Live" and was part of the cast of the "Parks and Recreation" series, but is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, along with other young comedians with a singular voice (the surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ionic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell) are pure products of the decentralized American comedy world.
One of the main attractors of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting is held at City Hall in central Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all of Larry's work," said Steinberg.
He told me that, when he was here, sometimes he would go down an alley between two buildings and said to himself. Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come and live here.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, was discovered.
The US authorities described the 4-foot-3-foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagging along the same length as nearly six long football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, United States.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, making it easy to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out unnoticed, the authorities said.
The authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, were employed as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They shall be liable to imprisonment for a term of 10 years'imprisonment if convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers operate vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge for drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railway tracks from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went up to two warehouses in San Diego.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, says surveillance agency
Syria has destroyed the equipment essential for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, the international chemical weapons watchdog monitoring agency said on Thursday, as violent clashes were raging in the north of the country, close to one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian militants also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day ahead of the deadline of
1 November, set by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or “make unusable” all chemical weapons production units and machinery for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial destruction phase is an important step in the ambitious timetable for the destruction of the chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
Thanks to the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has approximately 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement was made as the fighting raged on Thursday in the city of Safira, which, according to experts, houses a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights based in Britain.
The militant group, which follows the evolution of the human toll through a network of activists based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces were killed, of whom 18,678 were fighters of pro-government forces and 187 of Lebanese Hizbullah militants.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 were opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated this figure since then.
Some 2 million people have had to flee the country as a result of the conflict.
Assad’s troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom have been linked to groups in the Al Qaeda network, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but gave no details.
The fighting has underscored the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors as they complete their mission of ridding Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a protracted civil war within a tight time frame.
An OPCW statement, which works closely with the UN, stated that his team was "now satisfied that they have controlled – and seen destroyed – all the reported critical production and mixing and filling machines.”
It added that “no further inspection activities are planned at this time”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first stage of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites because of safety concerns, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that the two sites were, according to Syria, “abandoned and... that the chemical weapons programme elements they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected”.
It was unclear whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
“I salute the moral strength and courage that you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said the Director General of the organization Ahmet Uzumcu, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly pits Sunni Muslim rebels against the Assad government and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that there had been a large explosion on Wednesday at an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Two YMCA employees charged with sexual assault following allegations against Jonathan Lord at a hearing of the Royal Commission.
Two employees of the YMCA of New South Wales were charged with sexual assaults against children following allegations against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011, at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that it “never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization”.
Director General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual assault on children at the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, that he was aware of the first case but was unaware of the second case.
He also admitted that the YMCA's opening statement was inaccurate, pointing out that “YMCA external controls were carried out and indicated that the safety of children was a top priority for the organization. ”
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the lowest second reviews of four institutions at a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that personnel management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew that they were required to report any violations of the child safety policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of 6 years'imprisonment.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's breaches of children's safety.
The staff testified that they had observed certain shortcomings, including the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, kept them in private, made them sit on his lap, told them that he loved them and let them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was under guidance from Lord and who had requested training in child protection because she was concerned about her behaviour, said she found YMCA Caringbah's child services manager, Jacqui Barnat, who designated Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time".
The Director-General said that he rejected staff testimonies that they were reluctant to report such misconduct to their supervisor.
Instead, he stated that their friendly relations with Lord blurred their judgement, so they did not report his actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his views with the New South Wales YMCA board that the organization's lesson from the “Jonathan Lord incident” should not be “reported” by staff, and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have the staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations were raised was taken by the YMCA Director-General for Children's Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that the decision was intended to avoid contamination of the evidence, but that it was an “excess of zeal” and that it had been ill-implemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there, between 2009 and 2011, the expert on sexual abuse of children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, told the Commission.
He stated that there were “serious problems” in the recruitment, monitoring, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until 20 December.
A memorial to the cremattered of the deceased
The Père Lachaise crematorium organizes, at 11 a.m., a secular ceremony, in memory of all the cremated deceased in its establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate for the Paris City Hall, is due to attend, and will then explain her proposals on the subject of funerary at a press conference.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funeral, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study carried out on 6 and 7 September among 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a loved one, the reverse is true: the French prefer burial (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, only 15% choose cremation.
In his book Death in Ash, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Femoral Ethics Committee, insists on the "violence" that cremation constitutes, for survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence done to the loved body", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which "would accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "symbolic violence", which stems from the "eradication of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of the ashes.
Why is what is accepted without difficulty in certain Nordic and Protestant countries still have been badly experienced in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," replied Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Tomatology and author of the book Apprivoiser la mort.
It has only been tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to tame it.
To promote cremation is for François Michaud-Nérard, director general of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to arrange for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as that to which he would be entitled with a burial.
The annual Ipsos survey shows a very strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their relatives, be religious (53%), or civil (24%).
From now on, 73% of people who have chosen a cremation want to organise a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For some 10 years, they have been trying to prevent the families from the violence of an expectation, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the handing over of the ash," observes Mr. Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the establishments now offer masters of ceremonies, who proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: to welcome the assembly, appoint the deceased, connect him to others, to mention him, give meaning to his death, organize the farewell.
This is the case with the Père Lachaise crematorium since 1998.
Ceremonial masters are often people who have retrained.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the Père Lachaise crematorium has organized, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of memory, secular and non-religious, to which it invites the families of the people who have been cremated in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is retransmitted online, to the attention of those who would not be able to make the trip.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
Hagel criticizes 9 US states for violating gay rights
Since the federal state recognized same-sex marriage, "all military spouses are entitled to a Department of Defense identity card and the benefits that come with it", recalled the minister in New York in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League to combat anti-Semitism.
"But some States refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in National Guard facilities" located in their territory, he said, accusing those States of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided at these bases, or access their shops.
The Secretary of Defense said that he had ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The nine state slingshot began with Texas, which refuses to implement these benefits on Texas National Guard settlements, due to a conflict between Texas law and the federal same-sex marriage law.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of same-sex marriage to about 5,600 working people, with 17,000 including the National Guard, the Reserve, and pensioners.
Oil prices continue to fall and approaching 96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about the size of stocks offset a report showing that China’s electricity-intensive manufacturing sector is growing.
The price of the US reference crude for delivery in December decreased from 14 cents to 96.24 per barrel in Europe in the late morning during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a drop of 5.8% for October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The US Department of Energy reported on Wednesday that US supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on China’s manufacturing sector that arrived on Friday, showing growth in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been seen in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude oil already used by US refineries, lost 26 cents to 108.58 dollars per barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents at Danse Danse her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second infused by the famous piano solos Gymnopédies by Satie.
An evening that shows all the prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and from black ink to white.
A white screen serves as a back wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the immense space that the Théâtre Maisonneuve is, advances, in profile, fine as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink by Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, a simple stroke, takes its form.
And this shape will be that of the whole piece: a screed of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, dressed entirely in black, only the open hands and faces, wait on each side of the playing area, rush when the next spelling appears, the incarnate, run out.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made in a relay of solos, in a group in unison (a mass that is solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each performs its sign.
We think of "Glory of the Morning", where, solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, placed online at the forefront.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is loud, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the rhythm always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the dance carpet, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux's poem, monochord and monotonous in the auction, and continue dancing.
And the music to go back, and the sequence to pick up.
This long, long, sound discharge, if that may be, ends up dressing and numb.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm also.
There are some beautiful flashes - image creation has always been a force in Chouinard - like those hairs that are ruffled or these black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
One has the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux's work, has imposed herself, with her tics.
Result: the bodies seem flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux inks, like Gestalt forms, open a wider and gigantic imaginary than dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers chopped by a stroboscopic light and white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches magic.
The audience liked it, the welcome was warm.
Gymnopedias, after the intermission, is richer.
The stage is partly draped in grey, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in a neglected house.
On the piano, dancers take turns playing the scores.
Their clumsiness in music, touching, give a real fragility.
On stage, couples pass, into loving duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving ensembles, choirs, writing is less binary.
Buffosons appear, also familiar with Chouinard, wearing the red nose, in highly polarized male-female parades.
Loves are carnivorous, fleeing or playing.
The gestures, the laughter and the little cries beautifully transpose the archaic, the grace and the ridicule of the coitus bodies, of the beings that merge.
But the play takes off after salvation.
A clown comes back on the stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes permitted: the fourth wall falls, the universes explored are superimposed, the cabotinent dancers, descend among the spectators, glossy, smoke, short-circuit, play the clapping codes, stretch the sauce in a skilably calculated disorder which remains sensual.
Joy and madness perspire, and it's the art of Chouinard there to contaminate the audience.
Heavy fire in one trade
A fire severely damaged a trade in the LaSalle borough, Montreal, on the night of Thursday to Friday.
Relief workers were called around 1 a.m. on Friday, due to a fire that had broken down in the basement of an Indian cuisine restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
The 30-year-old firefighters who were dispatched to the scene took almost an hour to control the fire.
The fire "caused significant damage to the building structure", said Richard Bordeaux, Chief of Operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on the stage.
There were no injuries, but nearly 20 dwellings, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross has been requested, as residents of one of the apartments may have to be temporarily housed, SIM said.
Report: Obama's Campaign Behind as Leaving Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisers have secretly clashed with replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to The New York Times.
This revelation is the most prominent event featured in the much-anticipated 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, Double Down: Game Change 2012.
The Times got a copy of the forthcoming book and recounted on Thursday night that the president's close collaborators had conducted "deep group work and polls in late 2011" to see if Biden's ouster could help Obama re-election as his hopes dwindled.
According to Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign officials and the White House, former White House Secretary General Bill Daley, to measure the effect of replacing former Clinton Secretary of State Clinton on the ballot.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely guarded within the Chicago Field HQ and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisors to the president – including Obama’s former campaign leader Jim Messina, and former White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that change was under consideration.
“Double Down” states that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their “close personal ties,” before finally deciding against the change when the numbers showed that having Clinton on the presidential list “does not significantly improve Obama’s chances of success.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said I had looked at a whole series of questions, and that was one of them," Daley told the newspaper.
Remember that at that time the president was not in good shape, and so we were like, "Lord, what can we do?" "
While Daley called the review "concrete," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested heavily in finding out if the change would be beneficial in the election.
“The campaigns don’t spend a lot of money on polls and focus groups unless they seriously consider taking action,” Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was looking at the replacement.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss at the time was aware of the possible reshuffle.
Although Daley said that he did not believe that the president “has been aware” of the possible change, the former secretary-general admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not definitively answer the question of whether political polls had arrived on Obama’s office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that Biden's ouster from the presidential list was being examined.
"Maybe," replied Martin.
David Bowie: four unreleased listening
The English musician hasn't finished surprising this year.
Starting with The Next Day, released in January, he concocted a luxury reissue scheduled for November 4, with several unreleased events.
Four have already emerged on the Web.
The announcement of a new album by David Bowie left everyone dying.
On his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he said that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, dates from 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that he could still be counted on to have the pop scene shimmer.
A feast for his fans
Not tired of surprises, David Bowie had more than one trick in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke planned to reissue the album on November 4.
For the occasion, he concocted a real feast for his fans.
This reissue, titled The Next Day Extra, will take the form of three discs: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already unveiled.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three tracks in the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful box set in a video.
He introduces both each of the records, but also the accessories provided with: photos and exclusive covers, a book to share his own impressions, a booklet with the lyrics...
And, above all, he gives a taste of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with high-front guitars and cleverly mastered rock electricity.
News already listening
But Atomica is not the only title to unveil its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.
The Informer is double-sided: a disturbing intro before a bright cavalcade that gradually slows down to give way to a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a little reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The enchanting guitar riffs make you want to leave the Earth.
Bowie at least has fun playing the chameleon with these titles: in turn informant, man aboard a rocket, Martian potential...
He hides and reveals at the same time, playing to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, notably with his characters ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he therefore had a mask in his hand in the photograph of the L'Invitation au Voyage campaign, of the Louis Vuitton brand, whose new face he embodies.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, which will be broadcast from 10 November.
A heft-heated bird of a platform in the North Sea was released into the wild
A bird, hefted after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea, was released into the wild.
The water rail was raised in a helicopter to Aberdeen last month before it was returned to its rescue centre in its rescue centre in Aberdeen last month.
The director of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: "This water rail was probably a wintering migratory who came from northern Europe and found himself caught in the middle of strong winds in the North Sea. ”
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil rig.
He added, "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help. ”
The water rail was healthy when it was released.
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable followers may well have access to apps like Facebook, Twitter, and ultimately the Netflix video-on-demand service via their television in the not-so-away future.
Cogeco's subsidiary reported on Thursday that it was currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of the platform with some of its users.
'This will allow us to showcase more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options,' explained Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet in an interview.
Cogeco Cable thus follows up on its competitors, such as Bell, even though Cogeco's subsidiary does not yet have a precise date for this new platform.
'We need to adapt and change or resist change and fail,' stressed Mr. Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our clients do not currently have access to.
Telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been cited, can be resolved.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in discussions with some major cable companies so that its service is available via their broadcasting platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government in its Speech from the Throne on 16 October.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite TV providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay for pay for pay for pay for pay for services.
"We've been saying that we've been saying that forcing consumers to buy important chain packages doesn't work," said Mr. Audet.
He hoped, however, that consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) would lead to some interesting recommendations.
"These discussions will have to emerge from these discussions a kind of new frame of reference to define our new Canadian cultural policy in relation to television," said Cogeco.
The CTCN has been consulting with the public since last week and are expected to continue with industry next spring.
On the results side, Cogeco reported a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 per share.
This is a decrease from the net profit of EUR 44.9 million, or EUR 83 per share, for the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline by depreciation costs linked to new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired the U.S.-based cable distributor Atlantic Broadband for 1.36 billion.
This was the company's first major acquisition after the failed one in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal company also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet provider based in Vancouver, for the sum of 526 million.
Cogeco's revenues grew by 41.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, reaching 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was EUR 43.9 million, or EUR 90 per share, a decrease from EUR 45.7 million, or EUR 93 per share, from the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable's revenues increased by 45% to 470,4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the 2013 financial year, the number of Cogeco Cable customers increased at 5546.
Mr. Audet is not worried that the number of customers is changing like this.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with very strong competition.
Alexei Miller de Gazprom says Bulgarian gas pipeline inaugurates a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said the director of Gazprom.
“A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest large-scale project in Europe,” said Alexei Miller, CEO of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security for the whole of Europe.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart from Ukraine, through which most of the Russian gas destined for Europe passes, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, adds the director.
Miller added that the direct junction to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated “forever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced price as soon as the entire project is put into operation in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction is expected to start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Unknown people shoot at a hotel near Cairo's pyramids
Unknown hooded people opened fire on Friday on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo in Egypt without causing any casualties as a result of an apparent feud with laid-off workers.
The assailants fled, said the spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior, General Abdel Latif.
The attack comes at a time when Egypt receives virtually no tourists since the army deposed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and suppresses his supporters’ protests in blood.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of the English literature classes, students will have to study at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fictional work from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also present “new texts” to encourage a more diverse reading.
A course combining literature and English languages will be discontinued.
From 2015, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education is expected to publish its new English and math programs in the future – the raw materials for radical revision.
It will make changes to other core issues next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Regulatory Bureau of Examinations, will unveil a redesign of the structure of the GCSEs, with a new scoring system and fewer courses.
Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said that there was a "great consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence", stressing that GCSEs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and Singaporean students do about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to math, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the deep math GCSE – as well as the greater emphasis on subjects in international rankings – is likely to encourage schools to work more hours of classes.
The programme will place greater emphasis on “real-world problems”, including financial mathematics.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to assemble businesses and to define what wealth and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we ordered the largest and most comprehensive investigation from British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 entrepreneurs, broadly representative of all sizes of businesses, sectors and regions in Great Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and developing while EU states are stagnating.
They want the government to give priority to new trade links with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming European institutional arcana.
When asked for their views on specific policy issues – from monopoly regulation to product laws – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
The single market has caused widespread discontent, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels settlement is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trading area – 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, are even in agreement.
Finally, and more importantly, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to pursue initiatives to change the Treaty and to develop a relationship with the EU based on trade and not politics.
This conclusion, which is reflected in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a “significant change” that gives back power to the United Kingdom.
The stakes are high – to change the treaty and better represent Britain’s interests would allow a 16% shift in votes in favor of keeping the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt for a moment: this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will be a significant change in the current power balance in favour of returning to the hands of the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, since the euro area is embarking on the path of a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses this means re-emphasising trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
Beijing challenges Turkmen Islamic movement
"Behind-the-scenes support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and West Asia," the head of the Chinese security organs told a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on Thursday evening on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC), was speaking in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time that a Chinese official has appointed a particular organization after Monday's attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uighurs from the same Muslim-dominated family in Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, precipitated their car loaded with gasoline cans against the Banned City entrance to Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two people and injured 40.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the fire of the car.
The Emily, which claims to be fighting for the independence of East Turkestan, the former name of Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the United Nations in 2002 as an affiliate of Al Qaeda.
This movement is often referred to by the Chinese authorities as responsible for the sporadic unrest in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable cornice in a quarry.
Ruby, a cocker spaniel, had escaped after a minor road accident
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the quarry
Firefighters went back along the cliff to recover the bitch and save her from certain death
A puppy was lucky enough to escape the worst after the firefighters were called to safely recover it while it was perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable projection of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker sailor, escaped after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued in a career on Wednesday.
Its owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately looked for their lost bitch and made a call to social networking sites after she disappeared in the quarry following a minor accident.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-hearted person walking his dog spotted Ruby on a cornice in the quarry, trapped at 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station rushed to the scene and took a call to save Ruby using an animal stretcher to transport her to the top of the cliff.
Technical relief specialist Andy Clayton said, “She was in a precarious situation. ”
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the summit and 15 m from the ground.
It did not move during the rescue at all – it was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate biscuits afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
Technical relief specialist Peter Lau said: "Ruby was very lucky to get out of it unscathed. ”
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for control; his general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "I was terrified by watching the rescue. ”
I didn't think she was up there at first.
It was surprising to have him in the arms again.
The veterinarian said that if she had been overwhelmed and had fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were stunning.
What they did was really brave.
We're so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely great.
Mr. Alderson, from Keighley, added: "We were afraid that she would fall, but she didn't move. ”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Ukraine approaches bankruptcy
Standard and Poor's credit rating agency lowered Ukraine's credit rating on Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet republic, which has been in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The country's public debt rating goes to "B-", sinking into the speculative investment category.
It has a negative perspective, with a negative prospect, with at least one chance in three of them that it will be lowered again within a year.
"It is becoming less and less likely that the government's strategy will ensure enough foreign exchange to meet its high external financing needs," the US agency explains.
The agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects the trend to continue.
This complicates the reimbursement of credits taken abroad.
These reserves, which the authorities use massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, is collapsing, the agency increasingly considers devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to pay for Russia's gas imports, which accuses it of not having paid a bill of 882 million dollars.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian government in a period of great tension with its Russian neighbour, infuriated Kiev's desire to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public following the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth consecutive quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its relatively low-deservation has soared in recent years, and it estimates it at 33.5% of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in budget deficit, has been calling for assistance from the International Monetary Fund for months, which had granted it a credit of 15.3 billion dollars in 2010 and has so far made available only USD 3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new tranches until the country adopts unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
Following a new unsuccessful mission to the country, the IMF noted this week that "significant external financing needs" were "repulsation", while noting "signs of economic improvement".
However, for the economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Policy Studies, "one cannot wait for an improvement in the short term".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year", with presidential elections scheduled for 2015, notes the expert, interviewed at AFP.
The only hope is to improve the international situation.
The company also notes the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which is conditional on the release of the opponent Yulia Tymoshenko.
"Taste the agreement would be positive for long-term trade, but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences related to Russia's reaction," explained S-P, which fears "trade restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukraine's exports, has warned that if a free trade area is established between the EU and Kiev, it should tighten its border controls on imported goods.
Singapore's pawnbrokers take advantage of middle classes constrained to tighten their belts
At a pawnbroker at the Bendemeer shopping mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga deposits a bracelet, a ring, and a pair of gold earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters.
“My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money has gone in,” says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 dollars from Singapore (EUR 2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is such in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, became the third pledge company to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
To pawn jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – USD 1,300 from Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga – but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore's pawnbrokers levy an annual interest rate on an effective 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requesting a credit check or proof of salary, and can release loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to pawn lenders as families feel the pressure of rising the cost of living and over-indebtedness of households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by too lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnbrokers to make up the gap as their economies slow down.
This week, the rating agency Standard and Poor's cited the growing household debt, mainly as a rise in mortgage lending, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt-to-gross domestic product ratio in Asia.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumer indebtedness in Thailand, which emerged from a minimal technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
“The balance sheet is that with rising costs, people in the middle or at the bottom [of the wage scale) seek to supplement their income as they can,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have made people quick to pledge their personal belongings to affect the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items pledged in the city's 200 pawn shops are golden.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's pawn the grandmother's gold chain and we'll come back to get it next month."
In Thailand, the largest port of leaf shop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its shops in recent months.
The increase is such in the pawn lending sector that ValueMax, the operator of the shop in Bendemeer and 15 other shops like this in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four shops – but also outside Asia, says Yes Lee Ching, its managing director.
The company will finance them using 60% of Singapore's 66 million dollars that it raised this week when it was introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-interest lenders have come up with criticism for the exorbitant interest rates they charge, Miss Yeah says that pledging not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
“Customers are mortgaged property they already own, and monetizing their personal property does not increase household debt,” she says.
Punching is increasingly socially accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed funding in the short term.
People who go to pawnbrokers are not just those who have financial problems.
The wealthy people of Singapore also go to ValueMax pawn shops to pawn gold ingots or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all walks of society.
“It can be wealthy people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment, or small businesses that have cash flow needs to take a tough course,” says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, was reporting to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed in the open
He was sentenced to three years'imprisonment by the Liverpool Assize Court
A major defence lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave sensitive information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough of investigations into his drug-related activities after he had compromised himself because of his habit of cocaine processing.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed “Bash” and considered by the criminals to be a “major case”, was arrested at home in 2011 following police listening operations to Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking.
Police officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping out three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while attending a Bar Association dinner with colleagues.
Surveys revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he sought to obtain unlawful information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were being monitored by the police at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire counties.
Together with 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for 1.5 million euros, as well as more than 200,000 dollars in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was providing information to criminals because he feared that his drug addiction would come to light.
Today, at the Liverpool Assize Court, Ditta, who works at the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, fell out of disarray after being convicted on two counts of contempt after a three-week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall came after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and placing 60 per cent of the drug drug under the garbage cans of the lawyer in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the depot, Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner party at the Ewood Park soccer stadium, pregnant at the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer returned home, discovered the drugs and they telephoned nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine. He stated that he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer as his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a “legal privilege”.
During his arrest, Ditta picked up her wallet and attempted to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from her.
During an interrogation, he stated that he owned an office at his home, as well as at his workplace and that it happened that clients called him home on legal grounds.
However, the court heard testimonies that it was appealing to major players in the drug trade, some of whom it had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, "If anyone has to know that you don't have to break the law, it's a criminal lawyer. ”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of having become too involved with private clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because it was his lawyer.
But this went far beyond the ordinary boundaries of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He obstructed the investigation of the police as much as he was able to enable him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honour her profession, but dishonoured her.
It has moved too closely to some customers, in particular Scarborough, and has allowed its independence to be undermined.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited until 15 o'clock, I would have done it immediately. ”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: “Mr. Ditta has changed from criminal to criminal lawyer as he has begun to obtain drugs from criminal organizations. ”
His addiction to cocaine had compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the ulterior members of the leaders of the organized criminal groups who had commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and build public confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to shelter behind the varnish of her profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit in Lancashire conducted the investigation into Mr. Ditta, who was convicted on all three counts of possession of cocaine and now obstruction of justice, demonstrating her commitment to sue criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals so that they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and guide you to the courts.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty to complicity in trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
A further 35 persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On her website, Ditta held a question-and-answer session about himself, during which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America, her last guest to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.
Renault plummeted on the stock exchange by Nissan's warning
Renault recorded the largest decline in the SBF 120 in Paris on Friday after its partner Nissan Motor announced that it had fallen by nearly 20% its annual net profit forecast, traders reported.
Nissan, who had to make such a review, also announced a reshuffle of his management.
Several traders reported that the Renault stock was affected this morning by the "warning".
"It's clearly Nissan's profit warning," said a Parisian broker's trading manager.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of French, according to Nissan website data.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, says official
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening, confirms a military official at Fox News.
The official did not specify which of the target was, but said that there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out air strikes on missile shipments in Syria.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of the flames in Old Quebec on Friday at midday.
The four-unit building, located at 15 rue Hébert, was the subject of three alarms at the fire department.
The fire broke out in the front, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesman for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, said that the rapid intervention of the firefighters had made it possible to prevent the propagation of flames in adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this sector of the city where the buildings were built in close proximity.
The burning house house housed four dwellings, but no tenants were on the scene at the time of the fire.
The damage was limited, after all, even though the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the sappers have ruled out the thesis of a criminal act.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists from the Centre de santé et services sociaux (CSSS) in Laval caused a great deal to the management of the Hôpital de la Cité-la-Santé, during the year 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or departures, the pharmacy department has found a staff deficit.
It lacked nearly 30% of the staff needed, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to engage independent labour, which can be up to three times more expensive than a full-time pharmacist.
No help-ups were used, Ms. Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities within the facility have been streamlined or reduced, while things are back.
It's certainly that we've worked hard to engage our young people [pharmacy residents) to come and stay here.
There is a combination of circumstances that has made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this arduous period, 2013-2014 looks much easier for the pharmacy department of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are returning to work after maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the Department's efforts to retain fruit have borne fruit, as the four students currently in residence in Laval have also decided to remain employed by the CSSS.
Now, it's much better," said the pharmacist.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
So that will fill our departures from last year.
Always growing needs
However, the situation remains a delicate situation.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or a predominance of young women in the trade, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us, we are always precarious, because we have an environment that is young and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always drive at three maternity leaves when it goes well, she added.
The last year we've had a lot more and we don't have pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.

Anger caused by the sentence imposed on one of the Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombings reacted angrily to the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by a firing squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted men in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years'imprisonment for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old man was convicted of mass killings of two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which resulted in the deaths of 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many.
He was also convicted of many other charges in relation to terrorism, including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors had applied for a life sentence, yet they could have asked that the man, who was described as “Demolition Man” for his reputation as a bomb-making expert, should be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the verge of tears, she stated that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
“He should be dragged in front of the firing squad,” Ms. Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren, or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded into a van parked outside, exploded just after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blew up a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a coma in the aftermath of the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he “dead” three times while on respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugh said that Patek should have suffered the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiyah responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keeping him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Spending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds more is not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces will kill former al-Qaeda leader Usama, Osama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden for the purpose of re-establishing links between the terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al Qaeda.
“He didn’t surrender,” Corteen added.
Until recently, he made no sense of the grief he might have caused to others.
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of crying this year,” said Ms. Corteen.
Patek may, however, appeal against his conviction.
Tony Blair has said that he will seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but acknowledges that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the fifth anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old man made his opinion on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the helm of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Quartet Special Envoy for the Middle East Peace Process.
When asked whether he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr. Blair replied, according to London's Evening Standard, "Yes, of course, but it may probably happen, so... ”
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a US drone strike in Pakistan on Friday, according to the security services.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army and the activist movement claimed this time that he had lost his life in the strike, carried out in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," said a senior security official.
The previous day, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on a trip to London, had informed the British Government that discussions had been held with the Pakistani Taliban Tehrik e Taliban (TTP).
Imbroglio on the closure of the Emergencies of the Hôtel-Dieu
Faced with the slingshot over several months by some of the staff and several trade unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, decided on 10 July to "delay the timetable for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of the emergency which cannot take place on 4 November".
A request officially made "to run no risk on the handling of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of winter" but which was also intended not to hinder the PS campaign a few months away from the municipal elections.
Despite the ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective on that date.
Even if the APHP prefers to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
As of 4 November, the firefighters, who provided about a quarter of the 40,000 annual passages to the Hôtel-Dieu emergency, will all have been instructed to take the thirty or so serious cases per day to the emergency rooms of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the Hôtel-Dieu, emergency rooms will give way to five general medical interns on Monday.
As for the transfer of beds of internal medicine, it is scheduled for the month.
"The hospitality service of the Hôtel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us it is on 4 November", says Loic Capron, Chairman of the Medical Commission for Establishment (CME) of the AHPAP, who is supporting the management's project.
"On 4 November, there will be no more patients brought in by firefighters, only people coming by their own means", confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical manager of the new Hôtel-Dieu.
'But we will continue to take emergency patients,' he tempers, arguing that SMUR vehicles are permanently on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain there, he also says.
But it is up to the ARS to decide on the closure of the emergency reception service.
"Things are gradually being done," replied Nicolas Péju, spokesman for the ARS, for whom, on 4 November, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or was lied to him," laments emergency doctor Gérald Kierzek.
Dismissed of his post as head of the SMUR at the beginning of July for having led the sling against the reorganization project, he defined himself as a "whistress" in the face of a "cynic" decision taken by the "medical-administrative technostructure".
'They are emptying and suffocating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago,' he says.
In his view, "if the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem".
They are regularly congested.
Sometimes, for example, there is a waiting time for nine hours at the Lariboiser emergency room.
At the ARS, it is argued that 30 "dispatchered" patients at several sites are not likely to represent an "avalanche" in the other emergency services, whose human resources will have been strengthened.
Both the ARS and the APHA defended the "new hospital model" already launched since 7 October and which should continue to accommodate 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners should also be involved in the establishment of a 'outpatient care'.
'Where is it going if people are asked to self-diagnose,' asks Gérald Kierzek, for whom "the concept of no serious emergency" is 'dangerous' and marks a 'medical regression'.
This is going to happen as for level 3 maternity wards.
People are not crazy, they go where there is the best care offer.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change gear, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency doctor and member of the CGT Santé.
We are going to be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will reflect on presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP councillor of Paris and elected representative of the 4th arrondissement, clearly announced that "even if the Parisian UMP were to maintain emergencies at the Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we returned to responsibility".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, recalled on Monday morning on France Inter that she had spoken out in favour of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on 4 November.
If that were the case, she would disagree, says Bruno Julliard, her spokesperson.
Even if the restructuring of the Hôtel-Dieu has its legitimacy in substance, we cannot admit it without an acceptable pattern of postponement to other hospitals.
Did you think travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecast upwards and expects record results from holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency now expects to make an underlying profit over the whole year between EUR 325 million and EUR 340 million before tax, compared with a previous forecast of EUR 305-315 million.
If the current forecast is met, this will represent 12 to 17% growth compared to the record profit of EUR 290.4 million in 2011/12.
Managing Director Graham Turner said that Flight Centre had made a profit of 8% in the first half of the year and that the second half of the year had started in full force, particularly with regard to non-business travel to Australia and the United Kingdom.
“Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries we have been in are profitable, and several of them are on track to achieve record results over the whole year before deducting interest and taxes,” he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are usually the countries that generate the largest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly declining domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the leisure travel sector of the Flight Centre performed well while business customers spent less.
Its subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses in the first half of the year where seasonal demand is lower and was expected to derive a profit from the year as a whole for the third consecutive time.
The Flight Centre's stock grew by 3 cents to reach 38.20 dollars yesterday.
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the US to fix seat back
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to address a problem with manually inclinable cases, according to a statement on Friday by the US vehicle safety regulator.
On some pickups, the front seats could have a defect at the tilt mechanism.
As a result, the records do not comply with federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
“If the vehicle is impacted from the rear, the head restraint may not adequately protect passengers, thereby increasing the risk of injury,” according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) site.
The recalled models were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the leading US car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of pick-ups of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the newsletter to owners due to the 16-day shutdown of government activities, which slowed down the growth in vehicle sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by around 20% in the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM's stock prices rose by 1.4% to reach 37.47 dollars on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
Arctic Monkeys postpones concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert to Glasgow after they diagnosed their singer with laryngitis.
The Sheffield band was scheduled to perform on Friday in The Hydro in downtown The Hydro.

The announcement came after the band was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to postpone the concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after seeking medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show to Glasgow Hydro on Friday 1 November. ”
"Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert. ”
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the show at the Glasgow Hydro will be held on 21 November.

Toronto Mayor hunts reporters coming to question him about a drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of being drugged, according to several media reports.
A video handed over to justice seems to support these suspicions.
He has always denied having used crack cocaine, while acknowledging that he has a penchant for cannabis.
On Thursday, he drove out several journalists who had come to question him from his property.
We also believe that sometimes images do not need an explanation or comment.
Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-place clergymen in the Catholic Church behind the Pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – so this belongs to a group of 120 “cardinal electors.”
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting of all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony at which bishops would be elevated to the dignity of cardinal, known as the consistory.
“Pope Francis decided to communicate his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal voters is likely to decrease.
He said that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary for the number of cardinal voters to reach 120 and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wanted.
Next year's consistory will be important because it will be the first since Pope Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe, especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance,” he added.
Forty per cent of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
Cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world to examine ways of reforming the church.
Previously, the Pope decided alone.
"François has now chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He added that it was "quite possible" that Francis asked the cardinals for advice.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is completely new.
Valero stated that popes usually raised bishops representing large communities to cardinal, but that Francis was "full of surprises – so we don't know who he would name."
The tenants have to go and vote, because each of them pays an average of 100 dollars a month on the price of the dwelling that goes to the city.
When the landlord pays 5,000 dollars in municipal taxes, he divides that amount between each dwelling.
We are obliged to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
When we go to vote, we are sending a clear message.
We need to make a difference in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We can't afford to pay 100,000-dollar fireworks, 4 to 5 million dollars for fireworks, for if...
Go and vote, that is the best way to express yourself and to say that it is enough.
Vettel strnates a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The lucky Ren, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colours of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the concepts of speed and heat at the track.
German Sebastian Vettel, four-time Formula One World Champion, spoke for the free practice of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday a special helmet whose design was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel chose from 1,500 drawings from all over the world, in a contest launched by one of the sponsors, an automobile brand, of his stable.
He was invited to follow the Abu Dhabi GP, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion up close, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday, to the tests.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, intended to mark his fourth consecutive world title.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, revealed his wife Laurie Anderson on Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for the people of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday, at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning, while he was looking at the trees and making the famous 21st movement of tai chi, with his hands of musician crackling the air," writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a Tai chi master, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she had promised her husband the week before his death to take him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even though we're city dwellers, this is our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will pass on to many people the wonderful joy of living he had," she adds.
Lou Reed had a liver transplant last May.
It tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into pumpkins
Taking advantage of Halloween Day, a woman tried to bring two kilos of cocaine hidden into the country in pumpkins on Thursday morning at Montreal-Trudeau Airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's luggage that the drug was detected.
Cocaine had been distributed in three previously emptied pumpkins.
The drug was then taken to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office, which took over in the investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman arrived when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said CBSA spokesperson Jacqueline Roby.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montreal-Trural Airport have made 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region carried out a total of 1653 seizures of narcotics.
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", is dead.
He never knew the word retirement.
A philosopher of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at the age of 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, The New York Times had consecrated him as "the author of spy novels who knew too much".
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the theatre of 198 and 199th opus of the famous series of spy novels.
Divided physically by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was travelling on the journey with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he had also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published a year, Gérard de Villiers, born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, ensured that the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first in the series, almost half a century ago.
"Without a doubt of between 120 and 150 million in all countries", he said last March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment of a building on Avenue Foch close to the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Not counting pirate editions," he added, designating a pile of books on the coffee table between the tans or the ivories brought back from the 130 countries surveyed to locate his novels.
For the price of a packet of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photograph of an advantageous young woman with her chest, carrying a pistol or an assault rifle.
Inside, his serene highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a denuded Austrian aristocrat and CIA contract agent to pay for family castle repairs, went to the homes of all the evils of the earth, communists of the 1970s and 1980s, and then jihadists from the 1990s.
Every book has the same recipe: a great dose of geopolitics and exoticism, some hard sex scenes, a zest of violence and torture.
"I never pretended to be a literary author," explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I do not send a message.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, like the Albert London type, who went there and returned with real and long investigations".
SAS' father said "doing a kind of geopolitical soap opera."
"I am constantly my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those of AFP, diplomats, people who have been with services I have known for some for 20 or 30 years.
As a result, many of its SAS are often prescient: for example, a month before the attack on a Syrian regime command centre that killed several senior officials, he told the story in "The Damascus Way".
In "The Benghazi Fools", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar El-Sadat in "The Cairo Conspiracy", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panique à Bamako", he recounted the columns of 4x4 of jihadists who founded the Malian capital.
I am not a diviner, Gérard de Villiers defends himself, I simply make hypotheses from countries that I know well and, from time to time, some of my hypotheses come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he set up for a month behind his 1976 daisy IBM typewriter typewriter "whose coins have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page to the pen.
On the walls of his office are hung AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly pinned for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sex objects in my books, but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always well received in Africa, where I have a large number of readers.
Gérard de Villiers had said: 'Malko Linge, like all heroes, has no age'.
He will not die and will not retire.
No more than me.
Nearly 50,000 households are deprived of electricity throughout the province, shortly after noon on Friday, owing to strong winds in many areas along the St. Lawrence River.
The sectors most affected are the Laurentians with 15,042 subscribers immersed in the dark, the Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The greater Montreal area also has its share of breakdowns with nearly 7,000 private homes in the metropolis and Laval.
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lights
420 patterns, 2.2 kilometres of seaside covered with a mantle of light: one could approach the hot shot in Menton with the bill of illuminations.
Invoice which, unlike many municipalities, is also paid by taxpayers, and not by merchant associations.
To reduce its costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also a differentiated management of the network of street lighting and Christmas decorations.
Beijing accuses Uyghur group of Tiananmen attack
China’s head of internal security accused a group of Xinjiang Uyghurian separatists of being behind the car bomb attack that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, drove into the crowd in the famous square in the Chinese capital, a symbol of the murderous repression carried out in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passers-by.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau responsible for internal security, accused the Islamic movement of East Turkestan of being the instigator of the attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkish-speaking minority based in Xinjiang, call this province of China East Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent outbreaks of violence that occur there with pro-independence claims.
"The violent terrorist incident in Beijing was organized and premeditated," Meng told the Hong Kong channel Phoenix TV.
"The group that was standing behind the scenes was the Islamic movement in East Turkestan," he added, with his remarks being taken up by the New China Agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he is of Uyghur origin and clarified that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers filled with petrol and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident resulted in 42 injuries.
The Islamic movement in East Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Repealed lamps: a Member of Parliament calls for the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
Minister Brigitte Grouwels' plan to 'relifting' traffic light poles in Brussels does not please everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister for Public Works and Transport launched on Thursday at the centre of Brussels a test project of repainting 16 road traffic lights in the region in the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The aim is both to "increase security" and "Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the long term, to repaint all the Brussels traffic lights, at an estimated cost of around EUR 1 million.
But the blue chosen by the minister is 'too dark', according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock, who talks about 'flamandisation' of the capital and demands the 'resignation' of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not happy to spend madly the money of the people of Brussels on operations to relifting the signalling posts in the colours of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues her Flemish operations for the capital," said Mr. De Bock in a statement.
After her yellow-mango-noir taxis, she finally repainted herself in dark blue-blue yellow-black the poles of Brussels.
According to the honourable Member, there is now no longer any difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels.
The people of Brussels deserve better than to see their money wasted by a minister on the part of the NVA itself.
It is high time to stop the Trojan horse of Flanders.
"Remember, Brigitte Grouwels was elected with only 2,245 votes, i.e. 0.5% of Brussels," concludes Mr. De Bock.
The aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is in the harbor.
The radioactive vapour leak detected on one of the two Charles-de-Gaulle nuclear boilers in mid-October and while the ship was at sea was "safe for sailors", but was not without consequences for the Navy.
The Royal has just confirmed to us the 'unavailability' of the ship until 'l't mid-November', 'the time to take the necessary corrective measures' on the reactor.
For its part, DCNS, a specialist in the naval defence, assures that its teams and Areva's teams, who were dispatched to the Var for the occasion, "currently intervene on the aircraft carrier".
For them, among others, it is a question of changing a pump on the defective boiler room.
'Everything is being done to ensure that the Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment by the end of 2013,' explains DCNS, however.
And the Navy to certify that "this in no way calls into question the programme of activity of the ship" with nuclear propulsion.
It should be recalled that the aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle emerged from an intermediate maintenance period of six months.
He had been flying from Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, with a view to qualifying young pilots as fighters.
A "small damage", circumscribed on the reactor containment space, had then occurred on the flagship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to possible radioactive contamination.
He goes into Nazi uniform at the supermarket, before he's chasing it
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform blocked in an armband with the swastika was asked to leave an English supermarket, with customers complaining to the management of the courthouse that called the police, the shop said on Friday.
"We received several complaints from customers, so we asked her to leave the store," explained a spokeswoman for the supermarket chain Asda.
The store called the police to the rescue, but "when it comes, he had already left without a slander," she added.
I was waiting in line when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were speechless.
"You don't go out on the street unless you want to get attention," a 60-year-old client, Rosina Rusin, told Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, the day of the Halloween party, where it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was unclear whether it was a hoax.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for the act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing an SS black arm twice a week for three years at Asda," said Paul Dutton, explaining that she was suffering from "mental problems."
