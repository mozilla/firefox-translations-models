A Republican strategy to counter Obama&#39;s re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight against electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center regards the latter as a myth, claiming that voter fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
Moreover, Republican lawyers have identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative influence on the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, US states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments promulgated from 2009 new laws making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon gained momentum after the November 2010 elections which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in 2011 alone.
New election laws require voters to show photo ID and proof of US citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also reduce the periods for advance voting, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day and deprive citizens with a criminal record of their right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 election, no US state required voters to show photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement.
The US Supreme Court upheld the Indiana law in 2008.
Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to show photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a state government agency.
Moreover, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity document.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18-29 do not have the required photo ID.
Much more.
Students, voters seen as voting more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their institution-issued photo IDs.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use cards issued by these clubs to vote.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are US citizens.
These measures are clearly intended to limit the Hispanic vote.
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
Separately, Republican lawmakers in 2011 sponsored laws abolishing Election Day voter registration in eight states.
In addition, they restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped register approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
Additionally, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the advance voting period.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance polls were African Americans, while African Americans made up only 13% of voters in the state.
The same was true with Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
On the other hand, the whites who formed 76% of the voters represented only 46% of the voters voting in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have vigorously opposed the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by vetoes from Democratic governors.
The US Attorney General has stepped in to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have laws requiring the presentation of photo ID.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undeniably make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and see them as an obvious objective to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that have passed these laws account for 171 of the 270 votes needed for the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Screening for prostate cancer: to pass the test or not?
Indeed, the PSA test would sometimes present erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positives, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This is enough to make men who are already reluctant to take screening tests even more hesitant.
Pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, this one European, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had screening and those who had not.
This study also demonstrated, with a follow-up after 12 years, that we have between 30 and 40% more chances of having metastases if we are not screened.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at higher risk.
The key is to make the right decision once you have detected cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
You really have to make the patient understand the degree of risk of their cancer, by offering them the possible options, by not necessarily treating the prostate cancers that are not life-threatening in the long term, and by opting instead, in such cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and not life threatening.
We will suggest that they do active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we will offer them treatment.
More and more, precise criteria are being determined to decide who should or should not be treated.
So I still recommend taking the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether you should have it or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool that assesses the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite progress in research, adopting good lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, we could prevent 30% of cancers.
&quot;If no one smoked, this rate would rise to at least 50%,&quot; said André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many also remain totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
This is very harmful to people&#39;s health.
&quot;Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; laments spokesperson André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer drops by half.
The weight
Overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to the CCS.
They increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
&quot;Research shows that regular physical activity over a lifetime protects against colon cancer.&quot;
food
The organization also recommends limiting your consumption of red meat.
Too much of it increases the risk of colorectal cancer.
Deli meats too, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
&quot;These can damage the body&#39;s cells and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; it says.
vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research, however, is inconclusive at this time.
Studies on vitamin E are conflicting, according to the CCS.
While one of them noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also unclear.
Furthermore, Mr. Beaulieu insists on the importance of discussing his concerns and his family history with his doctor.
&quot;Passing a screening test does not give cancer.&quot;
The Higgs boson dissected
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created quite a stir last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, just that.
Besides, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or &quot;least worst&quot; explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been observed. empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely sure that it is indeed the Higgs.
We know beyond a shadow of a doubt that we have a genuine new particle, and that it looks a lot like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but there is still a lack of data to be completely certain.
Suppose all the same that it is indeed the Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem slim, and let&#39;s see what it is.
There is, in this world, a fatally inescapable law that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don&#39;t try too hard, you&#39;ll hurt yourself.
But even if particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it too has a law of this kind: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot; - this &quot;state&quot; roughly consisting of some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner, there are good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli&#39;s principle.
And in the other are the bosons, a filthy bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for this principle, which means they may well be in the same place , at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure, from Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not discuss here, and the &quot;force particles&quot;, by which the great forces of nature are propagating and to which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, it should be emphasized here, are not all such exotic critters as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon, or the &quot;particle of light&quot; which is the &quot;messenger&quot; of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it &quot;disturbs&quot; the electromagnetic field in that precise place, a bit like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this &quot;disturbance&quot; is born an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a photon - and therefore, one of the force-carrying bosons.
More stable field
It is the same with the Higgs boson, except that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be &quot;disturbed&quot; for this boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, you have to reach very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond whose surface only a very large rock could ripple.
That&#39;s why you need a huge particle accelerator like the one at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring 27 km in circumference! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
It is indeed not all the particles, nor all the materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but some don&#39;t - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold up on a fridge on its own.
And similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have mass, while the others (like the photon, well) don&#39;t.
Now, what can all this research &quot;contribute&quot;, asks Ms. Plamondon?
For science, this serves to check the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any discrepancies between observations and predictions of the SM.
They are moreover several to ardently wish that we find some, because the slightest difference could open a door on a &quot;new physics&quot; and plug some holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has huge deficiencies, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter in the Universe (oops again!) .
But no such discrepancies have been found at CERN so far.
Implications
The repercussions of this research in the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. Everybody are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will not be any.
Look: at the very beginning of the 1960s, the laser pioneers at Bell Laboratories had no idea of the revolution that their work was about to trigger.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle once told us - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed), by 1962 -, initially the laser was seen more as a &quot;lab gadget&quot;.
Imagine...
And then, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work in optics.
This sensor, although it was not at all its original intention, now serves as the &quot;eye&quot; of all digital cameras in the world, and won it the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it does mean that, really, you never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die... | The duty
With its Dying with Dignity Commission, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
Debate is due to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
However, in this essential area, much remains to be done.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look.
Barely a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was gnawing at him had given him a respite for two years.
“They gave me five years to live, I did seven years,” he says, half fig half grape, lying in bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he is. arrived the day before.
&quot;But it&#39;s always a shock, you can&#39;t be prepared for that,&quot; he said.
The disease does its work: an enormous weakness that prevents him from going to the toilet alone, and even from eating alone.
Seated in front of an appetizing lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even manages to smile, talks to strangers who bustle around him, bring him his medicine, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
&quot;My biggest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it&#39;s humiliating,&quot; he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this ailment.
“During our life, we learn that a man pees standing up,” says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
To regress to the stage of childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“It depends on the capacity of the person” to accept the regression, he notes.
Because, in the opinion of many people working in palliative care, great moments are taking place at the very heart of this regression.
The patients who come to the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life prognosis of three months.
At this point, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provide so-called &quot;curative&quot; care.
For Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is to die &quot;conscious and suffocated&quot;.
But the disease made me discover my children.
“I have good children,” she adds.
&quot;I have no more wishes in life,&quot; she said, before agreeing to have a mask put on her to help her breathe.
She is still expecting, in the coming days, a last visit from her son who has come from Italy.
At Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, we provide body care and food assistance.
This is palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It&#39;s very little when you know that we all end up dying one day.
Here, life goes on in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the house doctors.
Whether in terms of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
To the dying, we will agree to provide mouth care with brandy or Pepsi, depending on the request.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, a beer was served to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, it is his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help loved ones as much as patients,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days go by but are not alike.
Alongside a 93-year-old man who is enjoying his last family gathering in the yard, snuggled up in his pillows while we toast in his honor, a 36-year-old young man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, of his wife and two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
“For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,” worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Maison Victor-Gadbois come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to say care designed to ease the suffering when a patient has reached the end of his life, whether either at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as Maison Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Palliative Home Care of Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients.
It is precisely this major deficiency in Quebec health care that makes many doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by luminaries of palliative care including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before they agree to proceed with euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency room, in great pain, without anything being done to relieve her.
I fear that patients only ask to die because they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists work hard on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognoses.
Hélène Richard&#39;s hopes of survival were already minimal when she gave up trying chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she said.
However, she had told me that I was finished!
Not almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank caregivers for not granting their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Palliative Home Care Society, patients are refractory to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors then often resort to palliative sedation, which amounts to putting the patient to sleep until the moment of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the possibility of having this palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: &quot;I want to die.&quot;
But that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean &quot;I want you to euthanize me&quot;, it means &quot;I want to be relieved&quot;.
This report was made possible by a Canadian Institutes of Health Research Journalism Fellowship.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction contractors, political party fundraisers and specialists in the Italian mafia tell day after day what they know about a formidable &quot;system&quot;, mixing the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso.
An &quot;industry&quot; that cost Quebec taxpayers dearly, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
&quot;It&#39;s curious how the system has crumbled since we took drastic measures,&quot; quips Jacques Duchesneau, MP for Quebec and former police chief of Montreal.
It was through him that the scandal erupted in 2011, through a substantive investigation into embezzlement linked to roadwork contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister at the time, Jean Charest, n had consented only reluctantly.
The &quot;Duchesneau report&quot; established a direct link between industry, secret party funding and official corruption.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he underlines, the only ministry of transport would have saved a billion dollars on the contracts”, certain curbing their instincts to touch a quota!
The Charbonneau Commission &quot;has already brought down two mayors&quot;, he adds, hoping that it will succeed in &quot;demonstrating the schemes behind the individuals&quot;.
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also working on this with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
Plus the police officers of the &quot;Hammer Squad&quot; who, since 2009, have allegedly led the &quot;sewer cartel&quot; of Montreal to put a soft pedal on the inflation of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out a series of searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against elected municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban town.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec&#39;s third-largest city.
He is suspected of having pocketed repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Also formally accused are road engineers in Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter caused a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the &quot;system&quot; for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who transferred the money to Union Montreal, the party of mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito sowed the seeds in the 2000s, donating more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power.
He also admitted to having organized an illegal fundraiser for the former Liberal deputy prime minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts whose costs he inflated
In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption worked smoothly.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained it well before the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and kickbacks. de-vin totaling $736,000, in exchange for sewage contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other civil servants of the road network have confessed to having greased their paws by inflating their bills by 30% to 40%, with bogus extras.
Then an organizer from the mayor&#39;s party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of having deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel budget feeding his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected officials in Montreal to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the borough of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she protested in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought for 5 million dollars and resold... 1.6 million to developers, in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% dirty money in election campaigns
Of the investigation that will finally be put in place, she says that she &quot;pulls on a thread allowing us to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pin down the culprits&quot;.
The process, she says, is &quot;painful but positive&quot;.
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but we need a specific investigation unit in Montreal and a watch, so as not to see dubious practices return.
How we clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part that &quot;officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars&quot;, but is especially worried about the role of &quot;elected officials aware of the scheme&quot;, when they were not involved in the scheme!
Estimating at 70% the share of dirty money in the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he quips: &quot;I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality.&quot;
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but this will not change the situation, according to him: &quot;As long as we do not strictly limit election expenses, there will be dirty money in politics.&quot;
He advocates a complete overhaul of the system for awarding public contracts and party financing: &quot;We can&#39;t go any lower; getting to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house on more solid foundations, with more controls and laws.&quot;
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh about it to look in their own backyard...
&quot;PSG is not FC Barcelona!&quot;
This season, you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I progress alongside them.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And, in matches, it&#39;s easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I don&#39;t get excited.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training center to my time in Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed in stages.
So you take advantage of the competition set up by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer&#39;s recruits are used to playing very high level matches.
They also know that every workout is crucial.
What makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot in terms of my positioning.
He is supported by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has great experience and has won many titles with top clubs.
He rubbed shoulders with great players.
I think he will win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a heartwarming discussion with him.
I was then coming out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he places in me also explains my performance.
How do you view the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the lead from us.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our major objectives is the Champions League: we qualified for the round of 16 in style.
What is the club&#39;s objective in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
Now anything can happen.
But we will have our say against very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, ahead of Porto, to be able to receive in the round of 16 second leg.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and stay in the long term.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, PSG is giving itself the means to make this project a reality.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this championship title.
Last season, we didn&#39;t go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, one is supposed to be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, had an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it&#39;s the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have what it takes to win.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It&#39;s normal that we expect a lot from us given what has been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
Afterwards, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to reproach ourselves for, it is sure that it is a little frustrating.
One wonders what more people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to set up a game project.
A team is built over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we could be present.
Look at Manchester City who have not been able to qualify for the round of 16 for two seasons, they have also made huge expenses!
In view of the sums invested, we imagined you with a 15-point lead at the break!
It was to neglect our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, have been &quot;boosted&quot; by this new PSG.
It shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up winning.
PSG seem totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better that we say that there is a &quot;Zlatan dependency&quot;.
This means that Ibrahimovic is very efficient and that he scores a lot of goals.
He came for that and he proves that he is the star of Ligue 1.
He demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the France team?
Like a disappointment.
I was keen to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from getting playing time.
I saw things there and I came out stronger.
Today, I manage to make good matches in the national team.
This is what I had hoped for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine and we must behave in an exemplary fashion today.
How do you view the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires winning.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don&#39;t want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good draw (1-1) snatched on October 16 in Spain a founding match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone else.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced such a match in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows the exchange peer-to-peer files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars, five months later, before returning today to around ten dollars (the prices are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes bitcoin as &quot;the most successful virtual currency&quot;, &quot;competing with the dollar or the euro&quot; and &quot;similar to conventional currencies&quot;.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as &quot;credits&quot;, used to progress in a video game that is earned by playing or can be purchased (and sometimes traded back).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But, each time, a central authority controls and processes the exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are both bookkeepers, verifiers, issuers of currency, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two electronic addresses in the manner of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged exist in the public account book, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It passes by the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to the computers, and whose winner, sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add this additional line.
This is a file hash phase, that is, the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital fingerprint.
The computers &quot;take&quot; the new transaction and add a number to it before &quot;hashing&quot; the whole thing.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular fingerprint (lots of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the correct one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to defraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphan because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to the hundred millionth, which leaves room...
The difficulty of the challenge is also raised with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had its ups and downs.
Websites providing services for bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoin deposits stolen.
&quot;The flaw used does not concern the protocol itself&quot;, assures Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a payment company in real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also mentions the possibilities of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash also has this defect.
Major players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the blogging platform WordPress, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not circulating.
In November, &quot;giant sales&quot; were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are therefore cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
All they have to do is communicate an address that a telephone can &quot;photograph and recognize&quot;, specifies Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
“Bitcoin will take time to take hold, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We left from Afghanistan.
And after ?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting everything from us.
It is above all the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them to be terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former chiefs who have taken refuge in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign armed presence, as in the days of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes helped by the local insurgents, these will no longer be so when the Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was done in order.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked, hovered over by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban surge in Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country had then been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghan women paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants overwhelmed by the organization of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved these days.
Former mujahideen, Afghan government and current Taliban come together in the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have turned into wheeler-dealers, seizing government land to resell it as building land to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge American subcontracts.
They have discredited themselves; most of them did not fight themselves.
The people, as I have heard in the countryside, yearn for a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have taken advantage of American largesse: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They rubbed shoulders with the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the government schools are full, of girls as well as boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties nor to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish serials which present a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who will order it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already preoccupied with reconstituting provincial militias, which will escape the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization, like Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, eliminating the post of Prime Minister which had existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially in the run-up to elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been, since the 1950s and long before, dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been restarted, no dam is in working order, no major irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
It was rumored that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth.
It only added to the feeling that Westerners were just there to grab it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or means of transport to export it across the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the huge Buddhist site and remain the province&#39;s largest employers.
It will also be necessary one day for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports largely depend, to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French combat troops was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school for girls and boys, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to &quot;win hearts and minds&quot; and carry out the impossible task of matching aid and offensive actions, a &quot;civil-military actions&quot; service of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012 , has carried out, and had carried out by a small French NGO, numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, greedy in local labor, were able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in cultivable areas.
What will we leave behind, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often located at more than 2,000 meters in altitude.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurrection led by foreign groups, which the farmers have told me they want, there should be a small amount of well-controlled civilian aid that affects them directly.
A Forceps Constitution in Egypt
It&#39;s a new gamble by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants him full powers, he has decided to gamble.
Taking everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State granted this Assembly two additional months to complete its work.
For nearly two years now, Egypt has been relying on a provisional text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased the divide in the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his &quot;autocratic delirium&quot;, continuing to &quot;betray his word&quot; and &quot;trample on the law&quot;.
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way of ending the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be organized within fifteen days.
A very short lapse of time which obliges the Brothers to give up their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of regaining popular and democratic legitimacy while protests are raging throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Especially since this recourse to a hasty vote is an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: &quot;Either you vote for my text, or I keep full powers&quot;, these should supposedly end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, with a large Islamist majority, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were missing.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, believing that they had not been able to assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, substitute members, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, most articles were voted on unanimously.
Commentators were also amused by the fact that one of the only divergences of the day was expressed around... the hour of prayer, certain members of the committee considering that the pendulum of the constituent was badly regulated.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, comprises 234 articles.
Objects of all attention, article 2 ultimately remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that &quot;the principles of Sharia are the main source of law.&quot;
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major demand, hoped to be able to replace &quot;the principles&quot; by &quot;the rules&quot;, which would have allowed a stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a sign of their goodwill and their respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy”, answer the liberals, who see it only as a communication stunt.
Because according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They notably target Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying the compliance of laws with Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because &quot;the people called upon to speak out are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see there the beginnings of a theocracy.
Liberal fears are further stoked by the fact that the next rector of this university should be far less moderate than the current one.
&quot;For the time being, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who worked on this text are not ulema but academics, some trained in the French system&quot; tempers Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes &quot;that there may be an ambiguity around article 220, because the terms used borrow from religious vocabulary.
Reference is made there to &quot;fiqh&quot; in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, editor&#39;s note].
And the question could in the future arise as to what extent civil judges are competent to decide on it&quot;.
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argue that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another contentious point: the powers granted to the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the Defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defense Council.
Nor will the trials of civilians in military tribunals be prohibited, as demanded by associations for the defense of human rights.
The latter also express their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticidal.
The offense of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, particularly of the press.
In addition, no article echoes the protection of women more, underlines Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Supporters of the Head of State will parade on Saturday.
In Israel, holy sites, the Center of the World and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the grandeur of biblical truths, modern comforts and a wilderness.
Argoumenty i Fakty has identified five main reasons for visiting Israel.
Go worship the holy places
Must-see: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that whoever enters these &quot;baptismal fonts&quot; will be touched by divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of Jesus&#39; miracles: where the water was changed into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm or where fishing was miraculous.
It is at this precise place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places is in Jerusalem.
Believers walk the Rue de la Souffrance or the Stations of the Cross (in Latin: the Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the Antonia Fortress (praetorium), where the trial was held, then leads through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher on Golgotha, towards the place of the Crucifixion , then to that of the Stone of Anointing and the Entombment.
Here is the Christian center of the world, symbol of the salvation of mankind.
According to Christian legend, the Monastery of the Cross is erected on the spot where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest place for the Jews: the Wailing Wall which is the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC. JC.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave little notes there accompanied by prayers which are then answered.
Travel high
Visit the ruins of the Masada fortress, an ancient refuge from enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC. JC. for her family.
These ruins are on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can get there by their own means.
For the others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m above sea level, is the ski resort of Mont Hermont which welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
Old beliefs hold that pagan gods once inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country is home to nearly 300 museums.
Impossible to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are definitely worth a look.
First up: the Israel Museum located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the very ancient Qumran Scrolls, or Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
Also worth seeing: the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
Mainly exhibited are paintings by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths made up of casts of visitors and supervisors of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures by Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which revisits the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the Children&#39;s Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and step into total darkness.
Stars twinkle.
You then hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
health and wellbeing
Israel&#39;s three major resorts are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, because the temperature of the water does not drop below 21° while that of the air can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, this is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point on Earth - 417 m below sea level.
The azure colored water contains brine and very easily retains bathers, even those who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscapes are of surreal beauty.
People come here to carry out a treatment based on salt water, silt, curative muds and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of antiquity
They are guarded by the old city of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and that Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists especially like to walk through the narrow streets named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to &quot;your&quot; sign, fate will smile on you.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds who have come for photo shoots from all over Israel and even from other countries.
In Caesarea, city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater, &quot;conquer&quot; the Crusader fortress.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, notably Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to tourists
If you are going to Israel, don&#39;t worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer dollars to euros, since they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar is equal to 3.8 shekels).
As for urban transport, it is mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and able to connect the lower and upper parts of the city. .
It is almost an underground funicular.
The trip on all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition is to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport stop operating.
And the working week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels only serve kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and mixed milk and meat dishes.
It offers a multitude of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts made with coconut milk, but also hummus, traditional Jewish pasta, different sauces, balls of ground chickpeas, falafels, Fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that walk around looking haughty.
They can be seen in the evening sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
These felines love busy places and do not refuse to be treated.
Renting a car varies by brand from $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Admission to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The language of numbers
Three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mostly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
&quot;Who language has, in Moscow goes&quot;: migrants save money to learn the language
As MPs and human rights activists argue over what the mandatory language test law will do, scammers selling &#39;fake&#39; certificates have already appeared in the country
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to earn money to help their families at home.
Since December 1, a law has come into force stipulating that every migrant worker will have to pass a Russian language exam.
At this time, this rule only affects those who intend to work in the service, housing, personal services and retail sectors.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, testing will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the History of Russia and the foundations of law.
You will have to validate your language skills in Russian to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has the status of an official language are exempt.
People who obtained teaching certificates or diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not affected by this law.
Profit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centers will be under the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, Peoples&#39; Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take the exams in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centers have already been opened throughout the territory.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But, before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly posed the question in the press: what will happen?
What will the requirement to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, say the representatives of the migration service, it will reduce the number of people suffering from &quot;work slavery&quot;.
Many talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, certifies Sebelev, the future migrant is destined to come across dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a &quot;trip&quot; to an overcrowded cottage where he and dozens of his fellows will torment themselves for months without food and without paper and will have to toil between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
&quot;At home, we promise them one thing, and when they arrive, we deceive them, we take their passport, and they do not receive the expected salary&quot;, confirms the Head of the Directorate of Migration Services for the work of the Migration Service from Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.
Don&#39;t argue with me, policeman!
However, many nationals of the Central Asian republics who wish to come and earn money in Russia confide that they not only do not know the language of the country where they wish to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is of course not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow even a passable primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have enough to feed their children let alone dress them properly and equip them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people leave to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It&#39;s difficult when you don&#39;t know the language, they say.
&quot;You feel diminished and belittled.&quot;
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the language law.
The exams will be intended only for migrants who have legal status.
Without status, there will be no exam or official work afterwards.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
&quot;Welcome or no entry&quot;
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain an official status in Russia.
The reason? The administrative barriers and always these linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
And then one can get a fake registration quickly for only 1500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we have no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
&quot;They ask us for 100, 200 rubles, enough to buy cigarettes, tea,&quot; Oumed Khouchkadamov, a national of Tajikistan, told reporters.
&quot;Hurry up, don&#39;t skimp and buy yourself a beautiful piece of art&quot;
From the first day of the entry into force of the law relating to the language, it was discovered that the registration papers of the migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
Forged papers come out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not get them for nothing: each migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of examinations in this way had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: the latter will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Power officials and human rights advocates agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these &quot;pieces of paper&quot;.
The authorities can give migrant workers who were unable to pass the exam on the first try time to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in fields that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to toughen the law against carriers of civilian weapons.
Such is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it is the shootings carried out at weddings or the massacre organized by the Muscovite lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which left seven dead.
Police want to ban the carrying of rubber bullet guns in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a gun license from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee for security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya who promised that the amendments to the law on weapons would be introduced in the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is happy to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by &quot;tightening the screw&quot;.
An open letter has appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demand to abandon &quot;this senseless hardening&quot;.
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime expert for the BBC, told the Russian service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services while 1,168,000 crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that tougher civilian gun laws will not prevent criminals from sourcing on the black market.
According to them, today in Moscow you can find any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior claims that it controls the distribution of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from the factory to the officer
The black market for weapons is supplied through several channels.
The main canals are five in number, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served ten years at the Ministry of Education and at Headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site taking orders for weapons
The first is &quot;the military trace&quot;, that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
&quot;These weapons were stolen by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians&quot;, explains Baranets.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals from law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stocks and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of these often suffered explosions.
&quot;Attested versions indicate that some fires were set on purpose to conceal the deficit,&quot; explains the former soldier.
For Baranets, the arms manufacturers have something to do with it.
&quot;We see private arms factories that do not compete with the competition on the international market and sell weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow,&quot; says an expert.
Another source of the black market is contraband.
A significant share of pistols and submachine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
&quot;There is local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organizes the supply,&quot; adds the former soldier.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts have estimated each source&#39;s approximate share of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was compiled in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers explain, come from the military and law enforcement agencies.
Half of the weapons present on the black market ended up there &quot;through the fault of the employees whose work is related to the weapons&quot;, explains one in the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from the places of military conflicts, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% come from &quot;clandestine excavations&quot;.
A salesman and consultant from an armory who asked to remain anonymous assures that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these clandestine excavation specialists; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, sellers pick up new goods from military warehouses.
The person buys through a sign a unit, for example a TT pistol.
It is delivered to him by passing the goods through a fence.
“He transports it to town and resells it for €900 per unit with two chargers,” he says.
&quot;It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so when crimes are about to be solved, they make a control purchase from illegal arms dealers&quot;, adds the salesman.
&quot;Like in a luxury boutique&quot;
The seller and buyer are usually found through acquaintances.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered to come to Begovaya station where someone had to take me to a &quot;corner&quot; to haggle.
The price of the gun, they gave it to me on the spot
Victor Baranets as a military observer
To find a gun, I have to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don&#39;t trust him.
There are vendors in the markets, but there you also have to come saying, for example, &quot;From such a person, who asked me to report that his daughter has lost a tooth&quot;.
Now I even buy a pair of brass knuckles using someone I trust.
He only delivers them to me because he knows I won&#39;t give them away.
Newbies search for weapons in different ways.
Former military man Victor Baranets tried his hand as an illegal arms buyer in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, according to him, have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which there was &quot;everything you want&quot;.
&quot;I thought I was in a luxury store,&quot; recalls the soldier.
There is no secret for the buyer, explains Baranets, you can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don&#39;t just buy, we go with the seller into the forest and set up a target.
&quot;They let me shoot and when I am convinced that the weapon works well, we start to negotiate&quot;, describes the expert.
A shop from your couch
Search engines show sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons &quot;for different purposes&quot;.
For this, we do not need any document and no one to meet.
&quot;It is enough to have a precise sum of money&quot;, one writes in advertisement on the site &quot;Buy a pistol or a combat submachine gun&quot;.
Users leave their request there and ask their questions.
And we sell to minors?
&quot;Without a permit, of course,&quot; asks user &quot;Ivan&quot; (spelling retained).
&quot;Buy TT. Moscow&quot;, writes &quot;Fedorenkov&quot; in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has spread a huge network of fake sites and is shoveling in people who want to buy combat weapons.
People rush for food like hungry wolves and then they end up mining coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and former soldier
I heard about such schemes: usually the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment at the automatic terminals.
&quot;He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden&quot;, explains the secretary of the association &quot;Right to a weapon&quot;, Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, you can end up unarmed and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has spread a huge network of fake sites and is shoveling in people who want to buy combat weapons.
&quot;People rush for food like hungry wolves and then they end up mining coal in Siberia&quot;, - he says.
A Makarov for 100 dollars
Buying an illegal firearm, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov from the &quot;Right to a Gun&quot; association, you can buy a Makarov pistol for 100-300 dollars.
It will take about a month and a half.
It is released from long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official data from the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of such crimes as a whole decreased in Russia by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, while proven cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs fell by 7.8%.
United States: workers in fast food restaurants and supermarkets are on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teens go through cashier jobs at McDonald&#39;s
In recent days, a wave of protests has mounted against the low wages charged by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald&#39;s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy&#39;s and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will gain momentum or fade quickly.
These actions are supported by the unions and a number of left-wing associations.
Along with the modest wage increases received by rank-and-file workers at Walmart and fast-food chains, protest organizers are seeking the creation of unions.
This sector is currently not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the &quot;Black Friday&quot;, when a surging rain of sales gripping millions of inhabitants descended on America and sometimes triggering scandals.
On that day, some employees of the company Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their posts to picket with unions and left-wing activists in the company&#39;s stores, whose products are aimed at low- and middle-class consumers.
Walmart markets everything from diapers to shotguns to car batteries to vacuum cleaners to eggs and milk.
The products there are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That&#39;s why many low-paid employees at Walmart shop only at their place of work.
Price and product selection have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheap in part because of the low salaries of its employees.
The latter also complain of difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklifts or portable scanners.
Participants of the &quot;Black Friday&quot; protests were demanding a pay rise, they complained that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had risen from $30 to $100 a month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who earns $9.5 an hour, this is an amount he cannot afford.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
That&#39;s 1.1% more than he currently spends.
If Walmart shifted all wage increases onto the shoulders of consumers, every trip through the store would cost them 46 cents more.
They will spend in a year only $12.39 more than they do now.
Walmart supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in just nine states and did no harm to the group.
&quot;Black Friday&quot; continued in stores from 8 p.m. to midnight the next day, and Walmart sold 5,000 items per second during that period.
Its cash registers carried out a total of 100 million transactions for &quot;Black Friday&quot;.
Company spokesman Dan Fogleman assured in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post that in all &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart employees had left their posts and that the protest was only a &quot;com &#39;among many others&quot; from the organizing union.
&quot;Next Customer!&quot;
The protests continued this week in New York and were no longer at Walmart stores (in this progressive city they are not very popular, which is why they are not yet established there) but at McDonald&#39;s and other good restaurants. market.
McDonald&#39;s advertises selling billions of servings and then they don&#39;t even give you sick leave and don&#39;t pay you for the work you honestly did!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants increase over time, but by little, on average their basic employees earn $8.90 an hour in New York.
Nobody gets less than them in this city.
For me it is inconceivable to live with this sum in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald&#39;s after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for long.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald&#39;s employees who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper one finds comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you do not know with what you are going to feed them.
Protesters who started the movement at 6:30 a.m. Thursday near the McDonald&#39;s on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue demanded that fast food cashiers and cooks be paid a minimum of $15 an hour, a more than twofold increase times the current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be created in the fast food sector.
US law prohibits the administration from interfering with this and punishing union protesters with bullying or firing.
However, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
For a union, taking over fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary staff turnover.
They do not agree
Other tumultuous demonstrations were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the mid-day rally near McDonald&#39;s in Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic politicians, including City Council Member Jumaane Williams, who said: &quot;McDonald&#39;s announces that it will sell billion servings and then they don&#39;t even give you sick leave or pay you for the work you honestly did!&quot;
The protesters were backed by other prominent New York Democrats, including mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio who said &#39;we all need to support fast food workers to get a fair wage and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized the protest as the largest for the fast food industry in its history.
But only a few hundred people took part, not to mention that not all of them were fast-food employees, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is for the moment difficult to say if this spark of mass movement will make children.
&quot;For the moment, we can only moderately deceive the brain&quot;
Lately, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to perceiving augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google that unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November we learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it appears from the interview with the director of the group of interactive 3D technologies of the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are already ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group does?
- We work on the interaction between man and machine and we try at the same time to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained for the moment with pixels on flat screens and sometimes with touch.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead of us and guess what drastic changes will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What does the future also hold for us?
- Although the Kinect made the interaction physical, a lot of things happen on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the output, for the moment, not really.
We&#39;re trying to change that and we&#39;re working on true 3D imaging systems that run on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We have to bring the computer world out into ours, into the physical world, make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space around him.
Thus, we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And for starters, let&#39;s get rid of those stupid VR headsets!
- What do you think of the voice command?
She is appreciated, but isn&#39;t she overrated?
We cannot say that this is a panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because we do not always want to inform others of our actions or our intentions.
In fact, every type of computer interaction is good, but each in its own niche.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not large gestures, but rather discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures weren&#39;t captured by the device&#39;s camera, but by a hand-worn wristband that recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- That&#39;s to say?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can?
You would do it with speech and with gestures.
- Usually, I only talk.
- Oh, that&#39;s going to be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt based on what the machine can or cannot do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
It can be for example laser sensors, they produce a fairly good depth resolution and this is very important.
- If we&#39;re interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what don&#39;t you like about modern cameras?
They lack resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we base our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be nice to get around 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but rather the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all the current technologies are quite good, it adds work to the designers of algorithms.
You have to keep in mind the resolution along the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c / s is really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche from our Redmond lab has given sensors touch a regular processing delay of between 1 and 100 µs, with current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would really need a device of this type in my work, but not requiring touch, to have more frames per second.
- But shouldn&#39;t the number of cameras be increased?
- The Kinect now has three &quot;cameras&quot;, one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a regular visible field sensor.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to the Kinect, to play with the curve of the cameras and see how that could help define the locations.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not introduce its glasses to the public.
Don&#39;t you think that from the point of view of daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the platforms with the most prospects?
- Of course, walking around all the time with a smartphone with your hands up is not practical, but here&#39;s what I think: the best option would be a &quot;transitional&quot; augmented reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass glasses to smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and that is their strength (the personal elements are the ones you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the augmented reality from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let&#39;s imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to ordinary mortals.
There is one problem that opponents of this idea point their finger at: there is no tactile sensation!
Hands feel nothing!
What responses is your group preparing to this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
At the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to act as an image carrier.
It registers the pressures perfectly!
But there are also technologies which are really intended to give palpability to these &quot;images in the air&quot;: for example the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a precise point where the finger is and which gives you the sensation, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the tips of the fingers.
There are also the bracelets worn on the wrists which influence the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a line of work presenting perspectives.
- And you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That&#39;s a good idea, we haven&#39;t tried it yet.
There is still a task below which we will have to work hard for a long time yet: how to make someone who is physically in a very small space believe that he is walking in an almost infinite open space - we working on the concepts of treadmills (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For the moment, we can only moderately deceive the brain, there are still many years of work.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in an absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste, not culture - Rosbalt.ru
&quot;Rosbalt&quot; continues the project &quot;Petersburg avant-garde&quot; dedicated to city dwellers who are ahead, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed eminent actors from the Saint Petersburg art scene whose achievements go beyond the city&#39;s border and who have found recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia. .
The new hero of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is the extroverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, dressed all in red who can be seen near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even at trendy parties and openings.
Kirill Miller&#39;s paintings always bring crowds together, wherever they are exhibited.
He is one of the fundamentally social and philosophical St. Petersburg storytellers, one of the founders of new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
He is also the symbol of the city, his appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took in his hands a barrel organ and he became the symbol of this instrument in Saint-Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role by his existence, his philosophy and his bohemian image.
- Kirill, why do you walk around the city all in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a designer specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image maker and society.
Even if in society everything that is not gray arouses aggression and negative restlessness.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize that you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my works were.
I understood that it was my way.
So, the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free ones, like me, were misunderstood.
I started to make friends with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevshchina which gave birth to &quot;Pushinskaya-10&quot; and then there was no more wave.
I&#39;m interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
- And all that ended up in your Art Clinic... - It was important for me to be at the center of culture in Saint Petersburg, where the best creative forces must meet.
In 1995, I took a seat at Pouchkinskaya-10, which before the works housed a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of bohemian Petersburg.
Many were born there: The NOMs, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arriving with the &quot;Van Gogh&#39;s ear&quot; project.
Chnour and his friends sang easy songs in lip-synching in tight-fitting swimsuits, among them Igor Vdovin, a composer who is now in fashion.
When the band started performing live, it became &quot;Leningrad&quot;.
Trakhtenberg hosted quite a few shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and that&#39;s when his great career began, but his basic training and education was where he got it.
Gallery &quot;D137&quot;, Club &quot;Griboyedov&quot;: these are repercussions of the Art Clinic.
Our employees went there as regulars.
I&#39;m a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, a poll was organized in the press: it was the prize &quot;The personalities of our city&quot;.
I was named &quot;Painter of the Year&quot;, and that&#39;s when my reign came to an end.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of truth, honesty and the culture of the past century.
Today it&#39;s easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong timeliness and acuity.
I&#39;m going to have a scheduled exhibition &quot;The Russian Museum through Clowns&quot;.
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it&#39;s scary to be like this.
But with the clowns, everything is erased, tragedy falls.
I like the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world via total and obligatory disguise.
Today, it is the clothes that matter, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can&#39;t give him a hand, but rather spit in his face.
And the lie will be erased by the disguise.
- Recently we saw you in the role of barrel organ player. - A cultural city must have this type of hero.
Who else but me can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today the commercial art must be neat, delicate, syrupy.
A disintegration of culture is occurring.
Before, people were divided into herds, bohemians liked one thing, fools another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it&#39;s difficult to please everyone.
I&#39;m not a hundred dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you are going to please.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It&#39;s people we&#39;ve dumped who come to see it, it&#39;s the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 thousand will not come and in the end it&#39;s less management, less money, everything withers.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted pictures that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings which are usually those that are painted at the end of their life.
Today, we often confuse ideas.
We say: there is spiritual culture, consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money precisely for painting.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, what is missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the culture official.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the rule of the good czars, it was not like that, the czars did not understand the culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow today there are good consultants.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who might be experts, but they are being pushed aside, because higher experts are needed who will properly assess these experts and clear a path for them.
Currently, it is the &quot;reign of taste&quot; that is flourishing.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they honestly say that they don&#39;t take all contemporary art, that there are painters who have to find other museums.
- For you, what is Saint-Petersburg?
- Saint-Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is soil for that.
And on our stones, art struggles to grow.
We need cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, that&#39;s bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who go to see exhibitions and concerts.
With us, this layer is very thin.
We must make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project realized with the support of the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange
Give birth in space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a murderous asteroid.
Caravans of space shuttles with earthlings on board go in search of a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how to continue to make our species live in weightlessness or even on a rescue planet?
I don&#39;t think there is much choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, if only hypothetically.
&quot;It&#39;s Venus and Mars,&quot; said Vladimir Sourdin, a researcher at the PK Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500 .
You can only live there at very high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus...in space.
We began to take an interest in questions of reproduction in space, focusing on the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of orbit-grown peas were in no way different from earth varieties.
Then we put insects into orbit, small reproductive Drosophila flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo developed in weightlessness.
We get a completely normal chick at the exit.
Then the problems start.
&quot;The problem is that the chick needs to find support, it needs to get on its feet and start moving,&quot; says the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medico-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
Finding no support, the chicks fidgeted haphazardly.
And after 10 hours, newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
&quot;We stared at them twice, then gave up, because it&#39;s just impossible to work with them there,&quot; says Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space. .
The last biological &quot;miniature ark&quot; with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the &quot;Bion&quot; biosatellite will only carry species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetuses into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
&quot;It was still about biosatellites and then it&#39;s the only experience. This kind of research must be carried out&quot;, points out Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
Nevertheless, it is not yet possible to make reproductions directly in space.
This is not an easy task.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instinct.
Unlike beasts, man is capable of this, in principle.
Homo sapiens possesses abstract thinking, he is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experiment is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been going into space for 50 years already.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has most precious.
Our seagull flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold up after a spaceflight.
If she could have given birth to a child after the theft.
“No one answered this question,” explains Vakhtang Vachnadze, retired from the rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a baby girl.
The child&#39;s father, Andrian Nikolayev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, having been twice in orbit and even having worked in the extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to healthy offspring after long flights.
“And if they are longer, it poses a danger even during orbital flights,” concludes pilot and cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
However, humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnologies, protection against radiation and the creation of artificial gravitation.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Center: obligatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero buoyancy, cosmonauts train for spacewalks.
Water imitates weightlessness.
If for adults water is comfortable but nevertheless a foreign environment, for infants it is their true element.
The little amphibious men seem to confirm it: life on Earth originated in the ocean.
Insofar as the baby develops around 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of the mother&#39;s womb, it is then easier for him to get used to water.
This is logical in principle, because from birth to his first bath, only 2 weeks pass.
&quot;It&#39;s very little to forget,&quot; says infant swim instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the belly, the pelvis atrophy very quickly, the baby&#39;s ability to push is lost.
Alright, let&#39;s ignore that by relying on childbirth simulators.
We can of course prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will manage to get him out.
&quot; After that?&quot; asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite reflection on this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the earth&#39;s attraction, the organism does not form the skeleton or the muscular system.
You cannot dress an infant like an adult with a special suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
&quot;And this experience that we would envision in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a handicapped child, completely maladjusted&quot;, foresees the Director of the committee for bioethics of the Institute of medico-biological problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still theoretical.
However, in time this will become a reality as Earthlings travel in their shuttles to a distant planet which will become the habitat of their spaceborn offspring.
The head of the SAI (Supreme Audit Institution) said: “The control of pseudo self-employment (in Czech “Švarc system”) has failed because of politicians.
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and good legislation, but it lags behind in its application.
This was stated by Miloslav Kala, Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Audit Institution in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
&quot;The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, this is what is lacking in our country,&quot; Kala said in his commentary on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice the &quot;Švarc system&quot; approach by Petr Nečas.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS was not going to bother contractors with checks; so is it allowed or forbidden?
&quot;The law must be enforced one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from going to inspect to demand compliance with the law. “, observes Kala.
During the meeting of the control commission at the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-German project within the framework of which the legislation on public procurement in these two countries was compared.
What was it about concretely?
This is a parallel control that we started about two years ago.
In simple terms, EU law sets out how public procurement should be handled, and specific national laws and practice follow.
We have put all this together and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, some very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps &quot;tougher and better&quot;, nevertheless, according to certain parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This therefore confirms that it is not enough to continually develop more and more detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote oneself to the actual application of the law.
How can this project help you concretely and what does it mean for you?
A common control of this type should precisely help us to stop trying to clarify the laws, to lower and improve the thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtaining the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the market thresholds, we will not necessarily achieve this objective.
It could be that this system is so overwhelmed with paperwork that those looking for loopholes will find many more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You talk about internal problems concerning the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our SAI or a different mode of organization?
As far as institutions are concerned, like the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof works there, which is organized similarly, it also has a council constituted a little differently, but these two institutions basically operate in a similar way.
The competences are also, to a certain extent, similar, with one nuance, however, in relation to our system: Germany being a federal structure, it therefore also has courts of auditors of this type at the level of the various Länder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which in our country corresponds to state resources.
The public funds managed here by the regions and municipalities are controlled there by the courts of auditors of the Länder.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, nevertheless, in certain areas, Germany is often pointed out as a model but we cannot surely say that it does better in all areas.
Maybe it&#39;s because they have better inspectors?
No, definitely not, but again, I don&#39;t have any comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country that we consider as a model is also facing a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage in cooperating with our institution, right?
With regard to national legislation, what has the amendment of the law on public procurement meant for you as an institution, are its effects already being felt?
As this amendment entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we carry out checks a posteriori, it is necessary to count with a certain delay.
Our observations relate only, for the moment, to the process of preparing for future controls - we have launched a new instrument for &quot;detection of the risks of mismanagement&quot; with which we have screened almost 14,000 public contracts - there these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed as well as the conditions for certain types of tendering procedures and so on.
So do you consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that can arise is that these rules become more severe and it is not possible to respect them.
Already under the previous regulations, the service provider (for example the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced the subjects audited to accept that any violation of the law on contracts means a breach of budgetary discipline.
So is it really useful to make the law tougher in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse it, but not punish those who make formal errors that have no consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Let&#39;s see where we&#39;re not going.
Recently, the prime minister said that the ODS is not going to bother entrepreneurs with checks from the so-called Švarc system - what does this mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be enforced one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from going to inspect and demand compliance with the law. .
He can say, &quot;We&#39;re going to change the law and allow it,&quot; but he can&#39;t say we&#39;re going to act like nothing happened.
The procurement law includes relatively strict rules on the formalities to be completed, precisely in order to protect the call for tenders.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that, in my opinion, is what is lacking here.
The roads are frozen in places, but most remain passable.
In some places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snowy.
However, the network remains for the most part practicable, in certain places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary region
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were passable this morning, but in places frozen and also snowy.
Temperatures have dropped and fluctuate between -5° and -10° C but they should rise slightly during the day.
Snowfall has ceased in the region and only a light dusting of snow remains on the plains.
The ridges of the Ore Mountains (Krušné hory) are however covered with about 30 centimeters of snow.
Data from the regional road maintenance service show that due to the fog, visibility was reduced in places.
The R6 expressway and the national roads of the region are now passable without difficulty.
However, vigilance is still required, for example on certain bridges where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
All county roads and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
There are still remnants of frozen snow on some of their sections and in places packed down by traffic.
Especially in areas located at high altitudes, drivers must increase their vigilance.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové regions
The Directorate of Roads and Motorways reports on its website that some roads in East Bohemia are threatened by the formation of ice and that layers of snow packed down by traffic may be on the roads in mountainous areas and located in altitude.
Road maintenance services warn drivers about the risk of ice formation in areas of the Pardubice region located at high altitudes.
There may be black ice in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on county and third-category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy have been chemically treated.
Snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of snow packed by traffic is present on the roads in areas located at higher altitudes.
In Eastern Bohemia, the weather will be dry today, mostly clear, with possible cloudy periods.
It will blow a weak wind and the temperatures will generally fluctuate between -3° and + 1° C.
Pilsen region
The roads in the Pilsen region are passable today, although in places you need to be extra vigilant and adapt your driving to the weather conditions.
It is freezing this morning, temperatures fluctuate between -3° and -9°C.
After the last snowfalls and the cooling that followed, some communication routes may be frozen in places.
Drivers can expect to pass through areas of fog, however visibility will gradually improve.
This is according to information from the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 motorway is passable almost without difficulty, however the road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between kilometers 80 and 131.
The surface of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections may be frozen in the Pilsen-South district and in the Tachov district.
The departmental and third category roads are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers should be vigilant, especially on the less busy roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc region
Drivers traveling to areas of the Olomouc region located at high altitude must now reckon with a layer of thick, soft snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the so-called &quot;Červenohorské sedlo&quot; pass and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after the chemical treatment operations.
Snowfall forced road maintenance personnel into the field that night; according to the services in charge of roads, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of Šumperk.
In the other parts of the region, most roads are passable without difficulty.
“On the heights of the Šumperk district there are remnants of snow.
Drivers traveling in the direction of Jeseník should expect to encounter at the so-called &quot;Červenohorské sedlo pass&quot; a thick, soft layer of snow&quot;, the head of the road maintenance services of the Šumperk district told ČTK today.
Their colleagues from the Jeseník district also went there during the night; according to them, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are passable without difficulty, in the district of Šternberk the drivers should however be careful in the sections in forest zones with roadways remained wet.
Ústí nad Labem and Liberec regions
As early as this morning, the North Bohemian road maintenance services reported several difficult sections.
According to police data, in addition to some places covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, so snow and ice should persist on the roads. In the plains, especially in the south east of the Central Bohemian Plateau, there are, on the contrary, no problems and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at this time.
The road maintenance services have reported the presence of ice, especially around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, nighttime conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snowmelt during the day, clear skies and frost overnight.
Difficult conditions are also reported from the main traffic axes on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to tree branches that bent under the weight of the snow until they reached the roadway.
Šimon Ornest said: &quot;In concert, we want to collect positive energy.&quot;
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
This is just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, we rather laugh about it and we say to ourselves that we are the only group capable of collecting a rest of positive energy in order to postpone or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you are putting together a very unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
It is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years already.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 am.
The day before, December 20, three concerts will take place simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end almost at the end of the Mayan calendar on the island of Kiribati, which is in the Pacific Ocean, on a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who had this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together with the public to reflect on the state of the world that we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a collection of unique objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by purchasing them online at www.e -tap.cz people can also support us.
The group The Tap Tap with other performers has also recorded a hymn against the end of the world which is called &quot;End of the world cancelled&quot; (in Czech &quot;Konec světa zrušeno&quot;).
She is already very popular on YouTube, will we also hear her during these charity concerts?
Of course, at the very end, well, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in the three concerts.
The anthems will also come together at some point in a very unique live broadcast on Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also plays the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings there...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other Czech showbiz personalities, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charity events...
We strive to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and enjoy it.
What will the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world be used for?
To equip the Studeo training center which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on within the framework of the Jedlička institute, with the Tap association, and that for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedličkův Institute and offer them activities that interest and amuse them.
The students themselves cannot afford to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Several music groups and performers will take the stage during each of these concerts?
According to what criteria did you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program that speaks to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will take the stage.
Full details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other such &quot;mega events&quot; in the future?
In May we will play for the first time as part of the Prague Spring; there too, we will surely prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year in the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once there in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group made up of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It&#39;s not as terrible as it looks at first glance.
We have five members in electric wheelchairs whose machines have to travel in the hold, naturally we also carry around a lot of luggage and boxes of instruments....
So far everything has more or less always gone well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to your travels abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of ease of access for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of public opinion towards people with disabilities and so on. right now.
What have your experiences been so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that in the east everything is still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very inaccessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for a person to travel alone in an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider it obvious to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association trying to draw attention to the problems of disabled people is being created.
How do we still have to catch up with more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we are still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and refinements always depend on the efforts made by the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move about alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It&#39;s not very common over there that a large number of disabled people actively participate in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather on the contrary at the forefront of progress!
Public respect and ease of access are one thing, but the situation will really begin to change when we have among us famous sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers.
At the moment, these are just isolated cases of people who are strong-willed.
The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, let&#39;s go back a few years, what pushed you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by a lot of young people ready to get involved in something.
And since I am a musician myself (I play the saxophone, among other things), with a colleague, we have created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, we lost control of the situation a bit (laughs).
Success only happened in the last few years, if I&#39;m not mistaken?
It&#39;s true, bonding with well-known singers and actively working to promote the band has helped us.
We have understood that, if a work is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to subsidies from the European Union, we can also afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
Right from the start, I felt there was potential to change things.
Show business is full of tricks that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
Original projects are rare, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it&#39;s natural...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by everyone, whom we should pity.
These are people who can live a full life and flourish, provided they have the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities manage to achieve something, it&#39;s not only a step forward for them but for the whole society.
Isn&#39;t your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be intransigent in many areas and demand a certain discipline.
But I think it&#39;s completely normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and their heads in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the road for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The group The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
Only one, Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group, people come and go, there&#39;s nothing we can do about it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case the day before the day scheduled for the end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, in Brno in Fléda and in Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when the song of the group The Tap Tap &quot;End of the world cancelled&quot; will be sung together.
The purpose of the concert is to gather financial means (to the tune of 25 million CZK) to equip the multifunctional training center Studeo which is located in Prague in the Jedlička institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years old, presale of tickets is open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, during the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of this agency, it is the second member state of the former Eastern bloc (the Republic Czech became a full member on November 12, 2008).
Poland entered into close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and over the following years participated in a number of the agency&#39;s projects.
Poland&#39;s road to space, however, began much earlier.
Already before the Second World War, passionate Poles worked on space flights; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, A. Šternfeld&#39;s lecture at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on December 6, 1933, during which he presented ideas taken from his avant-garde work entitled &quot;Introduction to Astronautics&quot;.
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left listeners cold and years later Šternfeld remembered that only doctor Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld obtained in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize for his work &quot;Introduction to astronautics&quot;.
The said doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) subsequently became a great propagator of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote numerous books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a world-famous propagator of astronautics, his contribution was notably rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the far side of the Moon.
As early as 1925, a handcar was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the rocket was to be used to propel or brake the draisine.
The only known information on this draisine is that of the press of the time.
From 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was carried out by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia institute in collaboration with professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It appears from the documents preserved that this research had reached the trial stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the research was interrupted.
In 1937, plans for a photoelectric fighter rocket, drawn by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press, and the following year the work &quot;Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza&quot; by an author named Leliwy was published. -Krzywoblocki.
These two projects were aimed at the military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of rocket technology were carried out by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (&quot;Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy&quot;), which coordinated all work.
This committee had been created in 1937, but after two years of operation, the outbreak of the war put an end to its activities.
After the war, other works devoted to aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, a company is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the newspaper Problem, in which there are four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to astronautics
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the International Astronautical Federation (established in 1951) and by autumn the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the international astronautical federation.
He retained his position until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters was 80 cm long and weighed just under 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version, RM-1A, was built and, during the summer of 1959, flight tests of the RM-2 two-stage rocket were started in the Bledov desert.
This rocket was 1.4 meters long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been capable of carrying out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have had a range of up to 14.5 km and served for observing the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded the first rockets of the RM type.
This rocket, designed with two stages, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (designated Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space with a volume of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liters, and in Meteor-1C - 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these types of craft was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a 10 kg payload to an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland&#39;s entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Within the framework of the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites, and in 1978 pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut in this program.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Utility Works Act.
This decision aroused a lively discussion in public opinion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to examine this problem from a broader point of view.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means concretely that the different economic entities as well as the national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.
This results from the principle of free trade and the free circulation (without limits) of private capital combined with unbridled financial speculation.
Considerable differences in the price of labor (wages) generate pressure on prices.
This term should have the following meaning: a producer endeavors by importing goods sold at a low price to resist economic competition by &quot;making the competitor&#39;s price more expensive&quot;, with the aim of removing a greater share of the market and thus increase its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either moving production abroad, or buying cheap, or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in countries where labor prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the social charges of the state necessarily increase.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of gentlemen entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is so common knowledge that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create in the different economies a situation in which the governments of the different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without regard to social collapse.
This manifests itself mainly in the amendments of the laws in force.
The objective is to force its own population economically to accept the diktat of the prices of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This occurs on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and on the other hand by the restriction of the rights of employees in the field of labor legislation.
The result is growing poverty and the deepening of the differences between rich and poor.
In the FRG, for years there have been public food distribution points for the poor who cannot support themselves with their own labour.
There are already millions of such people.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is becoming quite common for employees to receive such wages that the state is forced to pay a supplement for them to reach the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal has, for example, been brought to light in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
The economy measures of virtually all southern EU Member States are undoubtedly generating a similar situation in which, under the pressure of catastrophic societal breakdown, people are forced either to emigrate ( as was the case in the 19th century), or to scrape by on starvation wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their country.
The following question must be asked here: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or else a Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also concerns all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media claim, wearily, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the command economy leads to economic catastrophe.
Private capital fiercely defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
We must then ask ourselves whether private capital does not influence and even direct today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and, by the same token, the entire state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The proof is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby present in all states.
The result is a hopeless situation manifesting itself in the field of corruption, by the granting of mutual advantages, in the legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In the FRG, the situation is such that, due to a lack of financial means, the national ministries delegate the drafting of bills to law firms closely linked to the industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people, as Western-style constitutions declare, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is obvious that the democracies oriented towards liberalism are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his work entitled &quot;the crisis of the Roman Empire in the time of Caesar and Pompey&quot;: &quot;The State had long been in full decay and the functions were attributed by violence.
Kickbacks, illegally obtained favors, and stones and swords were also used to secure these positions.
Kickbacks and corruption proliferated without limit and the people went to the elections with votes already sold &quot;... ... &quot; Honest people did not seek any office, it resulted once that the State remained 8 months without consuls&quot;.... &#39; People really began to say that the remedy for this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man&quot;... It is true that Appianos had to Pompey&#39;s spirit, but it was Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into an absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, today&#39;s society is based on the preference for personal profit, without regard for the interest of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and advance the interests of society as a whole.
The result, today as in the past, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, without any effort to carry out in-depth reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of things, we can consider the disappearance of these systems in favor of liberal-type democracies as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human life, the humanitarian and social crises that we are witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally and internally in Europe, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to lower the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution is sociopolitical reforms that will strengthen state capital investment in the economy, increase citizens&#39; influence over government, and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society to the benefit of society. &#39;State.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
&quot;Nothing will ever come out of violence and never can&quot; declares Sting in the song entitled Fragile whose main chorus line is &quot;let&#39;s not forget how fragile we are&quot;.
&quot;If my sons didn&#39;t want wars, there wouldn&#39;t be any,&quot; said Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have arisen.
Some take the side of Israel, arguing its right to self-defense and casting the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel a terrorist state.
I don&#39;t want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is victim, in its waves of recurring killings; all in all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born into the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view &quot;behind the curtain&quot;, on who mainly benefits from the tensions that have already persisted for more than 95 years (from the Balfour declaration in 1917) in a small piece of country in the Middle -East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available for study, others emerge from my own understanding of who, or more exactly of the group of individuals, who is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
In each era, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individualities acted independently or if they owed their actions to the throne by someone who directed their actions according to previously defined goals.
We have to admit that we live in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration engendering certain powers could not be achieved in a single generation.
Among the families possessing astronomical wealth, the Rothschild family particularly stands out, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I don&#39;t know if these families still have a leader, but I don&#39;t rule it out).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
As early as the 90s of the 19th century, they acquired the world&#39;s leading news agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the links between their name and serious criminal acts in which they were involved and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their wealth or both.
They have major stakes in almost most of the world&#39;s central banks and prepare or wage wars against countries in which they do not yet have such stakes (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of such countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq by 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only by 4, in the meantime Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild&#39;s Bank of America as a central bank and began issuing his own (government, I mean) money during the Civil War and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
JFK started issuing clean money and wanted to dissolve the FED, he was assassinated in 1963, Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to sue the FED for starting the Great Depression of 1929.
Their lust for world power led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan for three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated at the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war was to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to suppress colonialism, especially British, and the third was to reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), to create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the beginning of such a solution) and, in the end, to acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families, headed by the Rothschilds, is to create a crisis and then to propose a solution (order ab chaos - order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to an aggravation of the situation (see the creation of the FED intended to prevent the repetition of crises like those which they provoked in 1907).
After having succeeded in triggering the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers let the politicians create a situation of latent conflict: they, on the one hand, imposed huge war reparations on Germany, thus generating the conditions for a radicalization impoverished masses (then they just need to place a sufficiently energetic leader, pointing the finger at the culprits, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who was to play the role (which she effectively held) of the fifth column to set fire to the powder and start a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschields inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (back to Zion) .
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for a mass emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
World War II broke out; it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had initially held him; or if everything he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps laid the groundwork for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; just as the war reparations imposed on Germany started World War II, so the founding of the State of Israel sparked a fire that could lead to World War III.
If the international bankers manage to trigger this war, the Jewish population will be, as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time along with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but internationally (just see how people are bitterly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one wrong begets another wrong in an endless circle of violence and where, at the root of everything, there are individuals&#39; greed and their desire to gain power over the whole world?
It is necessary here to make the difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because like at home, the international bankers only propose to people in the elections their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascistic politician, loyal to international bankers, who is doing everything to start a war with Iran, which could, because of that country&#39;s adherence to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) expand to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz through which 20% of all world oil (this naval corridor is only 2 miles wide) and wreak havoc on the world economy.
In what light now appear the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: &quot;The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.&quot;
In their view, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of financial aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every new born is implanted at birth with an electronic chip making him a totally controlled being.
“Let them compel all individuals, small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves, to wear a brand on their hands or foreheads, so that they cannot buy or sell anyone who does not wear the mark. name of this ferocious beast or the cipher of its name.
It should be understood: that whoever has common sense counts the numbers of this ferocious beast.
This number designates the man and it is six hundred and sixty six.&quot;
The Argo Movie: When It&#39;s Bad, Call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrators made up of Islamist students stormed the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who after the revolution had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the American administration a positive outcome, it could not, indeed, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was unable to obtain the release of the hostages.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, a blow made worse later by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their plight sparked an outpouring of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian debacle was a major contributor to Jimmy Carter&#39;s defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode in this history that offered a small victory for America.
Just before it was occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated adventures, they found themselves in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran thanks to an incredible cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a film crew who had come to scout locations for the filming of a sci-fi spectacle film.
Combination of genres
Exfiltration expert Tony Mendez&#39;s plan required Hollywood collaboration.
In order to make the legend more believable, specialized magazines reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictitious production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck&#39;s film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is partly a realistic political thriller, but also a &quot;caper movie&quot;, the story of a successful coup, a treachery - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean&#39;s eleven, twelve and thirteen.
The atmospheres follow one another: sequences of Tehran in documentary style (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs from the time of the events and the way in which, thanks to these photos, these same situations were transcribed in the film, there are no big differences),
lighter passages from Hollywood, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration,
and then scenes of CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in hallways and on the telephone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
From a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his acting ceased to elicit ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark detective &quot;Gone Baby Gone&quot; (2007) and the thriller &quot;The town&quot; (2010).
It is also Affleck&#39;s first film not set in his hometown of Boston.
A sense of the atmosphere of a location is one of the characteristics that set his early films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where Tehran&#39;s role is &quot;held&quot; by Canada.
The film&#39;s best scenes take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real events; the opening sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also suggests the confusion and unpredictability that occurs when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the fake film crew in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to make do with a subject that actually offered few thrilling scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
He comes out of it very well, he sometimes adds certain elements to reality and there, the result is not always so elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is averted by a phone call in America and the chase on the airstrip are pretty far-fetched).
Argo&#39;s weakness lies in its dissipated nature, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role of Hollywood co-operators, their characters deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from it, the only ones in this case.
Affleck&#39;s film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, it lets itself be seen with moderate interest, enjoying the direction and the retro style of the 70s.
He leads the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story still, in some ways, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the portrayal of the Secret Service as omnipotent and omniscient, it does the trick.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually conducts a public survey on the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch a competition for the most absurd regulations or ideas from the &quot;EU workshop&quot; .
&quot;The fact that the EU recently considered adopting a 40 percent quota for women in the management of large European companies was the reason for our decision,&quot; said the newspaper Právo l organizer of this survey, Patrik Nacher.
Among the absurdities mentioned there is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, however, women have had an advantage in terms of life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such amazing idea of &quot;EU workshop&quot;.
“The vote will take place before the end of February 2013,” Nacher informed.
Among the controversial EU regulations are, for example, the obligation to add bio-components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of hen cages, which has led to an increase in the price of eggs.
Criticism has also been leveled in the past against the de facto ban on the use of the term &quot;spreadable butter&quot; or the removal of conventional light bulbs from sale.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters in size.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (thus the Czech Republic currently imposes the demands of its banks by threatening to use his right of veto).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, behind the fact that in the Union bananas must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an &quot;abnormal curvature&quot;.
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was only harmonizing non-homogeneous national standards which complicated trade.
Fruit and vegetable standards have been relaxed despite opposition from some states, claiming the existing guidelines result in food waste.
Perhaps the top prize in this survey will go to last year&#39;s EU regulation that inflatable balls must bear a warning that children under the age of 8 should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU referred to a US survey that found balloons to be the number one cause of child suffocation deaths among toys.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 when it comes to blowing fairground trumpets.
We also have bizarre ideas.
The following rule concerning European civil servants themselves is quite absurd: due to the sensitivity of this topic for Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name &quot;Macedonia&quot; and must, instead, talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the &quot;Laissez Faire&quot; association of liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com has named in this investigation, in addition to some nonsense mentioned above, the Union&#39;s regulation regarding the volume of food reserves on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for the reserves of food products that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and risked a heavy fine as a result.
The organizers of this survey considered the idea of paying sums of money to certain countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy to request the granting of subsidies.
These ideas, however, did not originate in Brussels but in Prague.
“The fact of not having sea handicaps us.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund&quot;. Thus expressed, in the autumn of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture at the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He argued that, because of our wheat production, and following the so-called &quot;interventionist&quot; purchases, the State had found itself with full stocks which it had then had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and organized a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Subsidies for obtaining subsidies were offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), these were, in concrete terms, to be used to write applications for subsidies granted by Brussels.
The EU says: &quot;weird regulations are rare&quot;.
While regulations often arouse criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the efforts made by the EU in terms of regulation and improving the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union as well as in the field of its development general, rather deserve praise.
More serious is, for example, according to the experts, the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects which have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States during budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries in the Union, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (a fight from which it does not always emerge victorious) arouses strong feelings among the Czechs.
If after six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name &quot;Olomoucké tvarůžky&quot;, as for the name &quot;Tuzemský rum&quot; which dates back to us in the 19th century, our producers have had to replace it with the name &quot;Tuzemák&quot;.
Only products based on cane sugar alcohol, and not based on beet sugar, can bear the name of rum.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, one finds today, together with world-famous cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham, biscuits from Karlovy Vary (&quot;Karlovarské suchary&quot; ), carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň (&quot;Pohořelický a Třeboňský kapr&quot;) and hops from Žatec (&quot;Žatecký chmel&quot;).
Pardubice gingerbread (&quot;Pardubický perník&quot;) and cakes called &quot;Cornets de Hořice&quot; (&quot;hořické trubičky&quot;) can also be proud of their community trademark.
People want me to save the Republic, but I&#39;m just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Senator, how does one get the idea of standing for the presidential elections?
It&#39;s not being a senator or president that matters to me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I wouldn&#39;t be a candidate anywhere.
But I can&#39;t bear to see how the country has been plundered for the past twenty years, that the thieves are not locked up and the taxes and the retirement age are increasing.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don&#39;t like, then I try to bring a solution to change it.
And as I am over forty years old and I am independent, member of no party, I have no other solution to influence the situation than to present myself in the presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate but quickly made your way to the Castle.
Are you not thus turning your back on those who elected you?
I have always said that I will fight for the Castle according to the results of the senatorial elections.
Subsequently, I specified that if I were elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not the function, this one is only an instrument allowing me to realize my vision.
This is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we groan at the bar or in front of our television sets, but it is also that we trample on those who try to bring about change.
Added to this is the press, which destroys people&#39;s reputations and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
It has, for example, been said about me that I bribe journalists or that I was Jiří Paroubek&#39;s adviser.
Let&#39;s come to your visions.
You started the fight for the Castle with the themes of the material and criminal liability of politicians and retroactive tax declarations over twenty million [CZK] as your main concern.
To do this you must change the law.
As president, you have no such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I pushed for the activities of tourist guide to constitute a liberal profession, I won my case.
The problem is politics: when someone arrives from the left or the right with a good project, it is knowingly refused and that delays the citizens.
As an independent, a member of no party, I have a much better chance of obtaining the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and partisan dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you consider yourself more of a right-winger or a left-winger?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people put me on the left.
For me, whether it&#39;s a little left or right, it doesn&#39;t really matter.
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
What matters to me is not whether people are left or right, but bringing people together.
I always support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I act just as impartially against bad ideas.
Do you get mad when someone calls you a populist?
But doesn&#39;t what you said prove it?
When you make a business plan in a business, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision.
You try to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I&#39;m talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken about them.
But without the support of parliament, you are left with only slogans.
You won&#39;t survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my camp in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and penal responsibility of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they do not want it.
When there is a strong personality who will identify the abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take for example the election of the president by direct suffrage, it was obtained thanks to the pressure of public opinion.
I admit, bluntly, to being an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my opinions and my visions.
I have just entered politics and I am trying to obtain the support of the majority for my program.
I try, on my own, to get things done, and if that doesn&#39;t work, I&#39;ll quit in six years and go back to the private sector.
It&#39;s a bit like Okamura had to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a saviour.
I know that a single person cannot make the difference, that is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to also present themselves in the senatorial elections.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused due to the amount of work.
At least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who exposed the fuel oil frauds.
I showed up because people are really upset but now I&#39;m hesitating.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and those who did did, for the most part, gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
The people elected a Senate that will find it difficult to impose changes.
Despite everything, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and regional prefects.
Do you plan to found your own party?
No, not yet, because I don&#39;t have the time to check if each potential member&#39;s past is spotless and then I don&#39;t have the financial means.
I don&#39;t have any money for my presidential campaign either, I only have twenty thousand in my &quot;transparent&quot; account.
Don&#39;t have any money?
You talk about tax returns, what is yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property at around 60 million.
I have land in Prague worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a childhood dream: I always loved James Bond, who drove cars, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have a heritage worth 60 million and you have no money for your campaign?
Want to change the Republic but don&#39;t want to invest your own money in it?
It&#39;s not very convincing.
I don&#39;t have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I go into debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my program does not arouse much interest.
I don&#39;t have to pay for this campaign out of my own pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn&#39;t live on it, for example paying for my son&#39;s English school which costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I wouldn&#39;t run for office.
So you are going to continue your commercial activities in order to be able to live?
Didn&#39;t you say you would put your activities on hold?
But this is not linked to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take over the management of the travel agency in the spring.
People want me to be a Samaritan saving the Republic.
However, I have to live on something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business activities.
You will find this interview in the Saturday edition of the Práva newspaper.
The architects of the MVRDV firm prove that real adventures are not only a matter of imagination. To be convinced of this, just look at Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
&quot;I think this building is funny, it looks very futuristic, finally something interesting to see&quot;, says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist in a large neighboring company, tells us: &quot;Yes, it is indeed very beautiful, this building&quot;.
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one goes voluntarily into one of those old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, an unattractive bedroom community on the outskirts of Rotterdam, holds a rather peculiar record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to give back some neurons to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges which appear on the euro banknotes in the form of pretty little miniatures in reinforced concrete painted.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to regain control of the statistics: building a library!
Winy Maas, of the Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, a master of bold bar diagrams and creator of witty and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual composure and entered the competition in 2003 with five books under the arms and a sneer on his face.
And while the members of the jury still looked at each other, bewildered and shrugging their shoulders, Maas, the cheeky one, piled his books of choice in order of size to make a pyramid, and ended his speech supported by activist arguments with a: &quot;dear commune!&quot;
Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as we say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros has sprung up from the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and terraced houses for a total of 50 dwellings.
At the beginning of November, the mountain of books received the second prize &quot;Best Library of NL 2012&quot;.
Furthermore, the project was shortlisted for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is how this dull little town, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a bewilderingly ugly town hall, whose white facades invite you to think that they house a dairy, has been enriched with a contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long road to reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese cover.
Admittedly, an elevator transports you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open up to you when you set foot on the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The all-glass interior is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and elegant lampposts speak unequivocally the language of municipal plazas.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for public benches, dogs and little boys and girls playing ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally, the library shelves are along the front and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,” explains Willy Maas.
We have completely upset the classic spatial configuration and opened up the reading spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been skilfully arranged: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A special beauty lies in the black shelves of the library, which are sometimes paneling, sometimes balustrades, sometimes banisters.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even hardened architects and building engineers don&#39;t want unfamiliar materials.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, project manager with the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to Standard.
This is how one day we found in a Frisian agricultural company an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, one millimeter thick synthetic membrane has been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It&#39;s cheap and saves time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the &quot;Landbouwplastic&quot; (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes .
At the top of the 105 steps is the summit of the mountain.
After almost 500 meters, the literary café offers us a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and potted ficus.
The latter create an atmosphere, but above all they contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity in the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the New Soul
&quot;It&#39;s incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology,&quot; says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is under a glass bell jar, the sun only illuminates the interior for a short time, even on sunny days.
The thick wooden beams mounted at an angle to the glass facade serve as a sun shield, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The ambient atmosphere is very pleasant.
Fully automated awnings take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned skeptical computer scientist, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was also already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as &quot;the soul finally found&quot; of Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, during the inauguration, each citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure made it possible to fill the gaps in the library which was not yet fully stocked (today it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays overflow from all sides.
For architect Winy Maas, &quot;there is nothing worse than a half-empty library.&quot;
&quot;I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it&#39;s just for decoration.&quot;
This is how MVRDV reached the master discipline known in professional jargon as “creating an identity”.
Spijkenisse has written a new page in literary history.
Even though she may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: &quot;The Germans have to play a bigger role.&quot;
Germany chose to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to US-EU relations expert Stephen Szabo, the decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinians&#39; request for observer state status at the United Nations.
But she then chose abstention.
For what?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin should exercise caution, as it has a special relationship with Israel.
But I also think that she does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but without being overly critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen to abstain during the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is in the process of reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a so to speak American-defined policy and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans therefore came up against several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe they are still groping to find this role, but are on the way to a &quot;more normal&quot; foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Great Britain
So what does the term &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy actually mean for the Germans?
It shows the desire to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national issues.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests influence Germany&#39;s stance on the Middle East conflict and abstention in the UN vote?
Germany first has major outlets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
This is why Berlin must be careful not to offend public opinion, but also the elites of Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a determining factor.
However, I would not attach too much importance to it, because it is not an exclusively one-sided relationship.
But this is in any case a decisive element in German strategic thinking.
Is Germany harming its relations with the United States by choosing abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think the Europeans and the Americans fully understand the German position.
This is why I think the divide is not as serious as it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected for it.
Indeed, Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions regarding the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States announced its veto in a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the domestic American political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration is secretly showing great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot of course defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing with enthusiasm for Netanyahu&#39;s policies.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I think that does not make things easier for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today this is not the case.
They cannot therefore be part of a broader political line and must assert their unique position.
This is what they are currently doing in the question of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will take on a leading role in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
It&#39;s not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been tricky.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they have to play a role which marks more their independence.
Does Germany see itself as a strong player on the international scene, does Germany just want to take on a key role?
Or does she still struggle to take on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable for them and, for obvious reasons, the country still finds it difficult to play a bigger role.
If we look, for example, at the euro crisis, we notice that each time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
It doesn&#39;t make things any easier for the Germans.
In fact, it&#39;s always the same problem: we don&#39;t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
She has to deal with a wide variety of neighbors and opinions, and it&#39;s not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European politics is only diminishing, but right now the EU is not filling this void, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
And even if they don&#39;t like it, even if it&#39;s unpleasant for them and if they&#39;re only less appreciated, that&#39;s life!

&quot;Brand protection&quot; in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name hides a trademark officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trademark thus enjoys such protection that the company that bears the name cannot file a complaint.
And even if she could, it is not certain that she would succeed.
“It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing who specializes in infringement of property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
Impersonators only need a few extra letters to be able to register their marks.
So, instead of Gucci, we register Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we register Prada-Kny.
German companies are also being copied quite legally, such as Puma, the sporting goods manufacturer.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet containing the registrations made with the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm artificially created by appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping centers that sell practically only counterfeits.
Pattloch&#39;s cases are different, however: his principals task him with challenging the fact that China&#39;s trademark office formally grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of &quot;Bang Mingpai&quot;, a parent brand.
The term is derived from &quot;Bang Dakuan&quot;.
It is with this term that women who marry rich men are designated.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to be ashamed of.
&quot;It&#39;s bad for business, we have to fight against this trend,&quot; demands Pattloch.
&quot;The brand is watered down, the uniqueness disappears, the reputational damage is enormous.&quot;
Financial losses and legal costs are in the millions for the affected sectors, especially with regard to expensive flagships.
According to data from market analysis firm CLSA, China is the world&#39;s third-largest and fastest-growing luxury goods market with an annual volume of 15 billion euros.
However, it is not easy to remove questionable registrations from the Trademark Register and these procedures are expensive.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reports on the lawsuits in which the court dismissed the complaint, because after a long period the criticized name had become a &quot;market reality&quot;.
Pattloch explains to us that if the complainant is unlucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist, because he would have damaged his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just taken over concrete pump producer Putzmeister.
This is the reason why the Chinese can use an emblem resembling the Mercedes star.
Geely, the acquirer of Volvo, previously used a blue and white logo reminiscent of that of BMW. The conflict was settled and Geely had to modify it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost against plagiarists from Hong Kong and Singapore who had redirected the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The CTMO Trademark Office in Beijing admits, however, that it experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the office is said to have moved last year from an “emergency situation in the course of work to a newfound normality”.
Thus, the number of unprocessed opposition procedures would have decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases are reported to have been closed, representing a 75% increase over the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures remain pending at the office.
Acting is expensive
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, this is a record and it means that China is for the tenth consecutive time at the top of the ranking for the number of new filings in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office would have recorded 1.8 billion yuan of registration fees.
In other words, each recording earned an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg illustrates.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
True, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of vehicle components suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain his Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
&quot;It&#39;s our fault, because surnames cannot be protected in Germany,&quot; says Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The trademark office had therefore rejected the objection of the Munich residents.
Freudenberg certainly won his case with the two following bodies, but the opposing party continues to fight until today.
Vigilance is key
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praises the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: &quot;the procedure is long, trying and costs us a lot of time and money.&quot;
It is also difficult to assess the internal costs. The archives service even had to review the records of the last hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a &quot;large sum in six-figure euros&quot; to settle the dispute.
&quot;That&#39;s how we see what it means to us,&quot; says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to spill over into Europe.
This would be the case if imitators from this region ensured the exploitation of unprotected marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to register the Freudenberg name in Germany for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long since abandoned this sector, but was still able to prevent the filing.
Wentzler adds: &quot;vigilance is in order&quot;.
He and Pattloch advise German companies to exercise great caution in their business dealings with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to rely on international trademark law, rather foreigners should &quot;register also in China everything that is likely to be protected&quot;, as Wentzler puts it.
Otherwise, the costs can be much higher than the registration costs.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the final act of its legal drama, the company would have to pay licensing fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Otherwise, we would lose our place in the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: stomp, sing, help
The Imbongi choir is rehearsing in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland are delighted to have them come.
This is the story of a link that spans far more than 8.733 kilometres.
First, we tap our feet: cowboy boots, sneakers, pumps for ladies and moccasins for men seek rhythm by tapping the ground with their feet. Soon they find him.
One two three four.
Then, the voices of the singers grow slowly - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they get carried away, bewitch and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses his canvas shoes when he directs the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
It&#39;s Monday evening, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Fifty singers aged 23 to 69 came, from the geneticist in human medicine to the man at home.
&quot;Om&#39;Obani&quot; is not an easy piece, each singer has different lyrics, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, in Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
To be helped to help oneself
UNAIDS, the United Nations program for the fight against AIDS, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are infected with the disease.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected people.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; association.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a sponsor.
This sum guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo centre.
Imbongi means &quot;storyteller&quot; or even &quot;praise singer&quot; in Zulu.
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the choir has been rehearsing songs in this foreign language that it brought to Germany to now return to its native region: southern Africa.
Because 8.733 kilometers as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest straw or mud huts and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans because HIV took their parents.
In Esitjeni, one can observe on a smaller scale the ills that plague Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure which nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
Over 40% of Swaziland&#39;s population carry the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in your mid-thirties.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village. The Imbongis especially saw many children in the street who lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
At first, it was just a few people who made a personal commitment to pay a few euros each year so that they could send a child to school and provide them with a hot meal a day.
But barely a year later, the choir founded &quot;Voices for Africa&quot;, an association which has since taken care of the AIDS orphans of Esitjeni in an almost professional manner.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea (or gonorrhea).
Common STIs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies belong to parasitic STIs.
Which groups are mainly affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea often appear in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men is the cause of at least four out of five reported cases of syphilis in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydial infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of HIV spread between heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections occur among this group.
Among young people, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamydial infections than among other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections occur in young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure rose from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has been falling.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual disease?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white discharge, pain in the lower abdomen as well as the appearance of pimples and warts.
However, they regularly cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they don&#39;t provide 100% protection.
The reason for this is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or close bodily contact.
Experts therefore recommend that anyone who often changes sexual partners undergo regular examinations.
Most STIs detected early can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all to the funds that the choristers collect thanks to their voices throughout Germany, the means accumulate.
&quot;In all, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni&quot;, specifies Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
She also sees to it that the orphans are well housed, with one of their grandmothers for example.
The gogos, as old women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them take in up to 14 orphans, provide them with shelter and make sure they get to school on time every day in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is welcomed in a safe place, with Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals for more than 200 starving children every day.
In addition, &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; has created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chicken coops. With the help of the American health organization PSI, the association organized an HIV screening test for many residents.
This is not self-evident, because even if the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
&quot;AIDS is a real taboo&quot;, explains Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it is a subject that affects sexuality.&quot;
That&#39;s quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
Black Africa&#39;s last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-sanctioned mores, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
Condoms can be found on every street corner, adds Annette Lennartz, &quot;but hardly anyone uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh.&quot;
In order to somewhat promote cultural exchange, the choristers of Imbongi go together on a trip every two or three years to southern Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity. that many inhabitants of the tip of the black continent still know from the time of apartheid.
The bus full of white people singing in the African language is such a sign of recognition that it not only engenders good humor and joy, but sometimes also brings tears to a few formidable border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the choristers visit their godchildren.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
“Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there,” say the people there.
And after a journey of 8.733 kilometers as the crow flies, back in Heidelberg, in front of these choristers who stamp their feet in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, there is also light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The layer of ice could reach 20 meters in thickness.
The American space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published this Thursday in the specialized journal &quot;Science&quot;.
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the permanently shadowed region of the planet.
This cover would be at least 30 centimeters thick, up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably comes from comets or maybe asteroids that would have collided with Mercury.
However, no one makes a connection between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of the presence of life on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help understand how water and other life-sustaining elements arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, like small interstices through which we observe infinity.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a &quot;planet&quot;, according to the International Astronomical Union&#39;s new definition of the term in 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a &quot;family portrait&quot; of the countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink spots, which are more difficult to identify, are the &quot;newborns&quot;. in the birthing room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where stars are born, baptized &quot;W5&quot;, a very unromantic name, in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light years away.
NASA&#39;s Spitzer Telescope has captured the blazing glow of a dying star.
The donut-shaped circle is made up of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the massive Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust are forming new stars.
The Spitzer Telescope has photographed this galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades, star clusters also called &quot;the seven sisters&quot;, can be observed with the naked eye at night.
However, the telescope brings out the colors more.
In this infrared photo, the Helix Nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to a terrestrial continent has earned it the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and the infrared photo makes it possible to observe a spectacular hue.
Only the Spitzer Telescope&#39;s infrared detectors were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest puzzles in astronomy concerns the creation of Saturn&#39;s rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is of the Tourbillon galaxy.
Depending on the hue, photographs of spiral galaxies can become true works of art.
The photograph released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word &quot;trifidus&quot; (divided, divided into three), as three trails of dust divide the glowing heart of the birthplace of stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic pile-up in the constellation Serpentarius: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies are rushing towards each other, the collision is inevitable .
The Hubble Telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don&#39;t like technical abbreviations, you can use his nickname &quot;southern wheel of fire&quot;.
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a detail of the Iris Nebula, in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and is made up of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than common house dust.
This photo was developed from optical and radiographic images taken by different telescopes.
We can see the circle composed of black holes which is 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope photographed this group of galaxies called Arp 273 for NASA.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy &quot;GC 1810&quot;.
Within this nebula is the brightest cluster of young stars in our Milky Way.
The celestial cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosette Nebula, are also continuously creating young stars 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy with luminous rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists believe he was born shortly after the big bang, when the universe was largely made up of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale Telescope at Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror in this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It makes it possible to observe the universe through two mirrors each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The underbelly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Canary Islands, is huge. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa has been segmented to save money.
The diameter still reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the economical construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its great capacity for collecting light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity approaches that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
Scientists listen to the universe for extraterrestrial signals using the radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help in the &quot;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence&quot; (SETI, or &quot;search for extraterrestrial intelligence&quot;) by harnessing the computing power of their machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope (&quot;very large telescope&quot;), a facility worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope won&#39;t be able to take pictures until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck&#39;s two telescopes on Hawaii&#39;s Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They sported two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
The Keck Telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory which observes the sky with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTF.
A new gigantic telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to admire it.
However, the most important images from space come to us from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has given us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space no earlier than 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope will notably have the task of finding light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the big bang.
Scientists believe Mercury&#39;s south pole is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to Mercury&#39;s North Pole.
Radar data had indicated the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter daily, and live to be 168
In the South of Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity there.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years old.
In the South of Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity there.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years old.
The trip to the Talysh Mountains is wildly romantic.
Around the many bends in the road, the little bus bumps along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, it almost feels like being in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the Deep South of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group called Talysh lives, about whom not much is known, except that they speak perfect Persian and Azeri and have a very high longevity.
Terminal: Lerik.
The small town swaggers with its overly aggressive Soviet-era architecture that doesn&#39;t match the picturesque mountain scenery at all.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to cover the 323 kilometers, as the road has only one lane.
The province has yet to benefit from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist spot.
&quot;Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world here,&quot; says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
One can discover there the life of approximately eight tens of Talysh of the area which are more than 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he reached the age of 120.
Having another child at 136
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when you consider that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, Müslümov&#39;s age seems more than doubtful.
&quot;He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973&quot;, specifies Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and he would have had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have conceived a daughter.
Was Şirali Müslümov mistaken by a few decades when calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard him speak of the elderly man of Central Asia.
&quot;Surprisingly old people also live in parts of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;in Sardinia too there are men who live incredibly old.&quot;
However, it is impossible to establish scientific proof due to the non-existence of documents, not to mention that there was no civil status register.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
It is nevertheless a fact that the people of the region of Lerik often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
What then is the reason for the longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have special genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it is a question of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the high-calorie meals of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good. for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She is sitting on the ground next to a churn, the contents of which she beats tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, among them one of Mirzayeva&#39;s sons and a daughter, who have long since grown up.
Two small children are also frolicking in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for the guests, served in typical belly-shaped armadus glasses.
Mirzayeva&#39;s white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf are hidden long dark blond braids that her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, and that&#39;s how I never lost it and kept its color.
&quot;I&#39;ve never used shampoo,&quot; adds Mirzayeva.
The monthly pension is enough to live on
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In all my life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst times were after World War II.
But everything got better when &quot;beloved father&quot; Heydar Aliyev took over.
The language of propaganda surprises in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the nation&#39;s father figure, a man who once ruled his country like a dictator, knows almost no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded him thereafter.
Be that as it may, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not experience distress.
Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manats (about the same amount as in euros) for her pension, an amount that guarantees a good standard of living in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva&#39;s long-grayed son is right: &quot;Elders enjoy great respect in our culture.&quot;
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The &quot;human rights&quot; omitted from the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Rival protests reveal the country&#39;s deep divide.
The proposed sharia-based constitution is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president is not stingy with words filled with emotions.
We have to make the transition successful.
&quot;And this achievement is my responsibility to the people and to God,&quot; he told state television.
His speech was intended for the whole people, but also especially for Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened and secular Muslims.
Because all the members of the confused and hopelessly disunited opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi declared, almost apologetically, having temporarily restricted the competences of the Constitutional Court and widened his own &quot;in order to save the revolution&quot;.
However, Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles hastily drafted by the predominantly Islamic Constituent Assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour nightly tour de force are indeed disturbing to some degree.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on &quot;the principles of Islamic law&quot;.
But what does the word &quot;principles&quot; really mean?
It was and still is a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists will use the vague wording and the resulting legal leeway to enforce a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At any rate, this is suggested by a newly introduced article stipulating that, regarding all Sharia matters, al-Azhar University must be consulted. The establishment is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its brilliance radiates throughout the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean, that the clergy will oversee the legislative apparatus, which would result in the de facto putting under the guardianship of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak&#39;s reign, these courts worked to repress opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The state must also, the draft says, protect &quot;the true nature of the Egyptian family&quot; and &quot;promote its morals and values&quot;.
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature art.
Clearly, it would simply be censorship.
Moreover, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
However, the article does not define what an offense is or how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording implying that it is forbidden to &quot;offend people&quot;.
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or tell a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the project that Morsi is submitting to the vote and which, in his own words, will &quot;very soon&quot; be the subject of a referendum among the Egyptians.
&quot;The revolution is reborn&quot;
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of the Islamists.
On Friday night, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual concord in Cairo&#39;s Tahrir Square, vowing to topple Sharia law before it comes into force.
&quot;The revolution is reborn and we are going to win,&quot; said Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei said the draft Constitution is &quot;to be thrown into the dustbin of history&quot;.
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi supporters of wanting to foment a &quot;putsch against democracy&quot;.
&quot;If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,&quot; exclaimed Jasser Said, an opponent.
&quot;We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned for,&quot; said Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition, according to Egyptian media.
In addition, several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its nullity.
&quot;The Koran is our Constitution&quot;
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-demonstration not in Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a large prayer was organized in front of Cairo University. .
Veiled women and Salafist supporters, who participated in large numbers, chanted: &quot;The people demand the application of the law of God.&quot;
&quot;Clean up our country!&quot;, they asked Morsi, claiming that &quot;the Koran [was their] Constitution&quot;.
A fight for sovereignty over the symbolic Tharir Square, where it all began, would soon have engendered a situation akin to civil war.
Obviously, this is what Morsi&#39;s supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said opponents of the draft Constitution, as well as its supporters, had spoken out loud and clear.
According to them, now is the time to let the people decide through the ballot box which direction the country should take.
The Islamists&#39; project will certainly win a majority.
“Human rights are not mentioned once”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process which should have lasted until February and encompassed all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their view of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
This is the reason why he was beaten up, tried and imprisoned.
&quot;And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution&quot;, he regrets during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi&#39;s powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant attacks on the rules of democracy and they will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
&quot;Instead of strengthening civil society, the president is de facto stripping it of all its powers,&quot; Saeda laments.
However, a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, which watches the battle between different political ideologies on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
It could be paid.
A protester in Tharir Square warns: &quot;You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control.&quot;
Norwegian rakfisk: is it the smelliest fish in the world?
Norway&#39;s five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not just in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country&#39;s success have to do with the locals&#39; appetite for extremely smelly fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway&#39;s most popular delicacies.
I&#39;m in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It&#39;s snowing, the scenery is spectacular - and that omnipresent smell permeates the air.
Rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for a period of time - depending on how you want it to smell - which can be up to a year.
When darkness sets in and the weather gets cold, Norwegians flock in droves to attend a festival held here in Fagernes dedicated to this incredible culinary delicacy.
“You eat raw, then you down a glass of aquavit,” says Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter who is also known as “Rakfisk General”, responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people are swallowing small pieces of fish and drinking a large amount of drink.
“Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk,” adds Havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I try a few pieces.
If you can avoid having it pass under your nose, that&#39;s not bad - it&#39;s reminiscent of sushi that has been sitting for long hours on a bus.
Rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration the fish was immersed in airtight barrels of water and then salted in autumn.
Then, over the winter, once well fermented, the fish was taken out and - no doubt with the senses diminished by the alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high salaries and a comprehensive healthcare system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered something important, a vital, albeit fragrant, part of Norway&#39;s past.
It is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will set you back €10 each.
Norway is not often talked about in the international news, which is not to displease him.
People here are unwilling to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who shot 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this massacre, they speak of the &quot;July 22 incident&quot;.
The Norwegians find it hard to accept that in their peaceful country, one of their own could have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has owed its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
&quot;But oil is not the only reason for our success,&quot; explains Anna, our waitress, with blonde hair and piercing blue eyes, the image of Nordic well-being, with a tray of rakfisk by hand.
We are - how do you say - careful people.
His English, like that of most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth very carefully - everything except a small percentage of money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries were throwing money away in the years leading up to the international financial crisis, Norway kept its purse strings tight.
“As long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
“Not to mention the rakfisk,” she adds with a carefree laugh.
I&#39;m standing in the snow and queuing to buy myself something to eat - I&#39;ve had my fill of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger made with elk, a real discovery, it&#39;s excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I&#39;m staying in is one of many places that serve rakfisk for dinner and where you can vote for the best - or maybe the smelliest - .
There&#39;s a TV show where the presenter wears a bow tie, surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
It feels like the Eurovision Song Contest.
&quot;What score did you give the best fish, in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?&quot;
&quot;Here are our points, Havard.&quot;
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, possibly from aquavit abuse.
Or maybe it&#39;s because of the fish fumes.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto is off to a tough start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, the BBC&#39;s Will Grant looks at the challenges ahead and the many expectations of the people.
Road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad right now.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal times, a security roadblock has been in place since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent the demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico&#39;s economy is doing well, thanks to outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the throes of a drug war that has already claimed around 60,000 lives in six years.
&quot;My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,&quot; Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before rubbing shoulders with the American President, Mr. Pena Nieto was Governor of the State of Mexico.
A very populated and sprawling state that surrounds the capital. On his favorite land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A straightforward man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in everyone&#39;s memory.
Locals credit him with the development of tourism and infrastructure in the town.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new highways from M Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made to these roads, which were once bumpy and full of crevasses.
Plaques bearing his name hang outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
&quot;We are counting on him to put in place lasting changes,&quot; said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a congressman and member of Pena Nieto&#39;s party, the PRI.
In terms of security and the economy in particular, we hope for a real change that our country so badly needs.
After 81 unbroken years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace in Los Pinos, there are high expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects criticism from opponents who accuse the new president of lacking charisma.
He is a whole man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image that people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo couldn&#39;t be starker.
Hidden under highway flyovers, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to help fight drug gangs that run rampant in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious there.
In a disaster area, the bodies of dozens of women murdered over the past two years have been found on the edge of a dump.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr Pena Nieto was governor, a rate far higher than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place notorious for the number of innocent women there. been killed.
Critics of Mr. Pena Nieto say that at best he failed to stem the problem of murders perpetrated against women while in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this run-down neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back tears when she shows me photos of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reports a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family believe she was killed by her partner.
“When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed,” says Señora Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the rigor mortis had already set in.
As her mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana adorns the wall, next to a cross with the word: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, a troublemaker, a whiner.
They want us to accept what they say and shut up.
&quot;But it&#39;s not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,&quot; she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his sash on Saturday, it will come with a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised that he will make it a priority during his term.
&quot;I hope he&#39;s as good as president as he was when he was governor,&quot; Olvera, a Valle del Bravo, congressman, said.
However, this is exactly what the families of the Ciudad Neza victims fear the most.
Bradley Manning has not complained of abuse, say prosecutors.
Prosecutors are trying to counter claims of abuse Bradley Manning allegedly suffered while in custody.
The lawsuit concerns Manning&#39;s detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to close the case on the grounds that Manning&#39;s sequestration was carried out under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to show on Friday that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of being the source of the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the American military -- missed numerous opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
In cross-examination with Manning during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein claimed that records of weekly visits made to Manning by officers during his nine months in custody in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
Cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defense brought a motion demanding that the Manning case be dismissed on the grounds that the forcible confinement was carried out under very difficult conditions and was a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place a day after Manning testified that he wanted to kill himself while in custody.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were later published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was their source.
During Friday&#39;s hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms the officers filled out after meeting Manning while he was held in Quantico military prison, where he was held in maximum solitary confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein discussed the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment he received from his guards was &quot;excellent&quot; and that the treatment he received within the prison was &quot;very professional overall.&quot;
The forms do not list any complaints of mistreatment, although officers questioned him directly about his prison treatment, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he had verbally expressed concerns about some issues and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not record the issues raised.
&quot;They wrote &#39;no issues&#39; (after addressing the concerns), and yet that didn&#39;t mean I didn&#39;t raise issues,&quot; Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he hadn&#39;t complained about his treatment during a January 2011 interview with the special commission that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months previously.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to have his restrictive status changed indicating &quot;risk of injury&quot;.
The military said they assigned him this restrictive status -- one level below close watch for suicide risk -- for his protection and the safety of others.
&quot;I wanted the staff to know that I was okay, and I wanted to have that status taken away...to have a better quality of life from my perspective,&quot; Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Va., in July. 2010.
He said he contemplated suicide while in Kuwait and once passed out from the heat.
He added that not being kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very distressing.
&quot;My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage,&quot; Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 9 p.m. and sometimes more than 11 p.m. -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had were a mattress, a blanket, flip flops, clothes and his glasses.
He tried to keep moving, as sleeping or lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning also clarified that when he was trying to sleep he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards didn&#39;t see his face when he rolled over at night, they would wake him up so they could see his face.
Manning&#39;s attorney filed a formal complaint for Manning&#39;s treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge questioned Manning about an allegation in his Thursday testimony -- that after he was forced to sleep naked all night in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates one morning during roll call.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with a blanket during the call.
During the judge&#39;s questioning on Friday, Manning said he inferred from his guard&#39;s order that he should let go of his blanket which might have concealed his nudity, but he acknowledged that no one ordered him to let go. .
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night as he allegedly tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning allegedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic in his underpants or his flip flops to hurt himself, but he didn&#39;t.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, flip flops, and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will consider his experiences while in custody and significantly reduce his sentence should he be found guilty at a court martial, a trial that is expected to be held early in the year. &#39;next year.
The defense said Manning plans to plead guilty to the lesser offenses and fight to have other charges deemed too extreme committed.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning was incarcerated in accordance with regulations that govern the conditions of confinement of all detainees at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy resulting in the unlawful publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to national defense.
If all charges are upheld, he faces life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, past customs and immigration, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two lanes: one for &quot;Mexicanos&quot; (&quot;Mexicans&quot;), another for &quot;Extranjeros&quot; (&quot;Foreigners&quot;).
I stood still for several seconds, not knowing which lane to go to.
I grew up in central California, where I&#39;ve been called &quot;Mexican&quot; all my life.
It is an ethnic qualifier, just like the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves &quot;Irish&quot;, or my friends in New York when they call themselves &quot;Italian&quot;.
Then I became &quot;Mexican-American&quot;.
But here was Mexico.
And, on the land where my grandfather was born, there is no need for a special qualifier or a hyphen.
I was simply an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle an interview in either language.
But I don&#39;t have a native&#39;s vocabulary, and I can&#39;t lose my American accent.
So I took my US passport and headed to the &quot;Foreigners&quot; line.
I thought of that time of week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than venture into the United States.
He wants to ally with the United States and Canada, and create a Union for trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto pledges to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide further details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness.
Most Americans have probably never considered the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to hand over half their territory in writing at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a US official utters the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans are undermining sovereignty. of their neighbor.
And Montezuma&#39;s kids are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the one the country has with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
Do you want to talk about bitterness?
There are many.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not.
The only reason for the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree, a person, perhaps a relative or a grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go North.
And more often than not, that person would fit a typical profile -- dark-skinned, poorly educated, from a poor village, and so on.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we are currently living the American dream, having gone to good schools and having good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we are living, and not that of Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes confused, but our loyalty is evident.
We grant it in the United States.
Moreover, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they stare at us as if we were individuals of inferior stock and not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn&#39;t failed when they lived in Mexico, they never would have left.
And we wouldn&#39;t find ourselves stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and emigrated legally to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is friction between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, as Mexicans claim their identity more firmly and Mexican Americans are upset about it.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels like she is part of two countries.
Also, many Mexican Americans I know don&#39;t feel like they belong in one country or the other.
We love the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, certain Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work as makeshift ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country that absolutely must be visited and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes of course.
It will not happen.
There is too much bitterness.
And, considering the wage inequality, corruption and drug-related violence that are rampant, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You&#39;re going to have to fend for yourself, amigos.
It&#39;s normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way it treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they must accept that some Mexican Americans still resent them the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we are more &quot;Mexican&quot; than I thought.
Old Quarrels, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is yet another failure for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is in vain.
While the same futile arguments about who started it persist, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; over 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, Israel&#39;s metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem locked in their old conflict, all around them the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring shattered everything, and whether we like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little more.
Still, there&#39;s every reason to think it could help them out of this deadly stalemate.
A war that has no losers and no winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Even if the ceasefire granted on November 21 holds, this week&#39;s fighting has strengthened supporters of the force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to give up, even though Gaza has taken a beating.
Having killed some of its leaders and driven back the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza into one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has not succeeded in destroying Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas could tell themselves that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a rising regional power, once Israel&#39;s closest Muslim ally, has taken up the cause of Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members gloat and say the Islamist crescent curves around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where the Hezbollah militia holds sway, to Syria, where Islamist-leaning rebels can topple Bashar El Assad, and as far as Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on Israel&#39;s southern flank, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time for Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders rely more easily on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important player that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, Israel&#39;s hardliners will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been re-boxed.
The missile interception system called Iron Dome proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelis are going to be able to rest easy - for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have blamed Hamas for being behind the latest wave of violence.
But above all, Israel has prospered, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who completely ignored the peace process.
Although rocket attacks from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared suicide bombings, not least thanks to the separation barrier that encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish settlements which continue to expand despite their illegality under international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more hawkish party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, has a winning streak.
Why coddle those pesky Palestinians by giving them a state?
If they ruled the West Bank, wouldn&#39;t they launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It&#39;s best to keep them behind that wall and hit them as soon as they stick their heads out.
Perhaps the hardliners will prevail; but the Arab Spring may change that.
Even if the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere dislike Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
Israel&#39;s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments fix their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to secure a ceasefire, which bodes well -- and could be the start of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, denying the Palestinians their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is bound to explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories - much like the bus that exploded in Tel- Aviv this week.
Repression is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are exacerbating this problem as the Arab population grows.
The bloody missions into Gaza every two or three years to ring out Hamas will have a diplomatic price.
Both sides need to be pushed by those on the outside.
The answer remains the one advocated by reasonable people on either side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with Israel ceding territory in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will provide an opportunity for outsiders to champion this cause.
Egypt, which must now work to end the flow of arms to Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state according to 1967 borders with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the upcoming proposal for a pseudo-state at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has every interest in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It&#39;s a very narrow view.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for plain cigarette packs come into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of diseased organs cover the dark green packets that are all identical, regardless of brand
This law, which came into force in Australia, is a world first, the logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrific photos of diseased organs and depictions of children and babies whose illnesses have been caused by their parents&#39; smoking.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, as of this Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small type on all the packages.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
Australia&#39;s federal government said the aim was to deter young people from smoking by removing all glamorous portrayal.
Studies have shown that if people didn&#39;t start smoking until age 26, there&#39;s a 99% chance they&#39;ll never start.
“Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco companies through their brand image,” Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek said, citing studies that found for example that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess.&quot;
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on multinational profits, other countries are considering a similar move.
The tobacco industry lobbied against this law.
Tobacco companies said it would kick-start black market trade, which will provide easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
&quot;Adverse consequences will flow from this legislation,&quot; said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said the law boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to hide the ugly packaging, had risen sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain&#39;s Imperial Tobacco , Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in the High Court of Australia.
Ha said Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting restocking.
For us, business is good.
The only downside, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the demographic targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising, sports sponsorship and requiring retailers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned web advertising by local companies and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
“If you work in tobacco marketing and only have a small storefront left to promote your products, the internet is the go-to place,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman has noticed an increase in contributions from some average citizens in favor of brands on social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves, is this a private citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and went to the trouble of making a video, or is this an agency-orchestrated marketing campaign?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focused on the new regulations rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court rulings - these countries have told the WHO that the trade is being unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries has had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in the course of 2013.
Plibersek said the government has held discussions with other countries regarding similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to mandate warning photos on packaging in 2001.
Now, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are currently under consideration in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain oblivious to these photos.
The pictures don&#39;t bother me.
I ignore them.
&quot;You take a cigarette and you put the packet away,&quot; Victor El Hage said when buying a packet that featured a photo of a tumor in his mouth.
To be frank, the only reason that will make me quit is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of &#39;King of the Pack tobacconist&#39; in central Sydney, said the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to arrange packs on shelves.
“Before, it took me an hour to unload a parcel, now it takes me four hours,” Yu said.
&quot;The government had only to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it&#39;s good, we stop and we put the key under the door&quot;, he added, raising his arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to be bored.
I spent five hours at an airport over Thanksgiving because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I won&#39;t lie to you.
Spending half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is boring enough, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention the duty-free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and child development experts are praising boredom.
It&#39;s perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored once in a while, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, even nurturing creativity.
And since most of us are constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
But I will come back to it.
First of all, like many people, I thought boredom was a fairly recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But that&#39;s not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of &quot;Boredom: A Lively History&quot; (Yale University Press, 2011).
“Boredom goes way back,” he says.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After scanning numerous publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of around 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience of &quot;wanting to do something, but not being able to engage in a satisfying activity.&quot;
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task although they would like to.
With apathy, he says, there is no urge to do anything.
What is at the heart of boredom, he said, is “the interruption of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time is passing slowly.”
Boredom can strongly resemble depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while the two may be linked, people who are bored tend to think the problem is with the environment or the world, while people who are depressed think the problem is with them.
Sometimes we think we&#39;re bored when it&#39;s actually a problem with concentration.
In their study, &quot;The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention&quot;, which was published in the journal &quot;Perspectives on Psychological Science&quot; in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an older experience in which participants listened on tape to the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard from the next room too loud an unrelated TV broadcast, others just heard the TV broadcast, and the third group did not didn&#39;t hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard the TV at a low level said they were more bored than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but did not know why, and attributed the concentration problem to boredom.
When you&#39;re trying to focus on a difficult or time-consuming task, an interruption in attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and the one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you&#39;re doing a boring task, &quot;like looking at things on an assembly line, music can help keep you from getting bored.&quot;
In fact, he says, now we know that when we squirm or doodle, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to fidget learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still,” Professor Fenske said.
We are all bored at one time or another - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monotonous voice, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more likely to be bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed the &quot;Boredom Prone Scale&quot; in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, &quot;Many of the tasks I do are repetitive and monotonous&quot;, and &quot;I have so many interests that I don&#39;t have time to do them all. .&quot;
Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need many and varied stimulations. .
But in general, teenagers are quickly jaded.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers said they were bored at school and while doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren&#39;t in school.
In contrast, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if boredom percentages today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knows that &quot;teenage is a time when boredom reaches its peak&quot;, not least because children and teenagers don&#39;t have much control over what they want to do.
If I rest my question: is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can cause people to take absurd physical risks, gamble or abuse certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
By contrast, many philosophers and writers point to a connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
&quot;Boredom is the brain&#39;s way of letting you know you should be doing something else,&quot; said NYU psychology professor Gary Marcus.
But the brain doesn&#39;t always know what the most appropriate thing to do is.
If you are bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give them an iPad, they won&#39;t be bored, but they won&#39;t have learned self-care or self-regulation, says Professor Fenske.
And &quot;this self-regulation moves from one situation to another,&quot; he says.
Your child isn&#39;t just learning how to be entertained, they&#39;re gaining more self-control in other areas.
I don&#39;t think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I don&#39;t think we should criticize it either.
Feeling comfortable outside of the constant buzz of business and technology is what we should be aiming for.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
&quot;We need to be bored more often, but boredom stirs a sharp, frantic desire to be connected to something meaningful,&quot; he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy the downtime.
&quot;In an environment where we&#39;re constantly overstimulated,&quot; he added, &quot;it&#39;s hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops.&quot;
In Colorado, no guidelines for new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student and soccer player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana pellets and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he and some friends were in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons for possession of the drug and equipment that could be used for its consumption - minor offenses, each carrying a fine of 100 $ - and an appearance date.
“We are being treated like criminals,” Mr. Orozco said.
But is it one?
During the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado&#39;s vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on location than law .
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offenses involving the use of marijuana have been dismissed.
Police departments have stopped charging adults 21 and older with underage possession of marijuana as the law comes into effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in more conservative Colorado precincts have called for expediting existing marijuana cases and are continuing to charge those who possess it.
Meanwhile, several towns from suburban Denver to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent state-licensed marijuana businesses from opening in their neighborhoods.
&quot;Things are changing so quickly that I don&#39;t know what the future holds,&quot; said Aurora Police Chief Daniel J. Oates, east of Denver.
Washington state regulators also have a lot of questions.
They are seeking guidelines on how to set up a licensing system, authorizing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the December 1, 2013 deadline.
They say that Colorado, like it or not, is ahead of most states when it comes to marijuana regulations, first in therapeutic use and now in personal use.
&quot;Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator,&quot; said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Smith acknowledges, can do more than suggest what works.
&quot;There&#39;s no real precedent we could build on,&quot; he said.
Washington&#39;s law, called I-502, takes effect Dec. 6, leaving a one-year loophole during which the licensing system will still not exist, while possession of marijuana will be legal. .
Meanwhile, practical questions remain unanswered: how to balance the state mandate that guarantees appropriate access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the establishment of cannabis businesses within 30 km of a school , park, playground or nursery.
&quot;There will be no places more difficult than urban areas to set up a licensed business selling cannabis, especially in the Seattle metro area,&quot; said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson for the Center for Cannabis Legalization, a newly formed research group.
On Nov. 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates sent an email to his officers announcing that the City Attorney would no longer prosecute people 21 and older who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop charging people for this type of offense &quot;with immediate effect.&quot;
Chief Oates said police will enforce new court orders that regulate the activity of those who grow medical marijuana, and he will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the &quot;district attorney&quot; (Attorney of the Republic), Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to handle marijuana possession cases, primarily to pressure users to get detoxified.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them face other charges.
&quot;Our office has an obligation to prosecute these individuals who have committed an offense which, at the material time, was a recognized offence,&quot; Buck said.
Reactions were complicated even in rural places like Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative in favor of restricted marijuana use.
Police in Grand Junction, the county&#39;s largest city, are no longer bringing adults to court for possession of restricted amounts.
County District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported the move, but also decided not to drop all marijuana possession cases.
&quot;I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes,&quot; he said.
Although 55 percent of voters in Colorado supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and governmental framework for the personal use of marijuana is not easy.
And the mixed reactions that have been seen in different US cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
&quot;It&#39;s a cultural barrier&quot; with the prosecution officials, said Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney who represents those charged with marijuana use and who speaks as a local spokesperson for the &quot;National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws&quot;.
&quot;They&#39;ve spent a good part of their lives prosecuting people for using marijuana, so they have a hard time accepting that it&#39;s legal,&quot; he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana use on the same level as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are set to become a case for drug legalization.
As advocates and state officials plan for a new frontier of legalized sales, they anxiously await direction from the federal government, which still views the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Marijuana legalization advocates are hoping the Justice Department will relent.
Despite some high-profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and vendors, the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana businesses to operate in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it&#39;s true that the police are unlikely to break down doors to seize small packets of drugs, it&#39;s a safe bet that they will oppose the licensed businesses selling marijuana for personal use allowed by the new laws. said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many Colorado cities did not wait for federal authorities to act.
Long before the votes, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana businesses, even if it is only a one-year delay.
Last week, the town of Montrose was granted a 6-month moratorium, and is expected to impose the ban next week.
“We don&#39;t want to end up in a situation where somebody is given a license and then we end up with a federal problem,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the community vote rather than the state vote.
Many questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied and kicked out of Oxford because I was a Tory (conservative).
It is not just today&#39;s students who are attacked for their opinions.
As far back as I can remember, I have always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and my older brother studied in what was for me an eminent place of learning, a sort of modern-day Greek amphitheater that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet two weeks after moving to Worcester College in the late 80s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, sparking the first scandal of my life.
My dad broke down and started crying.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I left this university because I objected to undergraduates having sex in the room next to mine.
Author AN Wilson joked that I left after being forced to drink from chipped cups.
The truth was less funny.
I fled.
Yes, I fled because I had been intimidated and constantly bullied.
Not because of my rather outrageous name, nor because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one and only reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a Conservative Party supporter.
Why bring up this today, you will say.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of center-right students are experiencing the same kind of persecution.
Such is the growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students at Oxford that last week some of them demanded protection of their rights, along with those of gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College&#39;s Student Hall (JCR) said they were &quot;often isolated, personally attacked and felt unwanted&quot; because of their political views.
They want there to be a representative on the university&#39;s Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation has not been made easier by the recent BBC Two documentary &#39;Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right&#39;, about student politics. , which portrayed the &quot;Tories&quot; as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
We discovered in particular the student Joe Cooke, former president of the “Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA)”, who travels in a Rolls-Royce, wears a silver suit and travels with a cane with a chrome head.
At other universities, conservative students say they are being treated as scapegoats for the implementation of the tuition hike.&quot;
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper &quot;there is a growing left-wing bias at universities.
People think we&#39;re like the Bullingdon Club without even having met us.&quot;
Samuel Roberts, 21, a Corpus Christi history student who moved a motion for more protection, says such a climate is &quot;uncomfortable&quot;, and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OUCA, says that there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are centre-right.
“It constitutes an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of the members,” she said.
I was the only one to think so during my first weeks at Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, I was then 18 years old and paralyzingly shy.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted to refuse to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in funding for graduate studies.
The atmosphere was charged with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students got to know each other and the teachers, I had a taste of what was to come next.
I discovered that the teachers not only participated in the sarcasm towards Tory students, but that they also took pleasure in it.
It was as if the politics of striking miners, privatization and the government&#39;s opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa were carved into the wood of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm I received was about a translation into English of French texts from the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
&quot;Miss Wyatt&quot;, said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), &quot;please translate the first paragraph&quot;
I lost my footing.
Pitt, a short, pustular-faced man, was quick-tempered.
&quot;Do Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?&quot; he asked.
The other students laughed.
Tears burned my eyes.
&quot;I suggest you take French lessons in your spare time - well, if you&#39;re not too busy making friends,&quot; he snapped.
I returned to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and then felt a light tap on my shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
&quot;I know who you are,&quot; he said, kindly.
I am afraid that is so.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It&#39;s hard enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it&#39;ll be even harder for you.
Most Tory youth claim to be Labour.
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher had said.
This ploy failed.
A first-year philosophy, political science and economics student who ironically had studied at Eton said: &#39;You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contaminated.
Other students picked up the chorus.
I was perverted, dirty.
&quot;How Do Tories Make Love?&quot; one of them asked.
They hit each other, don&#39;t they?&quot;
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
Could I have just led a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I have become Labor and deny my opinions?
The next three years would be like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a Tory, but also because he was Thatcher&#39;s foreign policy adviser and one of the writers of her speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey.
&quot;You won&#39;t be happy here,&quot; he told me.
I began commuting between Oxford and my parents&#39; home in London, finding refuge with my family and more open-minded city friends.
I told my dad I hated Oxford and explained why.
He was in disbelief.
While studying at Oxford in the 1940s, all political points of view were accepted.
&quot;But it&#39;s the best place in the world,&quot; he told me pathetically.
They wouldn&#39;t do that, not in the city of dreamy steeples.
Even my communist friends had impeccable manners.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, when another history teacher suggested in all earnestness that I was &quot;an enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do the same.
Inwardly blushing with shame, I admitted to being brainwashed by my parents and called them &quot;crazy old men.&quot;
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who drove the final nail in my Oxford coffin.
At that time, he was writing two columns in Murdoch&#39;s press each week.
My door was locked.
I remained crouched in my room, and after five minutes my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never went back there.
You can call me a whiny sissy.
But no 18-year-old should be bullied like this in school.
Most tragically, it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers but also enjoys an unshakable reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
&quot;Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety&quot;
As part of the &quot;Valentino: A Master of Couture&quot; exhibition, which opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian couturier.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier recognized this during the inauguration of &quot;Valentino: a Master of Couture&quot;, a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for his fashion house over the past 50 years.
&quot;I love this palace,&quot; he said in his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose sole protagonist is &quot;il signore&quot; Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed and apart world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, there is an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing by Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exhibits his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascent: from the modest couturier of the town of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There&#39;s nothing wrong with loving royalty.
&quot;At least they don&#39;t stub out their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet like some pop music stars do,&quot; says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
&quot;We all loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad&quot;, explains the ex-wife of &quot;Heini&quot; Thyssen, a close friend of beauties from the past such as Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And even so, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charisma of the couturier either.
Several years ago, after a parade in the Spanish Steps, Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
You could see and feel his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in the decor, the food, the music.
&quot;With him, each guest felt important and appreciated,&quot; recalls the &quot;top model&quot;, who began working with him during Haute-Couture week in Paris in 1995.
&quot;He will never go out of fashion, because his creations are works of art&quot;, she concludes.
Nobility Line Parade
Garavani&#39;s life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He likes people who are well brought up and with the greatest titles and they like him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous catwalk sixty meters wide which proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade on the catwalk to admire a dream &quot;audience&quot; wearing the main Valentino creations, such as the suit Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the suit worn by Monica Vitti in &quot;La Notte&quot;, or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
Among this public of models, we find names like Sybille from Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sophie from Habsbourg.
Naty Abascal and the designer in 2006
Many of his clients say that Valentino&#39;s first clothes are like first love, &quot;impossible to forget&quot;.
I remember it perfectly.
It was pants, a shirt, a &quot;gillette&quot; vest and a jacket from the fall-winter 1971-1972 collection.
&quot;It was a gift he gave me,&quot; said Naty Abascal, one of the couturier&#39;s muses.
&quot;I prefer him to all the others for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimates our beauty&quot;, adds the ex-duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses, they are bright and illuminate the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashionista Patricia della Giovampaola d&#39;Arenberg can&#39;t forget the first time she wore a Valentino model either.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, it was possible in the late 90s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red evening dress, with a ruffled skirt, a draped bustier and a neckline to die for.
&quot;It was a dream come true,&quot; said Rodrigue d&#39;Arenberg&#39;s widow.
&quot;Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless&quot;, explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg keeps the couturier&#39;s evening dresses with &quot;the greatest care, because an evening dress is not just a dress, it is also all the memories it conveys&quot;.
The &quot;king&quot; of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller&#39;s wedding dress worn when she married Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 &quot;ragazze&quot; (the couturier thus calls his seamstresses) to make this dress in ivory silk with inlays of pearls, twelve different kinds of lace and a train of four and a half meters.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the haute couture of the end of the 20th century, &quot;the return of the customers of the high society&quot;.
Obsessed for years by the &quot;savoir-être&quot; of the nobility, Valentino is now its best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any husband of his clients.
&quot;His refinement, his calm, his neat and perfect appearance have always jumped out at me,&quot; admits d&#39;Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d&#39;Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
&quot;He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him&quot;.
If it&#39;s a princess who says it...
The toughest job in the world: Kawah Ijen&#39;s human mules
For four euros, Indonesian volcano porters risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living carrying sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gas emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies on contact with the air.
After collecting large sulfur rocks, which altogether weigh nearly 70 kilos, he places them in two bamboo baskets which he loads on his shoulders through the steep paths.
It&#39;s only 250 meters to the summit of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters above sea level, but exhausted porters take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a turtle&#39;s pace, keeping their balance and measuring their not so as not to stumble and fall over the precipice.
They know that one wrong step could cost them their life, as happened to a French tourist who fell to her death in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 euro cents for each kilo of sulfur mined.
Once at the top, they make their way between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus beasts, and painfully carrying the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers to the scales that a mining company has installed. a little below at 1,850 meters above sea level.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, we can say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupiahs (5 euro cents) per kilo of sulphur.
She then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry since this mineral is very present in daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even serves to whiten sugar.
“As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip,” explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each one takes him 3 hours and he ends up exhausted, but it saves him 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems like a pittance for such superhuman effort, it is triple what he would earn in the fields.
“The income of miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” says the porter who worked once as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not so difficult, but Anto returned close to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason which, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as brimstone: &quot;I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and brought her back to Java to convert to Islam&quot;.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, constantly coughs and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27, he has spent three of his life defying danger on the Kawah ljen, but the brimstone has already started to make him foot the bill despite covering his face with a mask and wearing special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, constantly coughs and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
This is the price he must pay to pursue his dream.
&quot;I&#39;m going to work for two more years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French,&quot; he promises in more than acceptable English.
Busted by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead, he does the work of a mule.
He shares an unsanitary wooden hovel with other porters, gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not stop spurting out at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the midst of the darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater, lighting himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought for himself with his own money.
Some 400 porters load the sulfur baskets onto their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur extraction to save costs and does not provide any equipment to porters who are self-employed and paid by weight.
In addition, they also do not receive a penny of the 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) surcharge per camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
&quot;This work is for beasts, not for humans,&quot; protests Madrusin, a portly 42-year-old porter who has worked at Kawah Ijen for 30 years since leaving middle school.
Able to carry up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working &quot;as long as he can&quot;, because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years old.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke rising from the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from the serious illnesses... obviously add their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, 53-year-old Unainik can only load 50 kilos.
Every day he and his companions extract 15 tonnes of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the warehouse at Tamansari, 18 kilometers away via a weedy goat path.
&quot;I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life,&quot; Unainik says, opening his mouth wide, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of her five children, aged 30, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult jobs in the world: that of the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame this childlessness on careers, stress and the cost of home ownership.
&quot;Singapore&#39;s population must grow&quot;.
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem implausible that these lyrics come from an advertisement for breath mints, but despite this, or perhaps because of it, the video spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore at the start of this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like &quot;Let&#39;s go put a bun in the drawer&quot; to poke fun at Singapore&#39;s birth rate.
BBH, the ad agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the issue in a fun way with this ad.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do &quot;their national duty&quot;.
It&#39;s meant for the internet only, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We&#39;re the worst in the world when it comes to birth rates, so we felt that was something we needed to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like launching pheromone perfumes or organizing speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative but they didn&#39;t necessarily work.
So we thought to ourselves, what could be more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song out of it?
1.2 children
The Singapore government does not take it so lightly.
It spends US$1,300 a year on policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favor of marriages and fathers grants up to 15,000 dollars per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservative rulers and strict social controls.
Singapore&#39;s birth rate, in line with its national population distribution, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered the turnover rate, was in 1976.
Why don&#39;t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Division, says it&#39;s due to &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;a wider choice of career opportunities.&quot;
“It allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and starting a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of single people and delayed marriage and births, which results in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to counter the declining population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound with thinly disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially Chinese people who are accused of dragging wages down and failing to integrate.
Rising immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore&#39;s ruling party suffered its worst election results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While falling birth rates have known effects on a country&#39;s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore&#39;s example also has unintended consequences.
The government tries to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, it has started to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities began to control the number of small apartments, known as &quot;shoeboxes&quot;, that could be built in designated areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, authorities are concerned that they may promote a bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of property company EL Developers, says his &quot;shoeboxes&quot; are selling much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular, in the sense that these dwellings are built much faster than larger ones.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to developers, who were previously put in the way if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations could be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, talking to Singaporeans who work in the central financial district, it seems that they are not going to have much effect.
&quot;People are very stressed, houses are expensive, so is education, that&#39;s why people put it off,&quot; said a young manager.
The other people can have children.
&quot;But for me, it is important to be able to dispose of my money and my time,&quot; says another young man in his twenties.
Both men and women cite careers, stress and the cost of home ownership and education as the reasons preventing them from having children.
So, although the government tries to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans themselves have the final say.
What&#39;s private offline is private online
Privacy
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is the quality of the private domain or &quot;the domain of privacy that we can protect from any intrusion&quot;.
What is private for those under 16?
How to apply this definition in daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which he exposes himself by broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15, frequent users of the web.
In four of the cases, they associated the term &quot;something very personal&quot; on a personal level with &quot;password and username&quot; when applying it to social media.
&quot;I won&#39;t reveal my most personal secrets in a post,&quot; ten-year-old Jorge says when he tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he owns an account for two years.
&quot;These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them but not everyone,&quot; he says.
On FB, I post cool pictures or games.
I also chat with my friends.
&quot;I won&#39;t share a photo of mine or of someone fooling around,&quot; he says.
The young boy recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, of naked people, of crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine followers on Twitter.
The majority are family.
His mother is one of them, she knows the password for one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
&quot;I don&#39;t know if they answer me, I just post them,&quot; he adds.
&quot;Social media is fun, I can talk with distant relatives or with my friends, in a quick way,&quot; he says.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He also won&#39;t trust anyone who recommends a stranger to him.
The case of José, 14, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter he admits not knowing 20 of the people on his friends list.
&quot;It doesn&#39;t worry me because we have something in common, like music,&quot; he says.
According to the young boy, no one made advances to him or asked for his address or telephone number.
&quot;If they pressured me or demanded it, I would just remove them from my account,&quot; he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today as cyberbullying are not foreign to the young boy.
A relative of one of my friends was extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
&quot;He never knew who it was,&quot; he says.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
&quot;He only put it on a private profile.&quot;
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account in a secure way.
Unlike Jorge, this youngster would post photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or pissed off.
&quot;Even though I know it&#39;s cyberbullying,&quot; he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, considers that, to guide children and adolescents, we must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
&quot;The Internet has emerged as a means of seeking information, but with the appearance of these sites, the rules of the game have changed&quot;, she mentions.
Porras points out that academician Marc Prensky, who has a master&#39;s degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book &quot;Digital Natives and Immigrants&quot;, uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are children and young people who are born with technology.
&quot;We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we ourselves are learning,&quot; she says.
He adds that the subject is complex, &quot;because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what should or should not be disclosed, published or said at an age when they do not have the necessary maturity for the TO DO&quot;.
&quot;We also ask them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,&quot; she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
&quot;Telling them not to do it is useless,&quot; she says.
Then Porras lists some examples: there are things you wouldn&#39;t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a picture of you like a friend&#39;s picture you posted?
Do you know what others post about you?
When you tag party photos, do you ask other people for permission to tag them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you&#39;re doing at all times?
Another point is to make them understand that they should act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
&quot;Off the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks,&quot; she says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational adviser, says that it is essential that parents carefully read the conditions of use of social networks.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or posted,” he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children not to talk to strangers.
The Unasur summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 representatives present.
Efe tried several times to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially signaled that it would be released after the closing of the summit, then claimed that it would be published at any time on the Peruvian government&#39;s website.
When asked about the text, they pointed out that its contents had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists&#39; access to information about the summit was constantly restricted.
During the day, only the video without sound of the presidential assembly with the message &quot;private session, audio restricted&quot; was broadcast in the press room.
The little information circulating between the journalists was that given by the press attachés of some of the Unasur governments who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more important information.
Later, Peru&#39;s presidency sent an email to the media with the &quot;final declaration&quot; of the summit, but it was President Humala&#39;s speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd South American-Arab Countries (ASPA) Summit and, on this occasion, although it had been urgently requested by the press, it also did not broadcast the declaration also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official ASPA website, you can verify that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to set up secure transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited the obtaining of information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment from the Court of The Hague which settles a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and said they would respect the decision of the ICJ to hear the arguments of both sides in the trial that Lima has brought against Santiago and which begins Monday in The Hague.
&quot;We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes that we bring today before this international court,&quot; said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
&quot;Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of controversies, international treaties and tribunals,&quot; President Piñera added, shaking hands with President Humala, alongside flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia this week denounced the Pact of Bogota by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of this international tribunal, after a decision on the maritime limits with Nicaragua, which she considered to be seriously wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its ex-president Fernando Lugo, did not take part in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was tasked with opening deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been set between the South American countries for a total of 17 million dollars of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the Unasur countries would take “important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits”.
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve &quot;cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and against international organized crime, actions for better accessibility to medicines, access to the Internet at low cost in the whole of South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters&quot;.
With a Europe in crisis, &quot;the economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to glimpse a better future for our populations&quot;, concluded President Humala.
&quot;We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits&quot;, said said the Peruvian president during a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were on the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, although it did not have no further details were given.
Likewise, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
&quot;We hope that the electoral process of this country will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations&quot;, from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and with good relations with its neighbours, was another theme discussed at the summit.
In this sense, the Colombian President, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before starting the regional appointment, that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through of an ICJ judgment requested by Bogota.
“It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,” President Santos said.
&quot;We are going to revise all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua which will require having a discussion with this country&quot;, he underlined.
&quot;I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we are going to settle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,&quot; added President Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico City on Saturday, where they plan to witness the inauguration of that country&#39;s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, within the framework of the summit, the bloc&#39;s defense ministers will meet beforehand to approve the Action Plan for the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defense in the region. .
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter country be suspended.
Peru holds the presidency pro tempore of the regional bloc.
&quot;South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship&quot;, declares Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which &quot;South America, in this case, must take an example from Europe&quot;.
President Correa, who took part in the VI summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, declared on state television, TV Peru, that the Europeans &quot;had killed each other during the World War II&quot; and in other conflicts, &quot;but that they were now almost a homeland&quot;.
In this sense, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship promoted by the member countries of Unasur.
&quot;We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong in the past,&quot; he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian president showed himself in favor of the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the objective of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account the signatories of the Pact of San José on human rights.
Those who beat us to it never compromise anything, conversely, we South Americans have all signed it.
&quot;It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington with funding from the United States,&quot; he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself did not betray his principles, but on the contrary he respected his &quot;deep democratic and human rights values&quot;.
He concluded that at the time &quot;there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected&quot;.
In addition, he criticizes the Swedish justice system which demanded that he submit to an interrogation on its territory concerning an alleged sexual offense while &quot;Swedish own legislation allows this to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the embassy. from Ecuador to London&quot;.
Correa claimed there was a risk that Assange&#39;s mental and physical health would deteriorate.
&quot;I haven&#39;t spoken to him since he&#39;s been in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious,&quot; said the Ecuadorian president.
It is possible that his physical and mental health will deteriorate from being confined in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
&quot;It affects anyone&#39;s health,&quot; he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the granting of a safe-conduct that would allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities and he underlines that he had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We don&#39;t negotiate with human rights, we don&#39;t use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
&quot;The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange&#39;s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of procedures with different European authorities&quot;, he mentioned.
And he thinks that &quot;if Britain granted safe conduct tomorrow, it would be over&quot;.
And if Sweden, as its legislation fully permits, and as it has already done in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and he clarified that what he did not tolerate was &quot;mediocrity, bad faith and lies that undermine freedom of expression&quot;.
&quot;The greatest enemies of press freedom are not malicious or perverse politicians but bad journalists in the pay of greed, blackmail and extortion,&quot; he said.
From this angle, he congratulated himself that it was not this kind of journalists &quot;neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate in Ecuador&quot; and, rather than highlighting his re-election, &quot;he would deepen the revolution for continue the path and chart the right course&quot;.
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto over Paraguay within Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization &quot;must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup attempts disguised states&quot; because in reality &quot;it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy&quot;.
Moreover, the Ecuadorian president considers as &quot;perfectly relevant&quot; the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime limits between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, this which will strengthen Nicaragua&#39;s maritime sovereignty.
For the moment, this judgment is not respected.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
They must be resolved as a whole in order to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the successful resolution of the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile in the same tribunal and affirmed that it is &quot;beneficial that Latin America seizes the international bodies if the two countries agree to accept a judgment, however firm it may be&quot;.
Referring to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate in future presidential elections in Ecuador, with a view to running for a third consecutive term, he indicated that he saw this possibility &quot;with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult.
Correa assured that if he lost the primaries in February 2013, he would retire from public life.
On a personal level, power has never interested me, but in situations as unjust as those in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
&quot;My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this eventual victory but we must accept this responsibility,&quot; he said.
If I win, it would be my last presidential term and I will then retire from political life.
If we ever lose, I will too.
&quot;It&#39;s my decision,&quot; he said.
Correa also referred to Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez&#39;s new medical treatment in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
&quot;This does not mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez&quot;, he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State took part today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for better regional integration in order to to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths today are due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when the test result was confirmed to him: HIV positive.
&quot;It&#39;s as if the sky has fallen on my head,&quot; he said, referring to the moment of the announcement, which the doctor had tried to make &quot;less painful&quot;, in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take charge of his disease alone and began to learn about it and his relentlessness was such that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is, without a doubt, one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 90s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye &quot;because he was speechless&quot;.
In those days, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, unaware of their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, &quot;exhausted&quot; their immune system and fall victim to opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first reported cases, &quot;the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same&quot;, indicated the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he takes as a reference that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious disease specialist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a fatal disease, but that the number of years of survival and the quality of life depend on the level of immune system impairment that patients exhibited at diagnosis, with better prospects for those not using drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 count of 200 and up to 50 years for those reaching a CD4 count of 200. count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, this means that for someone who is diagnosed with HIV positive at age 25, &quot;as long as it remains under control, can live without problems until age 75&quot;, explained the scientist interviewed.
In order to place this progress in context, it should be noted that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico the number of people dying from AIDS has fallen from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the annual report of UNAIDS), but it is also true that since the appearance of AIDS, 60% of the patients listed on the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I think the problem is not access to treatment.
That&#39;s how I see it, that&#39;s what happened in our hospital.
Over the last 12 years at least, we have never run out of drugs, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
He gives us an indisputable fact &quot;nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what is needed to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, for that , we must offer screening tests on a massive scale, to all those who request them”.
Specialists and members of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as do the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who had to take his screening test in a private laboratory , simply because a friend had done it and, despite his young age, he was already a carrier of AIDS and suffered from Kaposi&#39;s sarcoma, a cancerous tumor which is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you find out you have AIDS.
Some think they are going to die and don&#39;t want to know.
&quot;If I&#39;m going to die, it&#39;s better that I have fun three times a week&quot;, they say, this is not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he has cancer.
I have a normal life, like everyone else.
&quot;I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active but co-responsible sex life, I pay attention to myself and to the other person&quot;, says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the World AIDS Day march.
Let them take the test, if they took risks, the sooner they know if they are HIV-positive the better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they must know that we can live like everyone else, by being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, argues Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest is prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, &quot;we have effectively increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packs of a hundred, that&#39;s very good, but the result is that even today, some do not have access to condoms,&quot; he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: &quot;What are you going to do with it?&quot;, posed with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents do not don&#39;t want to hear, assures the journalist.
He proposes to redirect this inefficient distribution; that condoms not only be sold at counters, but that they are found in vending machines in public toilets and in places frequented by young people.
This is not to encourage promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying them the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
&quot;That&#39;s not how sexuality works, the best thing is to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active,&quot; he stressed.
The numbers in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state is the 4th state in the country in number of new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in the number of HIV patients.
92% of contaminations are sexual, 6% blood and 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each registered case, there are 4 or 5 people who are unaware of it.
A judgment ratified on appeal by a United States court ignores the restructuring of Vitro Group&#39;s debt granted through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario sets a bad precedent for all national companies with branches in neighboring countries and with solvency problems.
It therefore seems that the procedures for survival of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country with the stars and stripes, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment handed down on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies defenseless against the possibility of an embargo of their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico&#39;s leading glass maker to sue the US Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge in the case points out that creditors must register under United States bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting in New Orleans, affirms that the procedure main one is the commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
Indeed, the United Nations Model Law for Uniformity in International Commercial Law was created for this purpose with the American Law Institute as arbiter.
Second, the judgment establishes that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by Vitro&#39;s subsidiaries towards the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have be obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There are half a dozen examples here, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcy.
Furthermore, what is certain is that, since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, in any case the creditors of Vitro who fought against this in the courts of the United States, that is to say the funds &quot;vulture&quot; like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
A data omitted by the appeal court.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation it had been facing since 2008 without stopping at the severe economic crisis that the United States was facing, passing the costs on to the country.
For the moment, the company of the González Sada family will appeal to the same appeal court so that the vote takes place in its entirety, that is to say with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance remedy will claim non-prosperity and requires review of the lawsuit by a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
Most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the court&quot;) detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the bankruptcy law commercial, pointing out that this freed him from the agreements signed by the two countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States bankruptcy law.
In addition, he points out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is to say the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.
Two-sided pileup: they knock out Vitro and they knock out the country.
General assessment
The complaints of the unions of the Mexican Society of Aviation against the former boss of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were ignored for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Syndicale des Pilotes Aviateurs has already encountered problems.
The body, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just presented a criminal claim against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied having provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to withdraw from the F/589 trust of the IXE bank 198 million pesos in the name of Mexicana de Aviation.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They besiege the Dragon Mart
Gathered over the weekend in an amphitheater at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society endorsed the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the Great Wall, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in uniting the governors of the South-East zone in order to oppose the monumental project which is partly in protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead
The government has put forward a senate demand to explain under what terms and circumstances Mexico&#39;s ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual property, this theme is already ancient history.
As everyone knows, this was done although the senate itself condemned this possibility, because it was considered an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Long Term Homex
In an effort to pay long-term debts without affecting short-term ones, property developer Homex went public on the Stock Exchange for 500 million pesos.
This issue of securities is the first of four issues for which they propose to pay interest every 28 days.
Birth of Competitive
Integrated by the companies NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leaders in IT, a new consortium with the corporate name Competival has just been born, whose objective will be the market for clustering software services in Central and South America .
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes &quot;Basketball is my whole life&quot;
Basketball globetrotter &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in connection with the court and, thanks to it, has traveled all over the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as much knowledge of local basketball history as Héctor “Hetin” Reyes.
The reason is that before a cerebral hemorrhage condemned him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower league player, team player national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or as president of the basketball federation.
&quot;I have worn many hats in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, such as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the years 90,&quot; Reyes recalled during a visit from Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife of more than 50 years.
“Basketball is my whole life”.
Reyes is not exaggerating when he makes this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that recall his extraordinary itinerary, bear witness to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he loves the most are those that remind him of his time as a player with the Vaqueros team in the mid-1950s until 1982, after spending 15 years as co-manager. or team manager.
&quot;Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
That&#39;s a lot of satisfying years, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired during the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy entered the BSN team.
From there, &#39;Cuco&#39; Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took charge of the team,&quot; said Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been a manager here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: &quot;I have a strong player for you, he is two meters tall.
You want it ?&quot;
That&#39;s how Mincy started, one of Puerto Rico&#39;s best players.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse was going to help us try to win another one.
He was delighted with the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only from a distance since in 1988 he was already the big boss of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his charges and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 Worlds, where we came in 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if that Canadian judge hadn&#39;t made us replay the last game, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you&#39;ve seen?
She is one of the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we beat the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won bronze at the Worlds .
This team was not only made up of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and &quot;Piculín&quot; (Ortiz), there were also the youngsters (Javier) &quot;Toñito&quot; Colón and James Carter, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar ) and Mario &quot;Quijote&quot; Morales, who was unable to attend the 90 World Cup due to a knee problem.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy in the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén in Argentina.
With players like &quot;Canito&quot; Nieves, Pablo Alicea and youngster Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was Puerto Rico&#39;s best player?
Undoubtedly, it is Piculín Ortiz.
His statistics at international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level like Piculín has.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the various leagues for which he played.
Who has been the best Puerto Rican leader?
It&#39;s very difficult to say!
We had a good team made up of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I really like the work that Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest achievement within the federation?
Being part of the national team&#39;s most glorious era between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s BSN had as many as 17 teams in a season.
What&#39;s left for you to do?
There are things I would have liked to put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, the boys of Ponce play only in their zone and only face teams from other corners of the island during the national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when it is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for managers, field staff and referees.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch clips from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and once in a while I go to basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became known worldwide for the main role of John Ross Ewing, better known as JR, in the television series &quot;Dallas&quot;, in which he embodied an unscrupulous, fearsome and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil tycoon JR Ewing on the television series &quot;Dallas&quot; became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as JR in a new season of &quot;Dallas,&quot; died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for the Warner Bros., home of &quot;Dallas&quot; production.
&quot;Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again playing the ironic role he loved the most,&quot; the family said.
Larry&#39;s family and close friends were with him in Dallas on the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, his publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
&quot;He was an exceptional person and he lived life to the fullest,&quot; Gray said in a statement.
Doctors diagnosed Larry Hagman with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he admitted to drinking heavily for many years.
In 1995 he was diagnosed with a malignant liver tumor and underwent a transplant.
Several years before &quot;Dallas&quot;, Hagman had made a name for himself on television as an ordinary guy in the series &quot;Jinny of my dreams&quot; broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, &quot;The Good Life&quot; (NBC, 1971-72) and &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; (ABC, 1973).
His film roles include critically acclaimed roles in &#39;The Band&#39;, &#39;Harry and Tonto&#39; and &#39;Primary Colors&#39;.
But it was thanks to his masterful portrayal of the deliciously detestable JR that Larry Hagman achieved his greatest success.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and their relatives aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan &quot;Who Killed JR?&quot;, coined to keep the suspense going around an emotionally charged episode in which Hagman&#39;s character is nearly murdered, has generated worldwide speculation and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record rating at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers were in front of their screens and made &quot;Dallas&quot; the second most-watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of &quot;MASH &quot; in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was JR&#39;s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to charge her with prostitution if she didn&#39;t leave town, but other people also had reason to assault her.
Hagman played Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest contractor and unfaithful husband who tried to commit his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
&quot;I know what it would take for an epitaph for JR,&quot; Hagman said in 1988.
It should read: &quot;Here lies Honest Citizen JR Ewing.&quot;
This is the only game he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as &quot;a huge man, both on the small screen and in life.&quot;
He is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of all of us who were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of &quot;Dallas&quot; were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes has already been completed for the second season and a sixth is in progress, the channel informed.
For the moment, neither Warner nor the TNT channel have communicated on how Hagman&#39;s death will be integrated into the series.
Hailing from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who rose to fame with classic works like &quot;South Pacific&quot; and &quot;Peter Pan.&quot;
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 while married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the stages of New York theaters in the early 1950s and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California town of Malibu, home to many celebrities.
In 2001, he titled his memoir &quot;Hello Darlin&#39;: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life&quot;
&quot;I haven&#39;t written anything in this book that could hurt anyone or affect them in any way,&quot; he told reporters at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist worried patients.
&quot;I advise them, I restore their confidence, I come with them when they come to have surgery and after,&quot; he said in 1996.
I try to offer them some reassurance, like, &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid, it won&#39;t be easy for a little while, but it&#39;s going to be okay.&quot;
He was also an anti-tobacco activist and participated in several campaigns.
A lesson dealing with the &quot;End of the world&quot; has just started
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew he was throwing an irresistible hook: the end of the &quot;great countdown&quot; of the Mayan calendar, on December 21, to which refer many people as proof of the imminent end of the world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the following months: catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal sinkhole that some have dubbed &quot;the Armageddon of debt&quot; and a growing conflict involving Israel, the where Christian end-time theorists believed the apocalypse would begin.
&quot;I didn&#39;t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I&#39;ve ever had,&quot; Professor Charmé told his students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were telling it, it was a very good time.
And we must remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he is not the only professor to give courses on &quot;the end of the world&quot; this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker teaches the course &quot;Media, Culture and the End of the World&quot;.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and the way they offer what-if scenarios guides some human conduct.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and explore how they compare with real-life examples.
&quot;I tried to educate my students on what was possible, probable, believable and impossible,&quot; Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply titled &quot;The End of the World&quot;.
&quot;We&#39;re adding &#39;2012&#39; to have the option of running the course again, in case the world doesn&#39;t go away,&quot; Professor Restall said.
Despite the &quot;imminent disaster&quot;, students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be taken the day before the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work &quot;until the very night of the supposed end of the world&quot;, a declared Restall.
The courses have proven to be quite popular.
“It was sold out in two hours,” Restall said of his high-level student course, made up of 35 students.
We received email messages several weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there was still room.
The students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves,” says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religion and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden University.
For doomsday fear, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old Psychology and Nursing student, claims to have watched all the apocalyptic films.
“I had never heard of a course that taught this subject,” he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone a professor, told us they believed in the end of the world date of December 21.
“Our first project was about Mayan prophecy, and in a way we discredited it,” says Julie Zegle, a 21-year-old final-year Temple student from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it was just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I concede that there is apocalypse-related anxiety in Western culture, dating back centuries, that causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom in such speculation.
&quot;In other parts of the world, people don&#39;t think about that,&quot; he says.
This is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a La Salle University religion professor who is teaching classes in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he was aware of the &quot;end of the world&quot; classes being taught here.
“The Philippines are not part of the end of the world,” he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall points out that over the years there has been talk of many supposed doomsday dates, and he claims that if nothing happens on December 21, &quot;people will immediately start thinking about the next date&quot; or philosophizing. that December 21 marks the beginning of a 7-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Several told us that they were thinking of going to &quot;end of the world&quot; parties.
&quot;Sometimes I call friends and we laugh about it together,&quot; commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
