It's a story about how we know what we know.
It's a story about this woman Natalia Rybczynski.
She's a paleobiologist, which means she's a specialist in digging old dead stuff.
Natalia Rybczynski: Yes, sometimes, I was called "Dr. Dead Choses."
Latif Nasser: I think it's interesting because of where it works, well above the Arctic Circle in Canada's isolated tundra.
One summer day in 2006, she was at a dig site called Fyles Leaf Bed, which is less than 10 degrees latitude from the magnetic north pole.
NR: Frankly, it doesn't look exciting, because it was a day's walk with a backpack, a GPS and a notebook, and we picked up anything that could be a fossil.
LN: And at some point, she noticed something.
NR: Riff, rusty, rusty, tall as the palm of my hand.
He was just standing on the floor.
LN: And at first, she thought it was just a splinter, like the ones found at the Fyles Leaf Bed before-the-shelf bits of prehistoric plants.
But that night, back to the camp, ...
NR: ... I take a magnifying glass, I look at it more closely and I realize that it doesn't have the growth rings of a tree.
Maybe it's its preservation, but it really looks like...
a bone.
LN: So over the next four years, she returned to this place many times, and eventually she collected 30 fragments of the same bone, most of them very small.
NR: That's not that much. It fits into a little plastic bag.
LN: And she tried to assemble them like a puzzle.
But it was stimulating.
NR: It's all broken in so many small pieces, I try with sand and mastic, but to no avail.
So finally, we used a 3D surface scanner.
LN: Ooh. NR: Yes, exactly.
LN: But it was easier to do it virtually.
NR: It's a little magical when everything comes together.
LN: How did you know it was good, that they were assembled properly?
Was it possible to assemble them differently to have a parakeet or something else?
NR: Uh, no. No, it could only do that.
LN: She found that what she had was a tibia, a leg bone, and precisely the bone to a forked hoof mammal, so something like a cow or a sheep.
But it couldn't be one of those.
It was just too big.
NR: The size of this thing was huge. It's a very large animal.
LN: So what animal could be?
In the impasse, she showed one of the fragments to her colleagues in Colorado, and they had an idea.
NR: We took a saw, and we just cut the edge, and there was this very interesting smell that escaped.
LN: It smelled like sniffish flesh.
It was a smell that Natalia recognized after cutting a lot of skulls into her disgusting anatomy lab: collagen.
Collagen is what gives our bones their structure.
And in general, after so many years, it decomposes.
But in this case, the Arctic had acted like a natural freezer and retained it.
Then, a year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol, and she saw that one of her colleagues, Mike Buckley, was presenting a new method called the "collagen imprint."
It turns out that all species have slightly different collagen structures, so if we have the profile of the collagen of an unknown bone, it can be compared with that of known species, and, who knows, maybe they match.
So she sent him one of the fragments, by FedEx.
NR: Yeah, we wanted to follow him. It was quite important
LN: He studied it, and compared it to 37 known modern mammalian species.
And he found a match.
It turns out that the 3.5 million-year-old bone that Natalia unearthed from the High Arctic belonged to...
a camel.
NR: And I was like, "That's great -- if it's true." ”
LN: They tested several fragments and they had the same result each time.
However, based on the size of the bone they had found, this camel appeared to be 30% larger than modern camels.
So this camel would have been almost 2.8 feet long, and weighed almost a ton.
And yes.
Natalia had found a giant Arctic camel.
Now, when you hear the word "camel," what should come to your mind is one of those, the camel of East Bactria and Central Asia.
But you may have in mind a postcard image like this, the camel, the typical desert animal -- that lives in the sands of hot places, like the Middle East or the Sahara, with a big bump on his back where it stores water for its mehares, and with big, wide feet that help it climb the sand dunes.
So how do we explain that one of them ended up in the High Arctic?
In fact, scientists had long known, even before Natalia's discovery, that camels were originally American.
They started here.
For 40 of the 45 million years since camels have existed, it could be found that in North America, about 20 different species, perhaps more.
If we line them all up, would we see differences?
NR: Yes, the bodies will have different sizes.
You're going to have some with very long necks, which will actually be like giraffes.
LN: Some had mouths, like crocodiles.
NR: The most primitive would have been very small, almost like rabbits.
LN: What? Camels the size of a rabbit?
NR: The oldest.
So probably you wouldn't recognize them.
LN: Damn it, I want a rabbit-chameau.
NR: I know, that would be great.
LN: And three to seven million years ago, a branch of camels went down to South America, where they became llamas and alpacas, and another branch crossed the Bering land language to Asia and Africa.
And at the end of the last ice age, North American camels went out.
So scientists already knew all of this, but it doesn't really explain why Natalia found such a far north from it.
Because, in terms of temperature, it's exactly the opposite of the Sahara.
To be frank, 3 and a half million years ago, the average temperature was 22 degrees Celsius warmer than today.
So there would have been a boreal forest, more like the Yukon or Siberia today.
But anyway, they would have had winters that lasted six months during which the ponds were frozen.
There would have been blizzards.
There would have been 24-hour days completely in darkness.
So, how... How?
How is it possible that one of these Sahara superstars can survive in this Arctic environment?
Natalia and her colleagues believe they have an answer.
And it's kind of awesome.
What if the characteristics that make the camel so fit to places like the Sahara, had in fact evolved to help it endure the winter?
What if these wide feet were made, not to walk on sand, but in the snow, like a pair of rackets?
What if this bump -- which, by the way, big news for me, contains no water, but fat -- was there to help the camel withstand these six-month-old winters, when food is scarce?
And then, only later, after crossing the land bridge, he used these features to adapt them to burning deserts?
For example, the bump can be useful for camels for desert climates because having all their fat in the same place, like a backpack of fat, means they don't have this insulating layer on the rest of the body.
So the heat dissipates more easily.
It is this crazy idea, which the attributes of the camel that prove, in our view, its desert nature may in fact be proof of its past in the Arctic.
So I'm not the first to tell this story.
Some have spoken of this in order to embellish the biology of evolution or to give an overview of the future of climate change.
But I love him for any other reason.
For me, it's a story about us, about how we see the world and how it changes.
I have a history degree.
And I've learned that a lot of scientists are also historians.
They give meaning to the past.
They tell the story of our universe, our planet, our planet life.
And as a historian, we start with a certain idea of the course of the story.
NR: We make stories and that's it, like the camel in the desert.
It's a great story. She fits well with the idea.
They've apparently still lived there.
LN: But at any time, you can find a tiny bit of evidence.
We can learn a tiny little thing that's going to force us to review everything we thought we knew.
For example, in this case, there's a scientist who finds this shrapnel thinking it's a piece of wood, and because of that, science has a totally new and really counterintuitive theory that shows why this creature, appearing to come out of the drawings of Dr. Seuss, is as it is.
And for me, it completely changed the way I see the camel.
It's gone from being that ridiculous creature only adapted to a specific environment, to this great traveller who has just arrived in the Sahara, and who could theoretically arrive anywhere.
This is Azuri.
Azuri, hi, how are you doing?
Okay, here, I have this for you.
Azuri is on vacation, usually at his concerts at Radio City Music Hall.
It's not even a joke.
Anyway -- Azuri is here as living proof, to remind us that the history of our world is dynamic.
Only our will can help us to readjust it, to reinvent it.
Isn't that right, Azuri?
And really, we're all at a bone to see the world differently.
Thank you very much.
Today's computers are so amazing that you don't realize how bad they are.
Today I'd like to talk to you about this problem and how we can solve it with neuroscience.
First of all, I'd like to take you back to Harlem on a monocytal night in 2011 that struck me deeply.
I was sitting at a bar not far from Columbia University, where I was studying computer science and neuroscience and I was in a big conversation with another student about the ability of holograms to replace computers one day.
As we get to the best time of the conversation, of course, his phone lights up.
He sorts it out, looks at it and starts typing something.
Then he forces his eyes back on me and he says, "Go on." I'm listening to you. ”
But of course, his eyes were absent, and the time had passed.
Meanwhile, in that bar, I saw another student holding his phone, this time to a group.
He was scrolling around photos on Instagram, and these kids were laughing hysterically.
This dichotomy between my feeling of unease and the joy they felt about the same technology made me wonder.
The more I thought about it, the more I realized that here, the problem was clearly not digital information, it was only the position of use that separated me from my friend and that brought these kids together.
They were connected around something just like our ancestors who improved their social knowledge by telling stories around the campfire.
I think that's exactly what the tools should do.
Extending our bodies.
I think computers are doing the opposite today.
Whether you send an email to your wife, whether you compose a symphony, or you're consoliating a friend, you do it in much the same way.
You're leaning over these rectangles, you tap on buttons, menus and more rectangles.
I think that's the wrong way. I think we can start using a more natural machine.
We should use machines that bring our work back into this world.
Machines that use the principles of neuroscience to prolong our senses, not go against them.
It turns out that I actually have such a machine.
Her name is Meta 2.
Let's test it.
In front of me, I can see an audience, and I can see my hands.
And in three, two, one, we're going to see an immersive hologram appear, a very realistic hologram appears in front of me, from the glasses I'm wearing.
Of course, this could be something that we buy or learn, and I can use my hands to move them finely.
I think Iron Man would be proud.
We'll come back to that a little later.
Now if you're like me, your mind is already in the recess of the possibilities that we have with this kind of technology, let's look at some of them.
My mother is an architect, of course the first thing I imagined was to draw a building in 3D instead of using these 2D shots.
There, it touches graphics and selects an interior decor.
Everything was filmed with a GoPro with our own glasses.
This next case is really special for me, it's Professor Adam Gazzaley's brain glasses project, provided by UCSF.
As a neuroscience student, I'll always fantasize about the possibility of learning and memorizing these complex brain structures with a real machine, I could touch and play with these different brain structures.
What you see now is called augmented reality, but for me, it's part of a much more important story -- a story about how we start to expand our bodies through digital objects, rather than the other way around.
Now...
I think that in the next few years, humanity will experience change.
We're going to start putting a whole layer of digital information on the real world.
Imagine for a moment what it would mean for storytellers, painters, neurosurgeons, interior designers and maybe for all of us here today.
And what we need to do as a community is to try and make the effort to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that expands the human experience, rather than ludifying our reality or cluttering it with digital information.
That's what I'm really passionate about.
Now I want to tell you a little secret.
In about five years -- it's not the smallest device -- in about five years, they'll all look like glass strips on our eyes that will project holograms.
Since little attention is paid to the phone that we buy for its technical features -- you buy it for the operating system -- as a neuroscientist, I've always dreamed of creating "the iOS of the mind," if you will.
It's very, very important to do things right, because we could live in these things for at least as long as the time spent with the Windows user interface.
And I don't know you, but living inside Windows scares me.
To isolate the most intuitive interface from infinity, we use neuroscience to create our design principles, rather than a bunch of designers competing in a meeting.
The principle on which we all rely is what is called the "Faultless Neural Way". ”
Each time, we try to connect the iOS of our brain with our brain according to, for the very first time, our conditions.
In other words, we're trying to create a computer without a learning curve.
We're building a system that you've always been using.
This is the first of three principles that we use in this brand new user experience.
First of all, you're the operating system.
Conventional file systems are complex and abstract, requiring more steps from your brain to decode them.
We would run into the Neural Path of Plus Low Resistance.
Meanwhile, in augmented reality, you put your TED holographic panel right there, and your holographic email on the other side of the office, and your evolved spatial memory recovers them.
You could put your holographic Tesla that you buy -- or any model that my legal team told me to put on.
Perfect. Your brain knows exactly how to get it back.
We call the second interface principle “Touch to see”.
What do babies do when they see something that attracts attention?
They're trying to reach it, to touch it.
That's exactly how the natural machine should walk.
It turns out that the visual system has an essential boost in a sense called proprioception -- it's the sense of the limbs of our body in space.
By directly touching our work, we will not only better control it, but we will also better understand it.
And so, touch to see.
But it's not enough to feel things.
We are intrinsically social primates.
This brings me to our third principle, the holographic campfire of our first story.
Our mirror neuron system suggests that we can better connect with each other and with our work if we can see our faces and hands in 3D.
So if you look at the video behind me, you can see two Meta users playing with the same hologram, making eye contact, connected around that object, instead of being distracted by external devices.
Let's continue and try again with neuroscience in mind.
Again, our favorite interface, the iOS of the mind.
I'm now going to go further and grab this pair of glasses and leave it here next to the office.
I'm with you, right now, we're connected.
My space memory has turned on, and I can catch it and put it back here, remembering that I'm the operating system.
And my proprioception is on, and I can go on and explode these glasses in thousands of pieces and touch the sensor that is scanning my hand.
But that's not enough to see the objects alone, in a second, co-founder Ray is going to phone 3D -- Ray?
Hi Ray, how are you?
I can see this person entirely in front of me in 3D.
And it's pretty realistic.
Thank you.
My mirror neuron system suggests that this is going to replace phones in a short time.
Ray, how are you doing?
Ray: All right. We're live today.
MG: Ray, give the audience a gift from the holographic brain that we saw earlier.
This will not only replace phones, but it will also change the way we work together.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Ray.
Ray: Nothing.
MG: Okay, here's the message I discovered in a bar in 2011: the future of computers isn't blocked inside one of these screens.
He's right there, in us.
If there's only one idea I can give today, it's that the natural machine is not the fruit of the future, it's right here in 2016.
That's why we all in Meta, including administrative staff, executives, designers, engineers -- before TED2017, we're all going to put our external monitors in the trash and replace them with really, more natural machines.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, that's very nice.
Thank you all.
Chris Anderson: Okay, explain one thing to me, because there were few demonstrations about augmented reality last year or earlier here.
And sometimes there's a debate among technologists about whether we're really seeing the real object on the screen.
This is a field of vision problem. In a way, the technology shows a wider view than the one you should see when wearing the glasses.
Have we seen real life?
MG: Absolutely real life.
And not only that, we took other steps to film with a GoPro with the real lenses, the different videos broadcast.
We want to try to simulate the experience of the world that we see through the glasses, and not cut any passage.
CA: Thank you very much for this presentation.
MG: Thank you very much, it was a pleasure.
I come from one of the most liberal, tolerant, progressive places in the United States: Seattle, in Washington.
I grew up with a family of great Seattelites.
My mother was an artist, my father a professor at university, and I'm grateful for my childhood, because I've always been completely comfortable living my life as I saw fit.
In fact, I took a path that wasn't the one my parents had imagined.
When I was 19, I dropped out of college -- abandoned, fired, cutting hair in four.
I went on tour as a professional horn player, which was my lifelong dream.
I played chamber music across the United States and Europe, I was two years touring with a great jazz player: Charlie Bird.
Giving away from my 30 years, I finished a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra.
What a life.
My parents never complained.
They supported me all along.
It wasn't their dream.
They said to their neighbors and friends, "Our son takes a sabbatical decade. ”
And -- There was, however, an embarrassing conversation about my lifestyle that I'd like to talk to you about.
I was 27 years old, I had come back from Barcelona, I was at my parents' house for Christmas, I was preparing dinner with my mother and we were alone in the kitchen.
And she was silent, too silent.
Something was wrong.
I said, "Mom, what are you thinking?" ”
She said, "Your father and I are worried about you." ”
I said, "What? What could it be?
And she said, "I want you to be completely honest: Did you vote Republican?" ”
In fact, I wasn't very political, I was just a horn player.
I had an epiphany, they had perceived it, and it was confusing.
I had become an enthusiast of capitalism and I want to explain to you what it is.
This was born out of the interest I have always had for, believe it or not, poverty.
When I was a kid, growing up in Seattle, I remember the first time I saw real poverty.
We were a family at the bottom of the middle class, but, of course, it's not real poverty.
That is a long way off.
The first time I saw poverty and his face, I was six or seven years old in the early 1970s.
And, as with many of you, it was a prosaic and mundane example.
It was a photograph in National Geographic of a child my age in eastern Africa, there were flies on his face and a distended belly.
He wasn't going to get away with it, I knew it, and I was helpless.
Some of you remember this image, not exactly this one, but a similar one.
It has revealed the danger of abject poverty to the West.
This vision haunted me as I grew up, went to school, dropped out, did something else and founded a family.
And I was wondering what happened to that child
or others like him all over the world.
I studied, even though I wasn't in college, I was looking for an answer: What happened to the world's poorest people?
Was it getting worse, was it getting better? What?
I found the answer and it changed my life, and I want to share it with you.
See -- most Americans believe that poverty has worsened since our childhood since they saw this picture.
Ask Americans how poverty in the world has changed, 70 percent will say that global hunger has worsened since the early 1970s.
But here's the truth.
This is the epiphany that changed my way of thinking.
Between the 1970s and now, the percentage of the world's population living in famine, living on less than one dollar a day, adjusted for inflation, fell by 80 per cent.
There has been an 80 percent decline in the world's most severe poverty since my childhood.
And I didn't even know that.
This, my friends, is a miracle.
We must celebrate it.
It's the greatest anti-poverty achievement in human history, and it's happening in our lifetime.
When I learned this, I asked, what did that do, made it possible?
Because if you don't know why, you can't do it again.
If you want to do it again and get out of poverty the next two billion, because that's what we're talking about: since my childhood, two billion of those, our brothers and sisters, have come out of poverty.
I want the next two billion, so I need to know why.
I looked for an answer.
She wasn't political, because I didn't care.
I always don't care.
I wanted the best answer from traditional economists on the left, right and center.
Here it is.
Here are the reasons.
These are the five reasons why two billion of our brothers and sisters have been lifted out of poverty since I was a child.
The first is globalization.
The second is free trade.
The third is property rights.
The fourth: the rule of law.
The fifth: entrepreneurship.
It was the system of free enterprise spreading around the world after 1970 that did that.
I'm not naive.
I know that free enterprise is not perfect and that free enterprise is not enough to build a better world.
But she's awesome.
And it goes beyond politics.
This is what I learned, my epiphany.
Capitalism is not just a matter of accumulation.
Its main asset is aspiration, which is what many people talk about on this stage, the aspiration that comes from dreams embedded in the system of free enterprise.
We need to share it with more people.
I want to talk to you about a second epiphany that is linked to the first and that can bring us progress, not only in the world but also at home.
The best quote I've heard to sum up the thoughts I just mentioned to get people out of poverty is this: "Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history.
They lifted billions of people out of poverty. ”
Who said that?
It looks like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
That's not true.
President Barack Obama said so.
Why do I know her by heart?
Because he was addressing me.
It's crazy.
And I said, "Hallelujah. ”
But, more than that, I said, "What an opportunity. ”
You know what I was thinking?
I was at an event on this topic at Georgetown University in May 2015.
And I thought this was the solution to America's biggest problem today. What is he?
It's about coming together around these liberal and conservative ideas to help those who need them most.
There is no need to tell you that we are in crisis, in America and in many countries in the politically polarized world.
This has reached a critical level of crisis.
It's unpleasant. It's not fair.
Last year, there was an article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which is one of the most prestigious scientific journals in the West.
It was a 2014 article on the asymmetry of political motivations.
What is it? Psychologists call this the phenomenon of presumption that your ideology is based on love but that your opponent's ideology is based on hatred.
It is common in a global conflict.
You expect, for example, to see it between Palestinians and Israelis.
What the authors of this article have discovered is that today in America, a majority of Republicans and Democrats suffer from asymmetry in political motivations.
Today, a majority of politically active people think they are motivated by love, but the other party is motivated by hatred.
Think about it. Think about it.
Most people say, "My ideology is based on fundamental benevolence, I want to help people, but the others are demonic and want me to hurt. ”
Society cannot progress when there is this kind of asymmetry.
It's impossible.
How do we solve that?
First, let's be honest: there are differences.
Let us not minimize differences. That would be naive.
There's a lot of research on this.
A veteran of the TED scene is my friend Jonathan Haidt.
He is a professor of psychology at New York University.
It works on the ideology, values and morals of different people to see their differences.
He has shown us, for example, that conservatives and liberals have a different emphasis on what they think is important.
For example, Jon Haidt showed that liberals care about 59% more about poverty than about economic freedom.
And conservatives care about 28% more about economic freedom than poverty.
Irreconcilable differences?
We'll never come together. False.
It is in diversity that our strength lies.
Remember what brought us out of poverty.
It was an obsession with poverty accompanied by the method of economic freedom spreading around the world.
We need others, in other words, if we want to help people and get out of poverty the next two billion.
There is no alternative.
How are we going to do it?
It's tricky.
We need to innovate in the way we think.
Many points are on stage.
Social entrepreneurship. Yeah. Absolutely. Phenomenal.
We need to invest abroad in a sustainable, responsible, ethical and moral manner. Yes. Yes.
But what do we really need?
Flexible ideology,
less predictable.
No?
Do you ever feel that your ideology is becoming predictable?
Almost conventional?
Don't you feel like you're always listening to people who agree with you?
Why is it dangerous?
Because when we talk about the economy in this country, on the right, the Conservatives, you always talk about taxes, regulations, a big government.
And on the left, liberals, you always talk about income inequality.
These are important things, very important to me and to you.
But when it comes to helping people who starve and need us, it's distractions.
We need to rally around the best ways to alleviate poverty using the best tools at our disposal, and that only comes when the Conservatives admit that they need the Liberals and their obsession with poverty, and the Conservatives' liberals and their obsession with the free market.
It is in this diversity that the future strength of this country lies, if we choose it.
How are we going to do it? How are we going to do it together?
I need an action plan, not just for you but for me.
Number one. The first point is that it is not enough to tolerate people who disagree.
It's not enough.
Let us remember that we need people who disagree, because there are people who need all of us, who are still waiting for these tools.
What are you going to do? How are you going to express it?
Where does it start? It starts here.
In this room, we're all lucky.
Lucky to have people listening to us.
Lucky to prosper. Lucky to lead.
When people hear us, with unpredictable ideology, they may listen to us.
Progress may begin there.
That is the first point. The second one.
Deuzio: I ask you and I wonder specifically who is blurring the border, who is ambiguous, difficult to classify.
If you're a conservative, be a conservative who always talks about poverty and the moral obligation to be a warrior to the poor.
If you are a liberal, be a liberal who always talks about the beauty of free markets, used responsibly, to solve our problems.
If we do that, we get two things.
One: we're starting to work for the next billion and be the solution that we've seen in the past and we need in the future. We get that.
And the second thing is that we could be able to take the dreadful and holy ideological war that we are suffering in this country and turn it into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
And then maybe, maybe, we'll realize that our big differences aren't that big in the end.
Thank you.
At university, I specialized in Political Science, so I had to write a lot of essays.
When a normal student writes an essay, he spreads the work a little bit like that.
You know... You may start slowly, but you write a little during the first week and associated with more productive days, in the end, everything is done and everyone keeps calm.
And I'd like to do that.
That would be the goal. Everything would be prepared. But the dissertation comes and then I do that.
And that's how it is for every essay.
So came my 90-page last-year thesis, a document that you're supposed to work on for a year.
I knew that for such an essay, my usual rhythm was not viable.
So I planned everything, and I decided I had to get to something like that.
The year was going to run like this.
So I was going to start light, and I was going to go up in the middle months, and at the end, I was going to set the gear, like a little staircase.
Climbing stairs, where is the difficulty?
It's not much, is it?
But then something funny happened.
These first few months?
They came and passed and I couldn't really work.
So we have a great revised plan.
And so... But then, those middle months came and I didn't really write a word, so we were here.
Then two months turn into a month, which turns into two weeks.
And one day, I wake up three days before the deadline, having still not written a word. So I did the only thing I could: I wrote 90 pages in 72 hours, with not one, but two sleepless nights. Humans are not meant to spend two sleepless nights. I ran through the campus, idle, and gave the essay just before the deadline.
I thought it was the end of all this.
But a week later, I got a phone call from the university.
And they say, "Tim Urban?" ”
And I said, "Yes. ”
"We need to talk about your thesis. ”
"OK. ”
And they say, "That's the best we've ever seen." ”
That's not true.
It was a very, very bad thesis.
I just wanted to enjoy this unique moment when you all thought, "This guy is fantastic." ”
No, she was very, very bad.
Today, I'm writing a blog.
I'm writing the blog Wait But Why.
A few years ago, I decided to write about procrastination.
My behavior has always baffled the non-procrastinators around me. I wanted to explain to the non-prosertors of the world what is happening in our head, why we are like this.
I had a hypothesis that the procrastinator brain is actually different from other people's brains.
To test this, I found a laboratory with MRI that my brain and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator was able to do it, so I could compare them.
I brought them here to show them to you today.
I want you to look carefully to identify a difference.
I know that if you're not brain experts, it's not that obvious, but try.
So this is the brain of a non-procrastinator.
Now...
This is my brain.
There's a difference.
Both brains have a Rational Decision Maker in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.
What does this mean for the procrastinator?
This means that everything is fine until this happens.
So the Rational Decision Maker is going to make the rational decision to do something productive. But the Monkey doesn't like this plan, so it drives and it says, "Actually, let's go read Wikipedia's entire page about the Nancy Kerrigan/Tonya Harding scandal, because I just reminded myself of that. ”
So... So we go all the way to the fridge to see if there's anything new in the last 10 minutes.
After that, we get into a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman about magnets and ends much later with interviews with Justin Bieber's mother.
"It's all going to take time so we're not going to have time to work today. Sorry. ”
What's going on here?
The Monkey doesn't seem to be someone you want when driving.
He lives entirely in the present moment.
He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he is only interested in two things: ease and amusement.
In the animal world, it works well.
If you're a dog and you spend your life doing just easy and fun things, you're fantastic.
For the Monkey, humans are just another animal species.
You have to sleep, eat and create a new generation. This could work in prehistory.
But if you haven't noticed, we don't live on prehistory.
We live in an advanced civilization and the Monkey doesn't know what it is.
That's why we have another person in our brain, the Ratioal decision-maker that gives us the ability to do things that no other animal can do.
We can project ourselves into the future.
We can get an overview of the situation.
Long-term projects can be made.
And he wants to take all this into account.
And he wants us to just do what makes sense, here and now.
Sometimes it makes sense to do easy and fun things, like when you go to bed or you're going to bed or enjoy well-deserved free time.
There is an overlap. Sometimes they agree.
But on other occasions, it makes much more sense to do more difficult and less pleasant things, in the interest of the situation as a whole.
A conflict is then created.
For the procrastinator, this conflict tends to end in the same way each time, allowing it to spend a lot of time in this orange zone, an easy and fun place, totally outside the Circle of Logic.
I call it the Dark Game Field.
The Dark Game Field is a place that all of you procrastinators are very familiar with.
It's the place where we have free time activities at times when they should not take place.
The amusement you have on the Dark Game Field is actually not fun, because it's not-merity and the air is filled with guilt, fear, anxiety, self-remembering, all these feelings of good procrastinator.
In this situation, with the Monkey driving, the question is: How can the procrastinator get here in the blue zone, a less pleasant place, but where are really important things?
It turns out that the procrastinator has a guardian angel. Someone who always watches over him in his worst moments. Someone called the Panic Monster.
The Panic Monster sleeps most of the time, but it suddenly wakes up every time a deadline comes too close or there is a danger of public embarrassment, a career disaster or any other terrible consequence.
And the most important thing is the only thing that the Monkey is afraid of.
It became very relevant in my life very recently, when the people at TED contacted me six months ago and invited me to make a presentation.
Of course, I said yes.
It's always been my dream of having made a TED presentation.
Phrase to the past: But in the midst of this excitement, the Rational Decision Maker seemed to have something else in mind.
He said, "Do you understand what you accepted?"
Do you understand what's going to happen now?
We need to sit back and work on that now. ”
And the Monkey said, "Okay, but let's open Google Earth and look at southern India, like 50 meters above the ground, and scroll the map for two and a half hours, until we reach the north of the country, in order to better understand India. ”
That's what we did that day.
As six months turn into four, then in two and a month the TED people decided to publish the speakers' names.
I opened the website and I saw my face looking at me.
And guess who woke up?
The Panic Monster begins to lose its sense, and a few seconds later, it's anarchy throughout the system.
And the Monkey, remember, it's terrified by the Panic Boom Monster, here it is at the top of the tree.
And finally, the Rational Decision Maker can drive and I can start working on the presentation.
The Panic Monster explains a lot of the procrastinator's rather senseless behavior, like how someone like me can spend two weeks unable to start a sentence of an essay and miraculously find the incredible work ethic to stay awaken all night to write 8 pages.
All this situation, with these three characters, is the procrastinator system.
It's not pretty, but in the end, it works.
That's what I decided to write about on the blog a few years ago.
When I did, I was astonished at the answers.
Thousands of emails have arrived from all over the world, from all sorts of people, doing all sorts of things.
There were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and many, a lot of thessen.
They were all writing to say the same thing: "I also have this problem. ”
But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the article and the heavy tone of those emails.
These people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done with their lives, about what the Monkey had done to them.
I thought about that and I said, if the procrastinator system works, where's the problem?
Why do these people feel so bad?
Apparently, there are two types of procrastinations.
The examples I have given today all have a deadline.
If there is a deadline, the effects of procrastination are contained in the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved.
But there is a second type that arrives in situations with no deadline.
If you want a career as a self-employed person, something in the arts or entrepreneurship, at first, there's no deadline to these things because nothing happens, before you start the hard work to gain momentum for things to move forward. Full of important things
Outside your career doesn't have a maturity, like your family, your health, exercise, work on your romantic relationship or get out when it doesn't work.
If the only procrastinator mechanism to do difficult things is the Panic Monster, it's a problem because in all these situations without deadlines, it's not there, it has no reason to wake up. The effects of procrastination are not contained and propagate to infinity.
It is this type of long-term procrastination that is much less visible and of which we talk much less than the more fun, short-term period based on deadlines.
It is often suffered in silence and in private.
It can be a source of enormous pain and regret.
That's why these people were sending me these emails and why they felt so bad.
It's not that they were baching on some projects.
Long-term procrastination has sometimes made them spectators of their own lives.
Frustration is not that they cannot realize their dreams, it is that they cannot even take the first step.
So I read these emails and I had a kind of enlightenment: I don't think non-procrastinators exist.
That's true. I think you're all procrastinators.
You may not all be in a dirty state like some of us... ...and some here may have a healthy relationship with deadlines. But remember: the greatest trap of the Monkey comes when deadlines don't exist.
I want to show you one last thing.
I call it the Calendar of Life.
One box for every week for a life of 90 years.
It's not so many boxes, especially when you've already used them quite a bit.
I think we should all look closely at this timetable.
We need to think about the issues on which we procrastinate because everyone procrastinates about something in their life.
We must remain aware of the Instantanic Gratification Monkey.
It's a job for all of us.
There aren't so many boxes as that, so it's a job that should probably start today.
Actually, maybe not today...
You know...
Soon.
Thank you.
We were there, souls and bodies crammed into a church in Texas, on the last night of our lives.
Crammed into a room just like this, but with old wooden benches draped with worn red cloth, an organ on my left and a choir behind me, baptismal font embedded in the wall behind it.
A piece like this, however.
With this same tremendous feeling of suspense, the same deep hopes for salvation, the same sweat in the palms, and the same people at the bottom who do not listen.
It was 31 December 1999, the night of Christ's second coming, and the end of the world as I knew him.
I turned 12 that year, and I had reached the age of responsibility.
After I had stopped complaining about the injustice of Jesus' return at the time I had to be held responsible for my actions, I realized that it was better for me to clean up quickly.
I went to church as often as I could.
I was watching silence with the anxiety of someone who was watching the noise, trying to make sure that the Lord had not played me a trick and decided to come back earlier.
And in case He comes back earlier, I had anticipated a contingency plan, reading the series of "Left Behind" that were a hit at the time.
I found in their pages that if I wasn't taken to midnight, I had another chance.
It was enough for me to avoid taking the mark of the beast, of fighting the demons, the scourges and the Antichrist himself.
It would be difficult -- but I knew I was able to do it.
But that was no longer the time to organize.
It was 11:50 p.m.
We had 10 minutes left, and my pastor called us to the altar, for he wanted to pray when midnight would ring.
Each faction of the congregation took its place.
The choir remained in the choir, the deacons and their wives - or the Baptist Bourgeoisie, as I like to call them - placed first in front of the altar.
You see, in the United States, even the second coming of Christ has a VIP section.
And just behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie were the elderly -- those men and women whose backs had once bent under the warm sun of the cotton fields of eastern Texas, whose skins seemed to be marked with a smooth and noble brown, just like the clay of East Texas, whose hopes and dreams of the future of their lives outside of Texas had sometimes been broken.
more profound than their backs.
Yes, these men and women were for me the stars of the show.
They had waited that moment for all their lives, as their Middle Ages predecessors had eagerly awaited the end of the world, and as my grandmother waited for the Oprah Winfrey Show on Channel 8, every day, at 4pm.
And as she walked to the altar, I hid behind her, because I was absolutely certain that my grandmother would go to heaven.
And I thought if I clung her hand hard during prayer, I might go with her.
So I held his hand, and I closed my eyes, to listen, to wait.
The prayers became stronger.
And the cries in response to the call of prayer rose even higher.
The organ joined the funeral atmosphere.
And the nascent heat joined the sweat.
My hand tightens its embrace, so as not to be the one abandoned.
I closed my eyes louder, so as not to see the separation of the good grain from the chaff.
Then a voice rose above us: "Amen. ”
It was over.
I looked at the clock.
It was past midnight.
I looked at the older believers, whose Savior had not come, who were too proud to show their disappointment, who had believed too much and for too long to begin to doubt now.
But I was upset for them.
They had been deceived, deceived, cobbled, and I had allowed myself to be embarked with them.
I had said their prayers, I had not given in to the temptation as best I could.
I hadn't dipped my head once, but twice, in those baptismal fonts that gave the dirt.
I thought.
And now what?
I came home in time to turn on the television and watch Peter Jennings announce the new millennium as he was advancing around the world.
I was struck by the oddity of the many returns of Jesus, based on the different time zones.
And I felt even more ridiculous -- hurt, really.
But that night, I kept believing.
I just started to believe something new: that it was possible not to believe.
It was possible that the answers were false, that the questions themselves were wrong.
Now, where a mountain of certainty had been found, there was, rushing towards its base, a source of doubt, a spring that promised rivers.
I can find the origin of the whole drama of my life, that night, in this church, when my Savior did not come for me; when what I really believed was turned out, if not a lie, at least not the truth.
Although some have prepared themselves in the year 2000 in a very different way, I am convinced that you are here because part of you has done the same thing as me since the beginning of this new century, since my mother left, my father has not returned and my Lord refused to come.
And I stretched out my hand, in order to reach something to believe in.
I stood firm, when I arrived in Yale at the age of 18, confident that my trip from Oak Cliff, Texas, was a chance to leave behind all the hardships I had experienced, the broken dreams and bodies that I had seen.
But when I found myself at home during a winter vacation, my face on the ground, with my hands tied behind my back, and the gun of a burglar on my head, I knew that even the best education couldn't save me.
I held the geese when I arrived at Lehman Brothers as an intern in 2008.
So hopeful - that I called my family to inform them that we would never be poor again.
But when I saw this temple of finance collapse before my very eyes, I knew that even the best job could not save me.
I stood by when I arrived in Washington, D.C., as a young employee, who had heard a voice from Illinois, saying, "We've been waiting a long time, but with this election, change has come to the United States. ”
But when Congress came to the fore, the country torn apart, and hope and change sounded like a joke, I knew that even the second political coming could not save me.
I had faithfully knelt at the altar of the American Dream, praying to the gods of my time, gods of success, money, and power.
But again and again, midnight was ringing, and I opened my eyes to see the death of all these gods.
From this cemetery, I began to seek once again, not out of courage, but because I knew that I either believed or I was dying.
So I did a pilgrimage, again to another Mecca, Harvard Business School, knowing this time that I couldn't just accept the salvation it claimed to offer.
No, I knew there would be more work to be done.
Work started late, in a dark corner of a crowded party, the night of an early and miserable winter in Cambridge, when three friends and I wondered what young people in search of authenticity have been wondering for a very long time, "What if we were to go down the road? ”
We didn't know where to go or how to go, but we knew we had to do it.
All our lives, we were languishing, as Jack Kerouac wrote, of "sneaking into the night and disappear somewhere," and go and see what everybody was doing all over the country.
Although there were other voices that the risk was too great and the evidence too meagre, we were still parties.
We traveled nearly 13,000 kilometers across America in the summer of 2013, through the pastures of Montana, through the desolation of Detroit, the marshes of New Orleans, where we found and worked with men and women who created small businesses whose intent set goals.
Having been trained at the western end of capitalism, this has appeared to us as a revolutionary idea.
And this idea spread, developing into a nonprofit organization, MBAs Across America a movement that made me land here, on this stage, today.
This idea developed because we found that our generation is hungry for purpose, for meaning, for a little bit of purpose, of purpose.
because we found countless entrepreneurs in every corner of America, who created jobs, changed lives and needed a little help.
But if I'm honest, it also developed because I fought for it.
I spared no effort to preach this gospel, to make more people believe that we could close the wounds of a broken country, one social enterprise at a time.
But it was this gospel journey that led me to this rather different gospel that I have come to share with you today.
This trip began one evening, almost a year ago, at the Natural History Museum in New York City, at a gala for alumni of Harvard Business School.
Under a replica of a life-size whale, I sat down with the titans of our time, as they celebrated their peers and good deeds.
There was pride in a room where the value and net assets under management exceeded 500 billion dollars.
We looked at everything we had done, and that was good.
But chance meant that, two days later, I had to go not very far away in Harlem. I found myself sitting in an urban farm that had once been a wasteland, listening to a man named Tony told me about the children who came here every day.
They all lived below the poverty line.
Many of them carried their possessions in a backpack to avoid losing them in a homeless shelter.
Some of them were participating in Tony's program, called Harlem Grown, to receive their only meal of the day.
Tony told me that he had launched Harlem Grown with his retirement money, after 20 years as a taxi driver.
He told me that he was not paying for himself, because, despite his success, the programme was struggling to obtain resources.
He told me that he would accept all the help he could receive.
And I was there to help.
When I left Tony, I felt the burning and salt of tears that were coming to my eye.
I felt the weight of the revelation that I could sit in a room one night, where a few hundred people had 500 billion dollars and in another room, two days later, just five kilometers away, where a man lived without pay for a child to have his only meal of the day.
It wasn't the glaring inequality that made me want to cry. It wasn't the thought of these hungry kids, homeless, it wasn't rage for the 1% or pity for the 99%.
No, I was disturbed because I had finally realized that I was dialysis from a country that needed a kidney transplant.
I realized that my story replaced all of those who were expected to take charge of, even if they had nothing to grab their own hands; that my body was replacing all the structural, systemic aid that never went to Harlem, or the Appalachians or the floor --9, that my voice replaced all those voices that seemed too ignorant, too proletarian.
And this shame, this shame has overwhelmed me, like the shame of sitting in front of the television watching Peter Jennings herald the new millennium, again and again, and again.
I had been deceived, deceived, bowed.
But this time, the false Savior was me.
You see, I've come a long way from the altar, the night I thought the world was going to end, from a world where people spoke in tongues, viewed suffering as a necessary act of God, and took a text as an infallible truth.
Yes, I've come so far that I find myself exactly where I started.
Because it's just wrong to say that we live in an era of disbelief -- no, we believe today as much as before.
Some of us may believe in the prophecy of Brené Brown or Tony Robbins.
We can believe in the New Yorker or Harvard Business Review Bible.
We can believe deeply when we worship here, at TED church, but we desperately want to believe, we need to believe.
We speak the language of charismatic leaders who promise to solve all our problems.
We see suffering as a necessary act of capitalism, our god. We take the text of technological progress as the infallible truth.
And we barely realize the human price that we pay, when we fail to question a brick, lest it destroys all our foundations.
But if you are disturbed by the unacceptable things that we have come to accept, then it must be time for a questioning.
I have no gospel of disruption or innovation, or a triple line of results.
In fact, I don't have a gospel of faith to share with you today.
I have, and offer, a gospel of doubt.
The gospel of doubt does not ask that you cease to believe, but that you believe in something new: that it is possible not to believe.
It is possible that the answers are false, that the questions themselves are false.
Yes, the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that we, on this stage, in this room, are wrong.
Because she raises the question, "Why? ”
With all the power we have in our hands, why do people still suffer so much?
This doubt leads me to share that we are placing my organization, MBAs Across America, in an end to its activity.
We have fired our team and closed our doors, and we will share our model freely with anyone who grasps the power to do this work without waiting for our permission.
This doubt forces me to give up the role of savior that some expect of me, because there is not enough time and our chances are too slim to wait for seconds, when the truth is that there will be no miracles here.
And this doubt, it regenerates me, it gives me hope, that when our problems overwhelm us, when the paths designed to lead us to our loss, when our healers do not help our wounds, it will not be our blind faith - no, it will be our humble doubt that will illuminate a little the darkness of our lives and our world, and will allow us to make our voices heard,
or to shout, or just to say, very simply, "There must be another way. ”
Thank you.
The food crisis
is in the act every day.
But what is it?
In some parts of the world, there is too little food, or perhaps too much food.
Elsewhere, GMOs save the world.
Maybe GMOs are the problem?
Too much agricultural run-off creates toxic oceans, declining food.
And so on.
I find the current climate of this discussion incredibly discouraging.
How can we bring this topic back to something we understand?
What does this apple of the food crisis tell us?
You all ate an apple last week, I'm sure.
How old do you think she was when she was picked?
Two weeks?
Two months?
Eleven months. This is the average age of an apple in a grocery store in the United States.
And I do not think it is very different in Europe or anywhere else in the world.
We pick them, we put them in cold stores, we're gassing the warehouses. There's actually documented evidence from workers trying to go into these environments to get an apple back, and who die because the atmosphere to slow the apple's maturation is toxic to humans.
How is it that none of you knew?
Why didn't I know?
Ninety percent of the quality of this apple, all the antioxidants, went away when she got to our house.
In fact, it's just a little sugar ball.
How do we have so little information and how can we do better?
I think what's missing is a platform.
I know the platforms. I know computers. I was stuck to the Internet when I was young.
I did some very strange things... ... on this platform.
But I met people, and I could speak.
How can we express ourselves in food?
If we had a platform, we might feel able to ask, if only?
I asked myself, what if... the climate was democratic?
So here's a map of the climate in the world.
The most productive areas in green, the least productive in red.
They change, they replace, and Californian farmers are now Mexican.
China takes land in Brazil to cultivate better food, and we are the slaves of the climate.
What if each country had its own productive climate?
What would that change to the way we live?
What would that change for the quality of life and food?
The problem of the previous generation was to have more food and to have it cheaper.
Welcome to your global farm.
We built a huge analog farm.
All these lines are cars, planes, trains and transport.
It's a miracle that we feed seven billion people with only a few of us involved in food production.
And what would happen if...
We were building a digital farm?
A global digital farm.
What if you could take this apple, kind of scan it, send it into the air, and make it up on the other side?
What would happen?
Let's take a few quotes. It inspires me in what I do.
The first is, “Nippon agriculture has no childhood, no water, no land and no future. That's what I found out when I went to Minamisanriku, south of Fukushima, after the disaster.
The children went to Sendai and Tokyo, the land is contaminated, they already import 70% of their own food.
But this is not just about Japan.
2% of the American population is involved in agriculture.
What is the right answer of only 2% of the population?
Looking around the world, 50% of the African population is under the age of 18.
80% of them do not want to become a farmer.
Agriculture is difficult.
The life of a small agricultural entrepreneur is miserable.
They're going to the city.
In India, farmers do not have access to basic services. There are more suicides from farmers this year than the previous 10.
It makes you uncomfortable talking about it.
Where are they leaving?
To the city.
There are no more young people, and everyone is leaving.
So how can we build a platform that inspires young people?
Welcome to the new tractor.
This is my combine harvester.
A few years ago now, I went to Bed Bath's house, Beyond, and Home Depot and I started hackering.
I built stupid things, I made the plants dance, I connected them to my computer, and I killed them all; I killed a lot of them.
I finally managed to make them live.
And I created one of the most intimate relationships in my whole life, because I learned the language of plants.
I wanted to make it bigger.
I was told, "Learn yourselves, young man."
This is an old electronics lab that nobody wants.
What can you do? ”
With my team, we built a farm inside the Media Lab, a reputable place, not for biology, but rather for computer science.
Inside these 6 square meters, we produced enough food to feed about 300 people once a month. It's little food.
There's a lot of interesting technology in this.
But the most interesting thing?
Beautiful roots, white, green, deep colors and a monthly harvest.
Is this a new cafeteria?
Is this a new retail experience?
Is this a new grocery store?
I can assure you something: this is the first time that someone in the Media Lab has pulled the roots of anything.
We have salads in sachets, there's nothing wrong with that.
But what happens when you have an image processing expert, a data specialist, a roboticist, who pulls roots and think, "I know a little bit about it." I can do it, I want to try. ”
In this context, we would push the plants and bring some of them back to the lab, because if you grow them, you don't throw away, you get attached to them.
I have funny taste buds now; I'm afraid to let anyone eat something without having tasted it, because I want it to be good.
I eat lettuce every day and I can give its pH to the nearest 0.1.
And I say, "No, its pH is 6.1, you can't eat it today." ”
That lettuce that day was very sweet.
She was very gentle because the plant was stressed and she had caused a chemical reaction in her to protect herself: "I'm not going to die. ”
And plants that don't want to die seem sweet to me.
Technologists fall inverting to plant physiology.
We thought other people should be able to try.
We wanted to see what people can create, we designed a lab that we can ship anywhere.
Then we built it.
On the facade of the Media Lab, there's my lab, which has about 30 detection points per plant.
If you know the genome or the genetics, that's the phenome, right?
Phenomena.
When you say, "I like Mexican strawberries," you really like the strawberries of the climate that produced the phrase that you like.
So if you code the climate -- that amount of CO2 and that amount of oxygen creates a recipe -- you code the expression of that plant, the nutrition of that plant, the size of this plant, the shape, the color, the texture.
We need data, so we put a bunch of sensors to tell us what's going on.
Think about your indoor plants. You're super sad because you're wondering, "Why are you dying?" Why don't you talk to me? ”
Farmers acquire a unique capacity when they pass the 60- or 70-year mark.
They can tell when a plant dies that it's nitrogen deficiency, calcium deficiency, or that it needs more water.
This unique capacity is not transmitted.
These are the omen of the "cloud farmer."
We track this data over time.
We correlate them with particular plants.
These are all the broccoli in my lab, by IP address.
Our broccoli can be reached by IP address.
And if that's not weird enough, you click once and get the profile of a plant.
And that gives you the downloadable evolution of this plant, but not as you think, not just when it's ready.
When does it reach the nutrition I need?
When does it reach the desired taste?
Does she get too much water?
Does she get too much sunshine?
Alerts.
She can talk to me, she dialogue, we have a language.
I think she's the first user of Facebook plants.
It's her plant profile and this plant is going to start making friends.
I think she'll make friends with other plants that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, less potassium.
We will learn more about complexity than we could only assume.
Maybe they won't become our friends, maybe they'll do it, it'll be up to us.
This is my lab.
It's a little more organized, my job is to design data centers for hospitals, so I'm well aware of the creation of controlled environments.
And so, within this environment, we experience all sorts of things.
This process, aeroponic, was developed by NASA for the Mir space station to reduce the amount of water sent to space.
This process gives the plant exactly what it wants: water, minerals and oxygen.
The roots are not so complicated. When you give them that, you get an amazing result.
It's like the plant has two hearts.
And because it has two hearts, it grows four or five times faster.
It's a perfect world.
We've moved forward in techno and seeds for an unfavorable world, and we're going to continue to do that, but we also have a new tool, which is a perfect world.
We've grown all sorts of things.
These tomatoes had not been produced and sold for 150 years.
Do you know that we have rare and old seed banks?
Seed banks.
It's amazing.
They have genetic material, things you've never eaten.
I'm the only person in this room who ate this kind of tomato.
It's a sauce tomato that we can't cook. We ate this tomato. And it wasn't top.
We did things with proteins, all sorts of things.
We grew humans. Maybe you would, but we didn't do it.
What we realized was... that the tool was too big, and too expensive.
I was starting to distribute it around the world, and it cost about 100,000 dollars.
Finding someone with 100,000 in their pocket isn't easy, so we've been trying to get smaller.
It was the project of one of my undergraduate students of mechanical engineering, Camille.
Camille and I and the whole team, we've been trying all summer, how to make it cheaper, that it works better, than others can do.
We dropped them off in schools, from sixth grade to senior.
And if you want to stay humble, try to teach children.
I went to school and I said, "Register the humidity to 65 percent." ”
A middle schoolman said to me, "What's humidity?" ”
I said, "Water in the air." ”
He said, "There's no water in the air, you're an idiot." ”
And I said, "Very well...
Don't trust me.
Rule it to 100. ”
He puts it to 100 and what's going on?
It's starting to condense, it's getting a mess and, finally, it's going to fall out of a digging way, it's starting to condense, it's getting a mess
And he says, "Oh. Humidity is rain.
Why didn't you tell me? ”
We've created an interface like a game.
They have a 3D environment, they can connect anywhere in the world from their smartphones or tablets.
They have the different parts of the bots, the sensors.
They choose recipes created by other children all over the world.
They select and activate this recipe, they plant a sowing.
While it grows, they make changes.
"Why does a plant need CO2?
Is CO2 bad? He kills people. ”
Intensify the CO2, the plant is dying.
Reduce CO2, the plant is fine.
Harvest the plant, you just created a new digital recipe.
It's a design, iterative development, and an exploration process.
They can download all the data on this new plant that they've developed or the new digital recipe and what it did -- was it better or worse?
Imagine this as the little hearts of the process.
We'll learn so much.
This is one of the food industry, as we call them, in a school after three weeks.
It's three weeks of growth.
But more importantly, it was the first time that this kid thought he could be a farmer - or that he might want to be a farmer.
We've put everything in open source.
Everything is online; try to build your first food industry.
It's going to be hard - I'm telling you.
We are at the beginning, but it is all there.
It's very important for me that it's easily accessible.
We will continue to move in that direction.
They are farmers, electrical engineers, mechanics, environmental engineers, computer scientists, plant scientists, economists, urban planners, etc.
on a single platform, doing what they're good at.
But we've seen a little too big.
This is my new installation that we've just started.
This warehouse could be everywhere.
That's why I chose it.
And inside this warehouse we're going to build something a little bit like that.
These already exist.
Look.
These also exist.
One makes it possible to grow green, the other makes it possible to produce the Ebola vaccine.
It's cool that this factory, the big winner of the DARPA challenge, is one of the reasons for progress on Ebola.
Factories produce the protein that resists the Ebola virus.
Pharmaceutical products, from nutraceuticals to simple lettuce.
But these two things are not the same, and that's where I'm in my field.
Everything is different.
We're at this weird point of, "We're almost there." It's a little bit, "Here's my black box." "No, buy mine."
"No, no--I have intellectual property, quite valid."
Don't buy his own, buy mine. ”
In fact, we're just at the beginning, at a time when society is also changing.
As we demand more but less expensive food, we are asking for better food that respects the environment.
When you have a McDonald's ad that explains what's in the McNuggets, -- the most mysterious food product of all time -- on which their marketing campaign is based, everything is changing.
From now on,
personal food computers, food servers, and food data centres, work on the open phenomenon.
Think open genome, but we're going to add small climate recipes, like Wikipedia, which you can recover, update and grow.
What does this look like in reality?
Do you remember the planet connected by lines?
We're starting to have the beacons.
We're starting to send info about food, rather than sending the food.
This is not only my dream, it's the places where we're already deploying.
Food computers, food servers, soon food data centers, connecting people to share information.
The future of food is not to fight against what is wrong.
We know what's wrong.
The future of food is on networking the next billion farmers and giving them power through a platform to ask and answer the question, "What would happen if? ”
Thank you.
Sometimes I feel ashamed of being a European.
Last year, more than a million people in need of our help arrived in Europe and our response was frankly pathetic.
There are so many contradictions.
We mourn the tragic death of Alan Kurdi, a two-year-old child, and yet, since then, more than 200 children have drowned in the Mediterranean.
International treaties recognise that refugees are a collective responsibility, and yet we accept that little Lebanon should welcome more Syrians than the whole of the united Europe.
We are lamenting the existence of smugglers, yet we are making the only viable path to seek asylum in Europe.
We lack the workforce, yet we are preventing people who meet our economic and demographic needs from coming to Europe.
We proclaim our liberal values in opposition to fundamentalist Islam, yet -- we have repressive policies that arrest minor asylum seekers, that separate children from their families and that seize the property of refugees.
What are we doing?
How did we get there, so we adopted such an inhumane response to a humanitarian crisis?
I do not believe that this is due to a lack of interest, at least I do not want to believe it.
I believe that it is because our politicians have no vision, that they do not know how to adapt the international asylum rules, created more than 50 years ago, to globalisation.
I want to take a step back and ask two fundamental questions, the two questions that we all have to ask.
Firstly, why does the current system not work?
Secondly, how can we remedy it?
The current regime for refugees was created following the consequences of World War II by these people.
Its primary purpose is to ensure that when a State fails, or worse, turns against its people, people have a place to go, where to live in safety and dignity until they can return.
It was created precisely for situations such as the current situation in Syria.
Through an international convention signed by 147 Governments, the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and an international organization, UNHCR, States have undertaken to admit reciprocally persons fleeing conflict and persecution to their territory.
But today, this system is failing.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In practice, our immigration policies are blocking the path to security.
In theory, refugees have the right to integration or return to their countries of origin.
But in practice, they get stuck in eternal limbo.
In theory, refugees are a common global responsibility.
In practice, geography means that countries close to the conflict host the overwhelming majority of refugees.
The system is not broken because the rules are bad
But because we are not applying them properly to a changing world, and that is what we need to reconsider.
I'm going to explain to you how the current system works.
How did the current refugee regime work?
But not from an institutional perspective, rather from the point of view of a refugee.
Imagine a Syrian woman. Let's call her Amira.
To me, Amira represents
A lot of people I've met in the area.
Amira, like 25 percent of the world's refugees, is a woman with children, and she can't go home because she comes from this city that you see: Homs. A city that was beautiful and historic and is now in ruins.
Amira can't go back.
But Amira has no hope of settling in a third country, because there is a lottery available to just less than 1% of the refugees.
Amira and her family face an impossible choice.
They have three options.
The first option is that Amira takes her family to a camp.
In the camp, she could be helped, but there is little future for Amira and her family.
The camps are in austere and arid places, often in the desert.
In Jordan's camp, at night, you hear the bombings across the border.
Economic activity is restricted.
Education is often of poor quality.
Worldwide, about 80 per cent of refugees in camps must remain there for at least five years.
It's a miserable life, and that's probably why, in reality, only 9% of Syrians choose this option.
An alternative for Amira is to head to the urban area of a neighbouring country, such as Amman or Beirut.
It is an option chosen by about 75% of Syrian refugees.
But it also involves difficulties.
Refugees in such urban areas often do not have the right to work.
They often do not have access to help.
And so when Amira and his family have spent all their savings, they will have nothing left and will be in urban poverty.
There is a third possibility that an increasing number of Syrians will choose.
Amira can seek hope for her family by risking their lives on a dangerous and perilous journey to another country, and that is what we see today in Europe.
We therefore offer refugees an almost impossible choice between three options: encampment, urban poverty or a dangerous journey.
For refugees, this choice is the refugee regime of today.
But I think it's a false choice.
We can reconsider that choice.
The reason we are limiting these options is because we believe that these are the only options available to refugees, but that is not the case.
Politicians see this as a zero-sum problem, if we benefit refugees, citizens pay the price.
We tend to think that refugees are an inevitable cost or a burden on society.
But they don't have to be. They can contribute.
What I want to say is that there are ways to increase opportunities and that everyone benefits: host countries and communities, our societies and refugees.
And I want to suggest four ways to transform our view of refugees.
These four points of view have one thing in common: they include the opportunities of globalization, mobility and markets, and modernize our way of thinking about the refugee problem.
The first idea is that of favourable environments. It begins with the fundamental recognition that refugees are human beings like everyone else, but with extraordinary circumstances.
Together with my colleagues in Oxford, we embarked on a research project in Uganda, observing the economic life of the refugees.
We have chosen Uganda, not because it is representative of all host countries.
It is exceptional.
Unlike the majority of host countries, Uganda had given refugees an economic opportunity.
It gives them the right to work, the freedom to move.
And the results are extraordinary for refugees and for the host community.
In the capital, Kampala, we have discovered that 21 per cent of refugees have a business that employs people and 40 per cent of these employees are natives of the host country.
In other words, refugees create work for the citizens of the host country.
Even in the camps, we have discovered extraordinary examples of dynamic and thriving companies.
For example, in a village called Nakivale, we have the example of Congolese refugees running digital music-sharing companies.
We found a Rwandan running a company to enable young people to play video games on recycled consoles and televisions.
Despite the difficulties of extreme constraints, refugees innovate and the man you see is a Congolese named Demoused.
Demou-Kay arrived in the encampment with very few properties, but he wanted to become a director.
So, with friends and colleagues, he started a community radio station, he rented a camera and made movies.
He made two documentaries with and for our team and he's starting a successful business with almost nothing.
It is such examples that should guide our response to refugees.
Rather than seeing refugees as inevitably dependent on humanitarian assistance, we must provide them with the opportunity for human development.
Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food are very important in the emergency phase, but we need to go further.
We must offer the opportunity for connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, access to banks.
Everything we see for granted, that integrates us into the global economy can and should be offered to refugees.
The second idea I want to talk about is the economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all the host countries of the world have the approach of Uganda.
Most host countries do not open their economies to refugees in this way.
But there are always pragmatic options that we can use.
Last April, I went to Jordan with my colleague, the development economist, Paul Collier, and we reflected on an idea that we had there with the international community and the government, an idea to create jobs for Syrians while supporting Jordan's national development strategy.
This is the idea of an economic zone where we could potentially integrate the employment of refugees and the employment of the natives of the host country.
At 15 minutes from the camp, which houses 83,000 refugees, there is the development zone of King Hussein Bin Talal.
The government spent more than 100 million dollars connecting it to the electricity grid and road grid, but there were two things missing: access to labour and foreign investment.
so that refugees can work there rather than being stranded in camps, support their families, develop skills through vocational training before returning to Syria.
We recognized that Jordan would benefit, as its development strategy required a shift from a middle-income country to an industrial country.
Refugees would benefit from it, but it would also contribute to the post-war reconstruction of Syria, recognizing that we must incubate the refugees because they are the best resource for rebuilding Syria.
We published this idea in the journal Foreign Affairs.
King Abdullah took up the idea.
This was announced at the London conference on Syria and a test will begin in the summer.
The third idea I want to submit to you is the notion of preference between states and refugees leading to positive results that you see in this selfie where Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee are.
We rarely ask refugees what they want, where they want to go, but we can do it and it will be better for everyone.
The economist Alvin Roth has developed the idea of market adequacy, where the order of preference of the parties determines their possible correspondence.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teytelboym have looked at ways to apply this idea to refugees, to ask refugees to rank destinations but also to allow States to rank the type of refugees desired on the basis of competence or language, and then match them.
Of course, quotas should be introduced on diversity and vulnerability, but this is one way of increasing the chances of correspondence.
The idea of correspondence is used successfully to, for example, distribute students to university, match kidney donors and patients, and the algorithm exists at dating sites.
Why not apply this to offer choice to refugees?
It could also be used at the national level, where one of the greatest challenges is to persuade local communities to accept refugees.
Currently, in my country, for example, we often send engineers in rural areas and farmers to the city, which makes no sense.
The matching markets make it possible to combine these preferences and to listen to the needs and demands of the host population and the refugees.
The fourth idea I am referring to is the principle of a humanitarian visa.
Tragedies and disorders in Europe could have been avoided.
They come from a fundamental contradiction in European asylum policy: in order to apply for asylum in Europe, you must arrive spontaneously by embarking on a dangerous journey that I have already mentioned.
But why are these journeys necessary in the era of low-cost airlines and modern consular resources?
These journeys are not necessary and, last year, they led to the deaths of more than 3 000 people on the borders of Europe and on European territory.
If refugees had the right to travel directly and to apply for asylum in Europe, we would avoid that. And we can do that with humanitarian visas that allow people to obtain a visa from an embassy or consulate in a neighbouring country and then by paying for their ferry or air to Europe.
It costs around EUR 1 000 to pay a smuggler from Turkey to the Greek islands.
A low-cost flight from Bodrum to Frankfurt costs 200 euros.
If we allowed the refugees, that would have major benefits.
This would save lives, it would weaken the market for smugglers and mark the end of the disorder observed in the first European line in areas such as the Greek islands.
It is the laws that prevent us from doing so, not a rational solution.
This is an idea that has been applied.
Brazil had taken a forward-looking approach and more than 2,000 Syrians had obtained humanitarian visas, had gone to Brazil and, on arrival, applied for refugee status.
In this configuration, every Syrian who did this was granted refugee status and was recognized as a refugee.
There is a historic precedent.
Between 1922 and 1942, these Nansen passports were used as travel documents authorizing 450,000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens to travel to Europe and apply for refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
And the Nansen International Refugee Bureau was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this viable strategy.
Each of these four ideas that I've presented to you are ways to extend Admira's choices.
These are ways we can increase the choice of refugees beyond these options, these three impossible options that I have detailed to you, while benefiting others.
In conclusion, we need a new perspective that extends the choice of refugees but recognizes that they do not have to be a burden.
There is nothing inevitable about the fact that refugees are a cost.
Yes, they are a humanitarian responsibility, but they are human beings with skills, talents, aspirations and the ability to contribute, if we allow them to do so.
In the new world, migration will not stop.
What we have seen in Europe will continue for years.
People will still travel, people will be displaced and we need to find rational and realistic ways to manage it, not based on the old logic of humanitarian aid, charity, but built on the opportunities offered by globalisation, markets and mobility.
I urge you to wake you up and I urge our politicians to wake up to this challenge.
Thank you very much.
When I was a kid, I dreamed of the ocean.
A wild, very colorful and vibrant place, home to weird and fantastic creatures.
I imagined big masterly sharks and graceful sea tirts vibrating through the corals.
First a marine biologist, then a photographer, I spent most of my career looking for places as magical as the ones I dreamed of as little.
As you can see, I started exploring water very early on.
But the first time I really went underwater, I was about 10 years old.
I remember perfectly giving the blows of palms determined to reach this old cannon inlaid in a shallow coral reef.
When I was finally able to catch it, I looked up and found myself encircled with fish of all the colors of the rainbow.
That day, I fell in love with the ocean.
Thomas Peschak Marine Conservation Photographer In 40 years on Earth, I had the immense privilege of exploring some of the wildest marine landscapes for National Geographic and Save Our Seas Foundation.
I photographed everything, from huge sharks to tiny ones that fit in the palm of my hand.
I felt the fish in the breath of the humpback whales feeding next to me in the cold waters of Canada, near the Great Bear Rainforest.
I even learned all about green turtle-loving rituals in the Mozambique Canal.
We all leave a footprint on the ocean and vice versa.
And the pristine seas that I dreamed of are always harder to find.
They are always smaller and more threatened.
While we humans maintain our role as the world's largest predator, I witnessed direct repercussions and photographed them.
I thought I long thought I had to shock my audience with disturbing images to get it out of its indifference.
This approach has its merits, but I have come back.
In my opinion, the best way to bring about change is to sell love.
If you want, I'm a couple maker and, as a photographer, I have an exceptional opportunity to reveal entire animals and ecosystems beneath the surface of the ocean.
You can't love and fight for something if you don't know your existence.
Revealing this -- that's the whole power of marine photography.
Of the hundreds of underwater places I've seen, a handful of these landscapes have deeply touched me.
I saw the first of these landscapes, about 10 years ago, off the wild and steep coasts of South Africa.
Every summer, huge sardine banks move north, a mass migration phenomenon called the Sardine Run.
A crazy race of these fish
where hordes of starving and agile predators chase them.
The common dolphins hunt together and manage to isolate sardines from the main bench and create small benches.
They plunge and trap the fish upwards, against the surface and rush to appreciate their strewing feast.
Sharks follow closely.
For many people, sharks and dolphins are sworn enemies, but during Sardine Run they live together.
In fact, dolphins help sharks feed more effectively.
Without the dolphins, the small shoals created are more sparse and sharks often end up with a "sardine doughnut" or a bite of water.
I had some animated moments with sharks on Sardine Run, but I know they don't see me as prey.
I get blows and am jostled like all the other participants in this brawler banquet.
Let us leave the African coasts, to the east, through the immensity of the Indian Ocean to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral islands.
During the monsoon season, manta rays from the entire archipelago travel to a tiny islet of Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.
Armies of crustaceans, most smaller than a marble, are the staple food of manta rays.
When plankton concentrations are low, manta rays feed on their own and they make back-to-loop pirouettes like a puppy chasing its tail.
When the plankton density increases, the lines line up at leu leu leu tail and form these long chains. Each delicious bite that escapes the first is swallowed by the second or the next.
When the plankton concentration reaches its peak, the manta rays swim ever closer in a rotary movement through which they feed.
As they swirl in this narrow formation, the manta ray column creates its own vortex, aspiring and bringing the right plankton into the cavernous mouth of the rays.
The experience of diving among these innumerable rays is absolutely unforgettable.
The first time I photographed Hanifaru, the site was unprotected and threatened by development.
I worked with NGOs like Manta Trust, and my photos helped make Hicornu a marine protected area.
Fishermen from the nearby islands hunted these manta rays, using their skins to make traditional drums.
Today, they are the most fervent conservatives, and manta rays bring more than 8 million dollars to the maldive economy every year.
I always wanted to go back in time and see an era where the cards were incomplete or said, "Here's dragons."
I got the most out of it by visiting these distant atolls in the heart of the Indian Ocean.
Far, far away from the lines of boats and fishing, diving into these waters is a poignant memory of what our oceans have once looked like.
Bassas da India is largely unknown. It's a tiny coral corner in the Mozambique Canal.
Its barrier forms a shield that protects its inner lagoon, a nursery for Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are anything but shy, even during the day.
Something told me they would be even bolder and more numerous at night.
I found myself faced with more sharks than ever before, gathered on a simple outcrop.
Photographing and sharing moments like these reminds me why I chose this path.
Not long ago, I was working on a project in Baja California for National Geographic.
Halfway along the Pacific coast, there is San Ignacio Lagoon, where the gray whale comes to give birth.
For a century, this coast has been the scene of a systematic massacre, with more than 20,000 grey whales being killed, leaving only a few hundred in survival.
Today, the descendants of these same whales are playing on the surface with their offspring and they even interact with us.
This species has done remarkably.
On the other side of the peninsula is Cabo Pulmo, a drowning fishing village.
Decades of overfishing have taken them to the gates of collapse.
In 1995, local fishermen convinced the authorities to make their waters a marine reserve.
But what happened next was a miracle.
In 2005, after only a decade of protection, scientists recorded the largest increase in fish.
But don't take my word for it, come with me.
In a breath, swim in the depths with me in the middle of one of the largest and densest schools of fish I've ever encountered.
We all have the opportunity to create hope.
And through my photos, I'd like to convey the message that it's not too late for our oceans.
And I would particularly like to highlight nature's resistance to 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, I have to search hard to make photos like this, while creating images that show our respectful coexistence with the ocean that,
I hope, will become the daily life for me.
To prosper and survive by doing my job, you really have to be a stand-alone optimist.
I always work thinking that the next fabulous image that will serve my purpose is ready, right behind the next reef, in the heart of the next lagoon, or who knows, maybe in the next one.
When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the heart of the country's national health policy.
The new government was emerging from a long war of independence and immediately announced a socialist agenda: health services, primary education became essentially free.
A significant expansion of rural health centres has placed about 80 per cent of the population within a two-hour walk of one of these centres, a truly remarkable achievement.
In 1980, the year of independence, 25 per cent of the children in the country were fully immunized.
In 1990, a decade later, that proportion was 80 per cent.
I felt extremely privileged to be part of this transformation, a revolution.
The excitement, the comradeship, were palpable.
By working with brilliant people, scientists, doctors, activists -- I felt connected not only to an African independence movement, but to a progressive global public health movement.
But there were considerable challenges.
It reported its first case of AIDS in 1985, the year I arrived.
I had taken care of a few AIDS patients in the early 1980s, during my medical training at Harlem Hospital, but we had no idea what was waiting for Africa.
My first days there, the infection rate was 2%.
It was going to skyrocket and reach one adult in four by the time I left Harare, 17 years later.
In the mid-1990s, I had announced to hundreds of people in their life as their HIV.
I had seen friends and colleagues die, my students, patients in the hospital.
In response to that, my colleagues and I set up a clinic.
We were demonstrating the use of condoms.
We have launched school education, work-based interventions.
We were doing research. We were giving advice to the partners of infected men so that they could protect themselves.
We worked hard, and at the time, I thought I was doing my best.
I was providing an excellent treatment, as good as possible.
But I was not talking about structural change.
The former UN Secretary, Kofi Annan, spoke honestly about his personal failure that led to the Rwandan genocide.
In 1994, he was the Director of the Peace Department at the United Nations.
In a memorial 10 years later, he said, "At the time, I thought I was doing my best, but I realized after the genocide that I could and should have done more to sound the alarm and gather support. ”
The AIDS epidemic caught the health community by surprise, and today, when the World Health Organization estimates that 39 million people died as a result of this disease, I'm not alone in feeling remorse and regret that I didn't do more, earlier.
But when I lived in the country, I didn't see my role as a defender or a politician.
I was there because of my technical skills, my clinical skills and my epidemiological research.
For me, my job was to take care of patients and do research to better understand the patterns of transmission within the population, and I hoped that we would slow down the spread of the virus.
I was aware that marginal populations were very likely to have and die from AIDS.
And in sugar plantations, which closely looked more like feudal fiefdoms than any modern company, 60 percent of pregnant women had HIV.
I worked to show that being infected was not a moral failure but rather linked to a culture of male superiority, forced labour of immigrants and colonialism.
Whites were largely spared.
As health professionals, our tools were pitifully weak: imploring people to change their individual behavior, to use condoms, to reduce the number of partners.
Infection rates were rising. And when treatment was available in the West, treatment that remained our most powerful weapon against the virus, it was not affordable for the African public sector.
I have not denounced the unequal access to these life-saving medicines or the underlying economic and political systems that raised infection rates among large groups of the population.
I rationalized my silence by thinking that I was just a visitor to this country, that the alarm could make me expel, prevent me from doing my job, taking care of my patients, carrying out such necessary research.
So I didn't revolt against the government's initial position on AIDS.
I did not express my concerns out loud.
Many doctors and health professionals may think I haven't done anything wrong.
Our pact with our patients, the Hippocrates' oath and its variants, evokes the inviolability of the patient-doctor relationship.
I did everything I could for every patient I had.
But I knew that epidemics appear along the cracks of our society, reflecting not only our biology, but more significantly the patterns of marginalization, exclusion, discrimination related to race, gender, sexuality, class, etc.
That was true for AIDS.
This was true recently for Ebola.
Medical anthropologists like Paul Farmer, who worked on AIDS in Haiti, called it "structural violence." Structural because inequality is embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world, and are often invisible to people privileged and in power; and violence because its impact -- premature deaths, suffering, disease -- is violent.
We do little for our patients if we do not recognize these social injustices.
Sounding the alarm is the first step towards good public health practice, and that is how we could bring back the support to revolutionise and create change together.
Today, I don't stay silent.
I'm talking about a lot of things, even if they make them uncomfortable, even if they make me uncomfortable.
Much of what I say is related to racial differences and institutionalized racism, things that are no longer supposed to exist in this country, let alone in medical practice or public health.
But they exist and we pay them by shortening lives.
That is why heals the alarm about the impact of racism on health in the United States, the current institutional and interpersonal violence facing people of color, mixed with our sad legacy of 250 years of slavery, 90 years of Jim Crow and 60 years of imperfect equality, sounding the alarm about this is fundamental to the successful completion of my work as New York City Health Commissioner.
In New York, premature mortality - either die before it reaches the age of 65 - is 50% higher for black men than for white men.
In 2012, a black woman was 10 times more likely than a white woman to die giving birth.
Although we have made enormous strides in reducing infant mortality rates, a black baby is always nearly three times more likely than a white baby to die in its first year.
New York is no exception.
These statistics are compared with statistics made across the United States.
A recent analysis by The New York Times pointed out that there was, in the country,
1.5 million black men missing. They mentioned the fact that more than one in six black men who were now between the ages of 25 and 54 were no longer living a normal life, but was in prison or died prematurely.
There is a great injustice to the daily and disproportionate violence against young black men, which is being paid to the recent protests by BlackLivesMatter.
But we must remember that disparate rates that persist and the occurrence and outcome of common diseases – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV – diseases that can kill gently and silently and take even more black lives prematurely.
When the 'BlackLivesMatter' movement took shape, I was frustrated and angry that the medical community was reluctant to use the word "racism" in our research and work.
You must have felt something every time I said it.
Our students participated in white gown demonstrations, but the majority of the medical community has stood aside while current discrimination continues to affect the pattern of disease and mortality.
And I'm afraid that the fashion of personalized and accurate medicine, the search for biological or genetic targets for a more appropriate treatment, could inadvertently make us lose sight of the global situation, that is, the everyday context, where a person lives, grows, works, loves, fundamental factor in determining the health of the population: for too many of us, poor health.
As health professionals, in our daily work, whether in practice or in research, we witness a great injustice: the homeless who are unable to follow medical advice because they have other priorities; transgender youth who think of suicide because our society is too rigid; the single mother who is being blamed for the poor health of her child.
Our role as healthcare professionals is not only to treat our patients but to sound the alarm and promote change.
Whether it is legally or not, our position in society makes us very credible and we should not spoil that.
I regret that I did not take the floor in the country, and I promised myself that, as New York City Health Commissioner, I would use every opportunity I would have to sound the alarm and get support for health equity.
I will denounce racism, and I hope you will join me, and I will join you in denouncing sexism or any other form of inequality.
It is time to stand up and, as a community, denounce structural inequalities.
We don't need to have all the answers to call for change.
We only need courage.
The health of our patients, of all of us, depends on it.
By show of hands: How many of you have already deleted a Facebook friend because he had made an offensive remark about politics, religion, parenthood, food?
How many of you avoid at least one person just so you don't have to talk to him?
Before, to have a polite conversation, we were following with Henry Higgins' advice in "My Fair Lady": sticking to the weather and your health.
But these days, with climate change and the anti-vaccination movement, these subjects... are no longer very safe.
The world in which we live, this world where every conversation can potentially evolve in controversy, where our politicians cannot talk to each other, and where even the most futile subjects have supporters and detractors, this world is not normal.
Pew Research did a study of 10,000 American adults and found that we are now more polarized, more divided, than ever before.
We make fewer compromises, which means that we are not listening.
We decide where to live, who to marry and even who are going to be our friends, according to our already established convictions.
Again, that doesn't mean we don't listen to each other.
A conversation requires a balance between speaking and listening, and, somewhere on the way, we have lost that balance.
This is partly due to technology.
The cell phones that you all have, either in your hands or close enough to be able to catch them quickly.
According to Pew Research, about a third of American teenagers send more than 100 times a day.
Many of them, the majority in fact, are likely to text their friends rather than talk to them face to face.
There's a great article in the magazine "The Atlantic"
written by Paul Barnwell, a high school teacher.
His students made a communication project.
He wanted to teach them how to talk about a particular subject without notes.
He said, "I realized... ”
“I realized that the ability to hold a conversation is perhaps the most neglected skill to teach.
Children spend hours interacting and making ideas via screens, but they rarely have the opportunity to refine their interpersonal communication skills.
It may sound weird, but one has to ask: in the 21st century, what skill is more important than knowing how to have a coherent conversation?
My job is to talk to people: Nobel laureates, truckers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, plumbers.
I talk to people I like and others I don't like.
I talk to people with whom I strongly disagree.
But I still have fantastic conversations with them.
For the next 10 minutes, I'd like to teach you how to talk and listen.
Many of you have already heard advice on this: looking people in the eye, thinking beforehand about interesting topics to talk about, looking, nodding and smiling to show your attention, repeat what you have heard or summarizing it.
Forget about all of this.
It's shit.
There is no reason to learn to demonstrate that you are paying attention, if you are indeed careful.
I use exactly the same skills as a professional interviewer as in my daily life.
So I'm going to teach you how to question people and it's going to help you learn how to be better communicators.
Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time, without getting bored, and above all, without offending anyone.
We've all had extraordinary conversations before.
We got them. We know what it is.
The kind of conversation that makes you feel involved and inspired, or that makes you feel like you've really created a bond, or you've been perfectly understood.
There is no reason why the majority of our conversations should not be that way.
I have 10 basic rules. I'm going to explain them to you, but honestly, if you take one and master it to the fullest, you'll already have better conversations.
Number 1: No multitasking.
Not just put your laptop, tablet or car keys, or what you have in your hand.
Be present.
Live in the moment.
Don't think about the argument with your boss.
Nor what you're going to eat tonight.
If you want to end the conversation, do it, but don't just be half present.
Number two: Don't give a lesson.
If you want to give your opinion, without any opportunity to respond, discuss, react or grow, write a blog.
I have a very good reason not to invite criticism to my show: they are very boring.
Conservatives will hate Obama, food stamps, and abortion.
Liberals will hate big banks, the oil industry, and Dick Cheney.
Completely predictable.
You don't want to be like that.
You have to start every conversation, with the idea that you're going to learn something.
Scott Peck, the famous therapist, said that for real listening, you have to erase yourself.
Sometimes it means putting aside one's own opinion.
He said that the speaker would feel that acceptance, and become less and less vulnerable and more likely to offer the hidden corners of his mind to the listener.
Consider that you have things to learn.
Bill Nye: "Everyone knows something you don't know. ”
I say this: each person is an expert in something.
Number 3: Ask open questions.
To do that, get inspired by journalists.
Start your questions with whom, what, when, where, why or how.
If you ask a complex question, the answer will be simple.
If I asked you, "Did you terrify?" ”
You're going to answer the most powerful word in this sentence, here "terrified," and the answer will be yes or no.
"Was you angry?" "Yes, very angry. ”
Let them describe them. They're the ones who know.
Ask questions like, "How was that?" ”
"What did you feel?" ”
Because they might need a moment of reflection, and then you'll have a much more interesting answer.
Number 4: Follow the flood.
It means that ideas will come to mind and you have to let them out of your mind.
We have often heard interviews where the guest speaks for several minutes, then the moderator takes the floor and asks a question that seems to come out of nowhere, or to which he has already been answered.
The moderator probably stopped listening two minutes before because he was thinking about his next question, a very clever question he was determined to ask.
We're doing the same thing.
We're sitting, talking to someone, and then we remember our meeting with Hugh Jackman in a cafe.
We stop listening.
Stories and ideas will come to you.
You have to let them come, then go back.
Number five: If you don't know, say you don't know.
People on the radio, especially on NPR, are more aware than what they say is recorded, so they are more careful when they talk about their expertise and what they are sure they know.
Do the same. Fish out of too much caution.
Speech should not be taken lightly.
Number six: Don't compare your experience to theirs.
If they talk about the loss of a family member, do not talk about the loss of a family member.
If they talk about the problems they have at work, don't tell them you hate your work.
It's not the same thing, never.
All experience is unique.
More importantly, it's not about you.
You don't have to use this moment to prove that you're awesome or how much you've suffered.
Someone asked Stephen Hawking for his IQ, who said, "No idea. Those who boast of their IQ are dumbs. ”
Conversations are not promotional opportunities.
Number 7: Try not to repeat yourself.
It's condescending and very boring, and we tend to do it.
Especially in conversations at work, or with our children, we have a message to go through so we reformulate it tirelessly.
Don't do it.
Number 8: Save the details.
Frankly, no matter what the years, the names, the dates and all those details that you can't remember.
It doesn't matter. What matters is you.
People are interested in you, in what you have in common.
Forget the details. Leave them aside.
Number nine: it's not the last one, but it's the most important.
Listen.
I cannot tell you how many important people have said that listening is perhaps the most important skill to develop.
Buddha said, and I paraphrases, "If your mouth is open, you don't learn. ”
And Calvin Collidge said, "No one was ever fired for listening. ”
Why don't we listen to each other?
First, we prefer to talk.
When I speak, I have control.
I don't have to hear what I'm not interested in.
I'm the focus of attention.
I can highlight my identity.
But it's not just that: we get distracted.
We say an average of 225 words per minute, but can listen to up to 500.
So our minds complement with 275 other words.
I know it takes effort and energy to give our attention to someone, but if you don't, it's not a conversation.
but rather two persons shouting related sentences in the same place.
You have to listen to each other.
Stephen Covey said this very well:
"Many of us don't listen to understand.
We listen to answer. ”
One last rule, number 10: be brief.
[A good conversation is like a miniskirt: short enough to hold attention, and long enough to cover the subject. "My sister, all of this comes down to a basic concept: take an interest in others."
I grew up with a very famous grandfather and there was a ritual in my house.
People came to talk to my grandparents, and after they left, my mother would come and see us and say, "You know who it was?"
He was the Miss America finalist.
He was the mayor of Sacramento.
She won a Pulitzer Prize. He is a Russian ballet dancer. ”
So I grew up believing that everyone has a hidden and quite awesome side.
I think that makes me a better host.
I keep my mouth closed as much as possible, I keep my mind open and I'm always ready to be amazed and I'm never disappointed.
Do the same.
Go talk to people, listen to them, and, above all, be prepared to be amazed.
Thank you.
Good morning.
My name is Matthew Williams, and I'm a champion.
I won medals at three different sports and national championships in Canada, played internationally in basketball, and I was proud to represent Canada on the world stage.
I train five days a week in basketball and speed skating, working with high-quality coaches and mental performance consultants to be the best in my sport.
Furthermore, I do all this with the Special Olympics.
Does that change the way you perceive myself and my achievements?
The world doesn't see people like me as champions.
Not so long ago, people like me were running away and hiding.
The Special Olympics have evolved a lot since the beginning in 1968, but too often people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to the general public.
People use the word "R" with me, and they think it doesn't matter.
This is the word “delayed” or “backward” used in a derogatory manner.
They can't imagine how much it hurts me and my friends.
I don't want you to think I'm here to be a work of charity.
I'm here because there's always a big problem with how many people perceive individuals with intellectual disabilities, or, all too often, how they don't see them at all.
Did you know that the World Championships took place this year?
I was among the more than 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries competing in Los Angeles.
There were over 62,000 spectators at the opening ceremonies, and there were TSN and ESPN to cover the event.
Did you know that this event took place?
What do you think when you meet someone like me?
I am here today to challenge you to regard us as equal.
The Special Olympics transform the identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the perception of anyone watching the competition.
For those of you who do not know, the Special Olympics are aimed at sportsmen and sportswomen with intellectual disabilities.
The Special Olympics are separated from the Paralympic and Olympic Games.
We offer high-quality sports programmes throughout the year for people with intellectual disabilities, which changes lives and perception.
This movement changed my life and so many other people.
And that has changed the way the world sees people with intellectual disabilities.
I was born with epilepsy and with an intellectual disability.
Growing up, I played hockey until I was 12.
The more I grew, the more I felt that it was harder to keep up with others, and I was pissed off and frustrated.
For a while, I didn't play any more sports, no longer had any friends, and felt forgotten and sad.
There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were hidden from society.
No one thought they could practice a sport, let alone be an important member of society.
In the '60s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, studied the effects of regular exercise on the physical condition of children with intellectual disabilities.
Using rigorous scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers concluded that it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate that led to physical fitness problems.
Many people doubted that people with intellectual disabilities could benefit from fitness programmes and sports competitions.
But pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of the Special Olympics, persevered, and the athletes of the Special Olympics proved them four and a half million times.
Before I joined the Special Olympics, I was nervous because I was young, shy, and had little confidence in myself and I didn't have many friends.
When I arrived, yet everyone encouraged me a lot, endured me and let me be myself unjudged.
Now I'm a basketball player and speed skater who has competed in regional, national games, and this year ended up at the Summer World Games in Los Angeles, where I was part of the first Canadian basketball team to compete in the World Games.
I'm one of the more than four and a half million athletes from all over the world, and I've heard so many similar stories.
Being an athlete at the Special Olympics gives pride and dignity.
The Special Olympics also address significant health needs.
Studies have indicated that, on average, men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years younger than men without men, and women with intellectual disabilities die 20 years younger than women without them.
The Special Olympics keep us healthy by making us active and engaging in a sport.
In addition, our coaches teach us nutrition and health.
The Special Olympics also provide free screening tests for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctor or accessing medical care.
At the 2015 World Summer Games, my teammates Canada and I were playing against the Nigeria team.
The day before our match, the Nigerian basketball team had come to the World Games Athletes to be screened free of charge to seven out of ten members and had the opportunity to hear clearly for the first time.
This change for them was unbelievable.
They were very excited, contented and confident, because their coaches could communicate orally with them.
And they were very moved because they could hear the sounds of the basketball, the whistle sounds and the enthusiastic fans in the stands -- sounds that we take for granted.
The Special Olympics do more than transform athletes into sport.
The Special Olympics are transforming their lives outside the field.
This year, research has shown that almost half of adults in the United States do not know a single person with an intellectual disability, and the 44% of Americans who do not have personal contact with intellectual disabilities are significantly less tolerant and positive.
Then there's the word "R," showing that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to far too many people.
People use it as a usual term or an insult.
He was tweeted more than nine million times last year, and it's deeply hurting me and my four and a half million athlete comrades around the world.
People don't think it's insulting, but it is.
As my fellow athlete and global spokesperson John Franklin Stephens wrote in an open letter to a political commentator who had used the word "R" as an insult, "Come one day join us at the Special Olympics.
You'll see if you go back with the heart unchanged. ”
This year, at the 2015 Summer Games, people lined up for hours before diving into the last night of weightlifting competition.
The evening was a pack when my teammate Jackie Barrett, the Newfoundland Elan, lifted 297 kg and 277 kg in squatters – setting huge new records at the Special Olympics.
Jackie is a record holder among all Newfoundland weightlifters – not just at the Special Olympics, but all the weightlifters.
Jackie was a huge celebrity in Los Angeles, and ESPN tweeted live its new record and was impressed by its performance.
Fifty years ago, few people imagined people with mental disabilities who could do something like this.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremonies of the World Games and applaud athletes from 165 countries from around the world.
Far from being hidden, we were applauded and celebrated.
The Special Olympics teach athletes to be confident and proud of themselves.
The Special Olympics teach the world that people with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and consideration.
Now I have dreams and successes in my sport, great coaches, respect and dignity, better health, and I'm pursuing a career as a personal trainer.
I'm no longer hidden, mocked, and I'm here giving a TED Talk.
The world is a different place thanks to the Special Olympics, but there is still work to be done.
So the next time you see someone with intellectual disabilities, I hope you'll see their talent.
Next time someone uses the word "R" next to you, I hope you'll tell them how hurtful it is.
I hope you will consider getting involved in the Special Olympics.
I'd like to leave you with a very last thought.
Nelson Mandela said, "Sport has the power to change the world. ”
The Special Olympics are changing the world by transforming four and a half million athletes and giving us a place to trust, meeting friends, not being judged and feeling and being champions.
Thank you very much.
No doubt you don't know Kenema in Sierra Leone, or Arua in Nigeria.
For me these are the two most extraordinary places on Earth.
There, in hospitals, there is a community of nurses, doctors and scientists who have calmly fought against one of humanity's deadliest threats in years: the Lassa virus.
The Lassa virus resembles the Ebola virus.
It can cause a high fever and can often be fatal.
But these people risk their lives every day, to protect individuals in their communities, and ultimately protect us all.
One of the most extraordinary things I've learned about them, during one of my first visits, a long time ago, was that they start every morning -- those difficult mornings on the front lines -- singing.
They gather together, and they show their joy and strength.
Over the years, we have visited each other. I could be among them, sing, and write. It was extraordinary, because it reminds us that we are not only here for science, but that we are bound by shared humanity.
You can imagine, it's extremely important, even vital, when things started to change.
The situation changed in March 2014, when the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea.
It was the first epidemic in West Africa, near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
It was scary... We were all terrified.
We had been suspecting for some time that the Lassa and Ebola viruses were more widespread than previously thought, that it could reach Kenema.
So members of my team immediately joined Dr. Humarr Khan and his team on the ground. We have put in place diagnostics to perform molecular tests that can detect the arrival of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
We had already managed to control the Lassa virus. We knew how to do it, the team was remarkable.
We just had to give them the tools and the lab for Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day has arrived.
On 23 May 2014, a woman arrived at the hospital's maternity ward. The team conducted molecular tests and identified the first case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
It was an exceptional job.
They were able to diagnose the case immediately, treat the patient safely, and begin to understand what was going on.
It could have prevented what happened.
But the day it happened, the epidemic had been smouldering for several months.
There were already hundreds of cases, surpassing all previous outbreaks.
It entered Sierra Leone, not as this singular case, but as a tidal wave.
We have worked with the international community, the Ministry of Health, with Kenema, to deal with cases. The following week there were 31, and then 92 and then 147 cases, they all came to Kenema, one of the only places in Sierra Leone that could solve this problem.
We worked tirelessly, trying everything possible to help every person, and try to get attention. We also did something else:
We didn't throw away the blood tests, used to detect Ebola, we put them in a chemical to turn them off. We packed them and shipped them across the ocean.
We sent them to Boston, where my team is working.
We have also worked tirelessly, day in and day out. We quickly generated 99 Ebola genomes.
The genome is the architect's plan for a virus.
We all have one.
It indicates what we are made of, and it conveys so much information about us.
The results of this kind of work are simple and very useful.
We took these 99 different viruses, we observed and compared them, and we found that, by comparing them to the three genomes that had previously been published in Guinea, the epidemic had emerged in Guinea several months earlier, and that, once in humans, it was transmitted from human to human.
This is very important when it comes to determining how to intervene, because contact testing is very important.
It was also discovered that the virus mutated by moving between humans.
Every mutation is important because diagnoses, vaccines, and our therapies are all based on genome sequence. That's the guide.
Global health experts need to react, develop and re-calibrate all their work accordingly.
But science doesn't work that way. My position at the time was that I had the data and I could have worked in a silo for months, analyze the data carefully, slowly, submit an article for publication, make some changes, and finally publish my data after the official publication.
That is how the status quo in science works.
This time, there is no question of doing so.
We had friends on the ground. For us, it was obvious that we needed help, a lot of help ...
The first thing we did, as soon as the machine took out the first sequences, was to publish them on the web.
We have published them and called for help.
And the help came.
Soon, a lot of people contacted us, surprised by the data we had published.
Some of the world's greatest infectious scientists were part of our community.
We were working together in a virtual way, sharing regular calls, trying to track the virus minute by minute, to see how to stop it.
There are so many ways to form such communities.
Everyone, when the epidemic began to spread globally, wanted to learn, participate, and engage.
Everyone wanted to play a role.
The number of volunteers was incredible, and the Internet was connecting us all.
Can you imagine that instead of being afraid of each other, we would say, "OK, let's go, while working together,
We're going to defeat this virus. ”
The problem was that the data we used, by searching the web, was too limited for our purpose.
We spoil a lot of opportunities in these cases.
So when the epidemic broke out in Kenema, we had 106 patient clinical records, and we made them public.
In our lab, we demonstrated that, with these 106 folders, we could teach our computers to predict Ebola with an accuracy of about 100 percent.
We've developed an application that gives access to this information to on-site health workers.
Unfortunately, 106 cases are not sufficient to consolidate and validate the data.
So we were expecting more data.
But we were still waiting for the data.
We are still waiting, confined in our silos, instead of working together.
This situation is no longer tolerable.
You, all of you, can't accept that anymore.
It is our life that is at stake.
Many people have lost their lives, health workers, including colleagues who were dear to me. Five colleagues lost their lives: Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi, Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Koroma and Mohamed Fullah.
These are just five of many others in Kenema and beyond, dead, as the world waited and we worked, quietly and separately.
Ebola, like all threats to humanity, is fuelled by mistrust, confusion and division.
As we build barriers between us, the virus develops.
Unlike all other threats, in the face of Ebola, we are all equal.
We're all on the same boat.
Ebola is on our every threshold.
And so in this place, we share the same vulnerabilities, forces, fears and hopes, I hope that we can work together with pleasure and pleasure.
One of my former students was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and she found out that the term "Kenema," the hospital where we work, in Sierra Leone, comes from Mende's quote for "clear as a river, translucent and open to glance."
It had a special meaning for us, because, unknowingly, we had always thought that to honor individuals in Kenema, we had to work openly and together.
We must do that.
We must all demand from ourselves and others, to be open to each other, when an epidemic occurs, and to fight it together.
Because it's not the first Ebola outbreak, nor the last, and there's a lot of other pathogens around us, like the Lassa virus.
The next epidemic could affect a city of millions of people.
It could start there and be transmitted by air.
It could even be intentionally disseminated.
I know it's scary, I understand ... but I also know, this experience proves it to us, that we have the technology and the ability to win, to win and get ahead of other viruses.
But this is only possible if we collaborate with joy.
For Dr. Khan, and for all those who have given their lives, on the front, in this fight with us, let us be at their side in this struggle. Always.
Let us not leave the world with the stigma of the destruction caused by a virus. Let's illuminate it with the brightness of billions of hearts and minds working in unity.
Thank you.
