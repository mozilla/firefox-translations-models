A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, claiming that voter fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
Moreover, Republican lawyers have identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will undermine some of the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of US governments enacted new laws starting in 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon gained momentum after the November 2010 elections, which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in 2011 alone.
The new election laws require voters to present photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.
These laws also reduce advance polling periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on election day, and strip citizens with a criminal record of their right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present photo identification.
Indiana was the first state to make such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law in 2008.
Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
For the past two years, they were sponsoring bills in 34 states to force voters to present photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11 percent of U.S. citizens, or 21 million voting-age people, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
Moreover, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity document.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
Much more.
Students, voters seen as voting more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their institution-issued photo ID.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs to vote.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
Separately, Republican lawmakers sponsored laws in 2011 abolishing voter registration on Election Day in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped register about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed legislation in five other states aimed at reducing the advance polling period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33 percent of electors who voted in advance polls were African-American, while they represented only 13 percent of voters in the state.
It was the same with Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
On the other hand, whites who made up 76% of voters represented only 46% of voters voting in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters vigorously opposed passing laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by vetoes by Democratic governors.
The U.S. attorney general intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit some of the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of photo identification.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and see it as an obvious objective to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that passed these laws account for 171 of the 270 votes the Electoral College needs to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, these measures will undermine some of the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: get tested or not?
Indeed, the PSA test would sometimes have erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
Enough to make men already reluctant to take screening tests hesitate even more.
To take the test or not?
We sought the advice of two experts.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, this one from Europe, found a difference in mortality between patients who were screened and those who did not.
This study also showed, with follow-up after 12 years, that we are between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if we are not detected.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
There is a real need to make the patient understand the degree of risk of their cancer, by giving them the options, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not interfere with long-term life, and by opting instead, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who are found to have cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and not life-threatening.
We will suggest that they do active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we will offer them treatment.
Increasingly, criteria are being determined precisely to decide who should or should not be treated.
So I still recommend taking the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine if you should have it or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to assess the pros and cons of PSA testing.
The document can be downloaded (in English for the time being, a translation will be available shortly) at: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening
Preventing disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting good lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked anymore, this rate would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many also remain totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
It is very detrimental to people's health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouragingly, 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying from cancer drops by half.
Weight
Being overweight and obese also contribute to the onset of the disease, according to the CCS.
They would increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer," it adds.
Food
The organization also recommends limiting your consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities, it increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer.
Cold cuts too, and they should be avoided.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"These can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," it explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at this time.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CCS.
While one of them noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also unclear.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Getting tested doesn't give cancer."
The dissected Higgs boson
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created quite a stir last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, no less.
And then, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model – our best, or "least worst" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter – but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it is indeed the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we are holding an authentic new particle, and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but there is still a lack of data to be perfectly certain.
Let's assume that it is indeed the Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem slim, and let's see what it is.
There is, in this world, a fatally inescapable law according to which two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
But even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting roughly of some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner there are good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least, not for this principle, which means that they can indeed be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons then divide into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure, Berkeley Laboratories: mesons, which we will not discuss here, and "force particles", by which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, it must be emphasized here, are not all critters as exotic as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this column, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field in that precise place, a bit like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "disturbance" arises an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and therefore, one of the "force-bearing" bosons.
More stable field
The same is true with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, that must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; To excite it, you have to reach very, very high energies, a bit like a frozen pond where only a very large rock could wrinkle the surface.
That's why you need a huge particle accelerator like CERN's - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring 27 km in circumference! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
Not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don't – a piece of paper, for example, will never stand on its own on a fridge.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have mass, while others (like the photon, hold on) do not.
Now, what "can all this research bring" asks, asks Ms. Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any discrepancies between observations and MS predictions.
Many of them fervently wish that we find them, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has huge deficiencies, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter in the Universe (re-oops!).
But no such discrepancies have been found at CERN so far.
Impact
The impact of this research on the daily lives of ordinary people is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be none.
Look: at the very beginning of the 60s, the pioneers of the laser, in Bell Laboratories, had no idea of the revolution that their work would trigger.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle – who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 – once told us that the laser was seen more as a "lab gadget".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the search.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work in optics.
This sensor, although it was not at all its original intention, now serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras in the world, and earned it the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it does mean that, really, you never know...
Palliative Care - The Best Way to Die... | The Duty
With its Dying with Dignity Commission, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
Debate is expected to resume shortly as a bill prepares.
However, in this crucial area, much remains to be done.
Le Devoir tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was eating away at him had given him a two-year respite.
"They gave me five years to live, I did seven years," he says, half-fig half-grape, lying in bed at the Victor Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for that," he says.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the toilet alone, and even from eating alone.
Seated in front of an appetizing lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even manages to smile, talks to strangers around him, brings him his medicine, offers him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is for me to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this ailment.
"During our lives, we learn that a man pisses standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Maison Victor-Gadbois.
Regressing to the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability" to accept regression, he says.
Because, in the opinion of many people working in palliative care, great moments are taking place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients who enter the Victor Gadbois Palliative Care Home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life prognosis of three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides so-called "curative" care.
For Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "conscious and suffocated".
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't have any wishes in life anymore," she says, before agreeing to be put on a mask to help her breathe.
She is still waiting, in the coming days, for a last visit from her son from Italy.
At Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers provides body care and food assistance.
It is palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little when you know that we all end up dying one day.
Here, life goes on in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the house's doctors.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person will be willing to provide mouth care with brandy or Pepsi, depending on demand.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, Mr. X, who died during the night, was served a beer.
This morning, it is his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help loved ones as much as patients," says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
At Maison Victor-Gadbois, the days follow one another but are not alike.
Alongside a 93-year-old man enjoying his last family gathering in the courtyard, propped up in his pillows while toasting in his honour, a 36-year-old man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after trying everything to survive.
"For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to Maison Victor-Gadbois arrive from home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the terminal stage of his life, whether at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as Maison Victor-Gadbois and the Société de soins palliatifs à domicile du Grand Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is precisely this major deficiency in Quebec health care that makes many doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care luminaries including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health care system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone will have the right to quality palliative care before euthanasia is agreed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency room, in great pain, without being done to relieve her.
I am concerned that patients will only ask to die because they are not receiving proper care.
And at the same time, many oncologists are persecuting their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard's hopes of survival were already minimal when she abandoned a gruelling chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment, she said she regretted that I stopped fighting," she said.
Still, she told me I was finished!
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank caregivers for not acceding to their request after they were relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Palliative Home Care Society of Greater Montreal, patients are refractory to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which amounts to putting the patient to sleep until the time of death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of the suffering.
More and more, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me," it means "I want relief."
This story was made possible thanks to a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction contractors, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell day after day what they know about a formidable "system", mixing construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
An "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers dearly, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has crumbled since we took the big means," said Jacques Duchesneau, MP for Quebec City and former police chief of Montreal.
It was through him that the scandal broke in 2011, through a thorough investigation into embezzlement related to road work contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal premier at the time, Jean Charest, had only consented backwards.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, hidden party financing and corruption of public officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he points out, the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars on contracts", some restraining their instincts to receive a share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will succeed in "demonstrating the stratagems behind individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also working on this with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
Plus the police officers of the "hammer squad" who, since 2009, would have led the "sewer cartel" of Montreal to put the pedal soft on the inflating contracts...
In recent weeks, it has conducted serial raids and brought charges of fraud and corruption against elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third-largest city.
He is suspected of having pocketed repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Montreal road engineers and Italian-born contractors, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, are also formally charged.
The latter caused a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who paid the money to Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito sowed all winds in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the Liberals then in power.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal deputy premier Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts whose costs he inflated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was working smoothly.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, detailed it well before the commission: in ten years, he received from construction companies gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totaling $ 736,000, in exchange for sewer contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other road officials have confessed to having been greased by inflating bills by 30% to 40%, by false extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget feeding his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected officials in Montreal to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the borough of Rivière-des-Prairies, east of the island, she rebelled in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought $ 5 million and resold... 1.6 million to developers, in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% dirty money in election campaigns
Of the investigation that will finally be set up, she says she is "pulling on a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and pin the culprits".
The process, she says, is "painful but positive."
We are cleaning up the wound, but we need a specific investigation unit in Montreal and a watch, so as not to see the return of questionable practices.
As we clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part that "civil servants have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially worried about the role of "elected officials aware of the stratagem", when they did not dip into the scheme!
Estimating at 70% the share of dirty money in the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $ 100 but this will not change the situation, according to him: "As long as we do not strictly limit election spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a complete overhaul of the system for awarding public contracts and party financing: "We cannot go any lower; Getting to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house on a firmer foundation, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I progress alongside them.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And, in matches, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I'm not getting fired up.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training centre to my time in Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed in stages.
So you take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's rookies are used to playing very high-level games.
They also know that every workout is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot in terms of my positioning.
He is supported by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti commands respect in all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience and has won a lot of titles with posh clubs.
He rubbed shoulders with great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a heartwarming discussion with him.
I was coming out of a series of injuries.
The trust he places in me also explains my performance.
How do you view PSG's first half of the season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our place as leader.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th finals with the manner.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
Now anything can happen.
But we will have our say against very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, ahead of Porto, to be able to receive in the 8th of final return.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and be sustainable.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, PSG is giving itself the means to make this project a reality.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we are really keen to pocket this championship title.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we are supposed to be champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It's normal that a lot is expected of us given what has been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept that.
Afterwards, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to reproach us, it's sure that it's a little frustrating.
One wonders what more people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We try to set up a game project.
A team is built over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we could be there.
Look at Manchester City who cannot, for two seasons, qualify for the 8th final, they have also made huge expenses!
In view of the sums invested, we imagined you with 15 points ahead at the break!
It was neglecting our opponents and the France championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
It shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up winning.
PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better to say that there is a "Zlatan dependence".
It means that Ibrahimovic is very efficient and that he scores a lot of goals.
He came for that and he proves that he is the star of Ligue 1.
He has shown everywhere he has been that he is a great player, a global star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He, too, respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the France team?
Like a disappointment.
I was keen to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from picking up playing time.
I saw things there and came out stronger.
Today, I manage to achieve good matches in the national team.
This is what I hoped for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine and we must now behave in an exemplary manner.
How do you view Didier Deschamps' first months at the head of Les Bleus?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires to win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead Les Bleus to Brazil.
Is the good draw (1-1) snatched on October 16 in Spain a founding match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this clash in Spain, I had never experienced a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as is often the case in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files peer-to-peer.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, before returning today around ten dollars (prices are listed on the bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing very impressive, compared to global exchanges in real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency," "competing with the dollar or euro," and "similar to conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to progress in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But each time, a central authority controls and processes the exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are both custodians of the ledger, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually between two email addresses like an email.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a dual-key encryption system.
This allows the network to verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged exist in the public account book, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It involves solving a mathematical challenge to computers, whose winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a file hashing phase, which is the transformation of a large file into a shorter, unique digital fingerprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "chopping" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular imprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is the correct one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; Any changes would change the footprint.
If, to fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaned because both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this award is halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, which leaves room for ...
The difficulty of the challenge is also met with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had its ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in deposits stolen.
"The flaw used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on money laundering opportunities through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this flaw.
Major players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the account book and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "giant sales" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement at merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
All they have to do is communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to take hold, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB also plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, if this currency succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain its territory and for Afghans to choose their future, without expecting everything from us.
It is mainly the Afghan peasants whom we have punished by considering them terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have taken refuge in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign armed presence, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes helped by local insurgents, they will no longer be when Westerners are more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was done in order.
Convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked, overflown by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban surge into Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country on fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former mujahideen, Afghan government and current Taliban come together in the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into businessmen, seizing government land and selling it as building land to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge US subcontracts.
They have discredited themselves; Most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have benefited from American largesse: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have rubbed shoulders with the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have appreciated its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has a population of 5 million, one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities, government schools are full of girls and boys alike.
It will be necessary to provide work for these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including armed opponents, is fond of mobile phones; Television, and its Turkish soap operas that present a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who will order it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already preoccupied with reconstituting provincial militias, which will escape the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization, like Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of Prime Minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially in the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country is, since the 50s and already well before, dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been restarted, no dams are in repair, no major irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; Nothing is produced, except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
There were rumours that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that Westerners were only there to seize it.
Without energy to process iron or copper ore locally, or transportation to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the huge Buddhist site and remain the province's largest employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports largely depend, will also have to re-establish normal relations one day.
The departure of the French fighting troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' and boys' high school, French department at university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and achieve the impossible task of matching aid and offensive actions, a "civil-military actions" service of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, has carried out, and had a small French NGO carry out, many works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, which require local labour, were able to help contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and an increase in arable land.
What will we leave as a memory, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys often located at more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurgency led by foreign groups, which I have told farmers want, they should have a small amount of civilian aid, well controlled and which affects them directly.
A forceps constitution in Egypt
This is a new poker move by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants him full powers, he has decided to play his part.
Taking everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State gave this Assembly two more months to finish its work.
For almost two years, Egypt has relied on a provisional text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only widened the divide in the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "betray his word" and "trample on the law".
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end as quickly as possible the institutional and political crisis, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within two weeks.
A very short period of time that forced the Brothers to abandon their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while protests rage throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote in favour, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Especially since this recourse to a hasty vote is an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, or I keep full powers", which supposedly have to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, with a large Islamist majority, voted for the text yesterday.
Most Liberals were missing.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, believing that they had not been able to assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society had done likewise.
In order to ensure that the necessary quorum was reached, 11 people, alternate members, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles were voted.
Commentators were also amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day was expressed around ... The time of prayer, some members of the committee believing that the pendulum of the constituent assembly was badly regulated.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, contains 234 articles.
Object of all attention, Article 2 ultimately remains identical to that of the Constitution of 1971, stipulating that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major demand, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules", which would have allowed stricter enforcement.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," say the liberals, who see it as only a publicity stunt.
Because according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer in particular to Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying the conformity of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people called to vote are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see in it the beginnings of a theocracy."
Liberal fears are further fuelled by the fact that the next president of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil registry.
Most of the jurists who worked on this text are not ulema but academics, some of whom were trained in the French system," said Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on Egypt's constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that "there may be ambiguity around Article 220, because the terms used borrow from religious vocabulary.
It refers to "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, editor's note].
And the question may arise in the future as to what extent civilian judges are competent to rule on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another point of contention is the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will trials of civilians in military courts, as requested by human rights groups, be banned.
The latter also express their concerns about the text, which they consider repressive.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, particularly of the press.
Moreover, no article more echoes the protection of women, said Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In her view, the only positive point was the prohibition of torture in Article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, holy sites, the Center of the World and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comforts and wilderness.
Argoumenty i Fakty has identified five main reasons for you to visit Israel.
Go and worship the holy places
A must-see event: the banks of the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that whoever enters these "baptismal funds" will be touched by divine grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of Jesus' miracles: where water was changed into wine, where Jesus walked on water, where he calmed the storm or where fishing was miraculous.
It was here that Jesus appeared before His disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places is in Jerusalem.
Believers walk along the Street of Suffering or the Way of the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the Antonia fortress (the praetorium), where the trial was held, then leads through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, and then to that of the Stone of the Anointing and the Entombment.
It is here that the Christian center of the world is located, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to Christian legend, the Monastery of the Cross is erected on the spot where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest place for Jews: the Western Wall which is the remnant of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave small notes accompanied by prayers that are then answered.
Travel high up
Visit the ruins of the Masada Fortress, an ancient refuge from enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC. for his family.
These ruins lie on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can get there on their own.
For the others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m above sea level, is the ski resort of Mont Hermont which welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle bus can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
Old beliefs have it that pagan gods once inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country is home to nearly 300 museums.
It is impossible to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are definitely worth seeing.
First: the Israel Museum located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the very ancient Qumran Scrolls, or Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
It mainly exhibits the paintings of the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of casts of visitors and supervisors of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures by Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum or Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which looks back at the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the children's memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and enter into total darkness.
Stars twinkle.
You then hear the names of Jewish children and the names of countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
Israel's three major resorts lie on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, because the water temperature does not drop below 21 ° while that of the air can reach 23 °.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, this is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, which is 417 m below sea level.
The azure-colored water contains brine and very easily holds bathers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes that surround it are of surreal beauty.
People come here to carry out a treatment based on salt water, silt, healing mud and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of antiquity
They are guarded by Tel Aviv's Old City, Jaffa, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived here a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk through the narrow alleys that are named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile on you.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds who come to do photo shoots from all over Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater, "conquer" the fortress of the crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to tourists
If you're going to Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer dollars to the euro, because they are easily exchangeable into shekels (today 1 dollar equals 3.8 shekels).
As for urban transport, it is mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and capable of connecting the lower and upper parts of the city.
It is almost an underground funicular.
The ride on all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition is to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport cease their activity.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants, and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales, and dishes consisting of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also hummus, traditional Jewish paste, different sauces, ground chickpea balls, falafel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats who walk around looking haughty.
They can be seen sleeping on the roofs of parked cars in the evening.
These felines love places passing by and do not refuse to be feasted.
Car rental varies depending on the brand from $37 for 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 per day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The language of numbers
Three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mostly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Who language has, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists debate what the mandatory language test law will do, fraudsters selling "fake" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to earn money to help their families back home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force stipulating that every migrant worker will have to pass a Russian language test.
At this time, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the service, housing, personal services and retail sectors.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, testing will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the History of Russia and the foundations of law.
You will have to validate your language skills in Russian to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has the status of an official language are exempt.
Persons who obtained teaching certificates or diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not affected by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other higher education institutions of Russia.
Immigrants will be able to take the exams in all cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders had already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what will it look like?
What will the requirement to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, say the representatives of the migration service, it will reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery at work".
Many talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, says Victor Sebelev, director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev certifies, the would-be migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "journey" to an overcrowded cottage where he and dozens of his ilk will torment themselves for months without food and papers and will have to toil between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"At home, they are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, their passports are taken, and they do not receive the expected salary," confirms the head of the Directorate of Migration Services for Labour of the Migration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't argue with me, Mr. Policeman!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to come and earn money in Russia confide that they not only do not know the language of the country they wish to visit, but also that they have difficulty writing in their own language.
This is of course not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even a passable primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have enough to feed their children let alone dress them properly and equip them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people leave to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's difficult when you don't know the language, they say.
"You feel diminished and diminished."
Human rights advocates, however, note an important aspect of the language law.
The exams will be for migrants who have legal status only.
Without status, there will be no formal examination or work thereafter.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbid to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
And then one can get a fake registration quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we have no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
"They ask us for 100, 200 rubles, enough to buy cigarettes, tea," Umed Khushkadamov, a national of Tajikistan, told reporters.
"Hurry, don't skimp and buy yourself a beautiful work of art"
From the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was discovered that it was not only the migrants' registration papers that were fake.
Several fake language exam certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
Forged papers come out of a regular colour printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: each migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of the examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Officials and human rights advocates agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "pieces of paper".
The authorities can give migrant workers who were unable to pass the exam the first time to attend language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in fields that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs is proposing to toughen the law against civilian weapon bearers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: from the shooting at weddings to the killing of Moscow jurist Dmitry Vinogradov, which left seven people dead.
The police want to ban the carrying of rubber guns in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a gun permit from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee for Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the weapons law would be introduced in the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is happy to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "tightening the screw".
An open letter has appeared on the Internet in which its authors, representatives of various firing centers, demand to abandon "this senseless hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC, told the Russian service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police department while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that strengthening civilian gun laws will not prevent criminals from sourcing from the black market.
According to them, today you can find in Moscow any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior claims that it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black market for weapons is supplied through several channels.
There are five main canals, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served ten years at the Ministry of Education and Headquarters.
Screenshot from a site taking orders for weapons
The first is the "military trace", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians," Baranets said.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals from law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these include weapons stolen from police stocks as well as weapons stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of the latter have often suffered explosions.
"Documented versions indicate that some fires were deliberately started to cover up the deficit," says the former soldier.
For Baranets, arms manufacturers have something to do with it.
"We see private arms factories that do not compete with the competition on the international market and sell weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," says an expert.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A significant proportion of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organizes the supply," adds the former soldier.
Where do the weapons come from?
The experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the military and law enforcement.
Half of the guns on the black market ended up there "through the fault of employees whose work is related to the weapons," the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% come from "clandestine excavations".
A salesman and consultant at an armory who asked to remain anonymous said that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these clandestine search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, he said, vendors pick up new goods from military warehouses.
The person buys through a sign a unit, for example a TT pistol.
It is delivered to him by passing the goods through a fence.
"He transports it to the city and sells it for €900 per unit with two chargers," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so when crimes are about to be solved, they make a control purchase from illegal arms dealers," the seller added.
" Like in a luxury boutique "
The seller and buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy came forward and offered me to come to the Begovaya station where someone became taking me to a "corner" to haggle.
The price of the gun, I was given it on the spot
Victor Baranets as a military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust them.
There are sellers in the markets, but there you also have to come and say, for example, "From such and such a person, who asked me to pass on that his daughter has lost a tooth".
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of someone I trust.
He only delivers them to me because he knows I won't give them away.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Victor Baranets tried his hand as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, he said, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "everything you want".
"I thought I was in a luxury boutique," recalls the soldier.
There is no secret for the buyer, explains Baranets, you can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don't just buy, we go with the seller in the forest and we install a target.
"They let me shoot and when I am convinced that the weapon works well, we start negotiating," the expert describes.
A shop from his sofa
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where one can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, we do not need any documents and no one to meet.
"It is enough to have a precise amount of money," one writes in advertising on the site "Buy a pistol or a combat submachine gun".
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we sell to miners?
"Without a license, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (spelling retained).
"Buy TT. Moscow," writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has disseminated a huge network of fake sites and picks up people who want to buy combat weapons in spades.
People rush for food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves mining coal in Siberia.
Victor Baranets, observer and former soldier
I have heard about this type of schemes: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People are taking the lead.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"In return, he receives a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, secretary of the Right to a Weapon association.
Victor Baranets says that by applying on the site, you can find yourself unarmed and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has disseminated a huge network of fake sites and picks up people who want to buy combat weapons in spades.
"People rush for food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves mining coal in Siberia", - he says.
A Makarov for $100
Buying an illegal firearm, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "Right to a Weapon", you can buy a Makarov pistol for 100-300 dollars.
It will take about a month and a half.
It is taken out of the long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official data of the Ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7% to 22.9 thousand, while the proven cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
United States: Fast-food and supermarket workers on strike
Nearly a quarter of U.S. teens go through a job as a cashier at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has mounted against low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will grow or run out of steam quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
Along with the increase in the modest wages received by rank-and-file workers at Walmart and fast food chains, the organizers of the protests are seeking the creation of unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", when a rain of sales seizing millions of inhabitants fell on America and sometimes triggering esclanders.
On that day, some workers at Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, quit their jobs to organize pickets with unions and left-wing activists in the company's stores whose products are aimed at low- and middle-class consumers.
Walmart markets everything from diapers and shotguns to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many low-paid Walmart employees shop only at their workplace.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheaply in part because of the low wages of its employees.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or hand-held scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" protests were demanding a pay raise, complaining that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the basic Walmart employee who earns $9.5 an hour, that's a sum he can't afford.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkley show that if Walmart raised the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
That's 1.1% more than he currently spends.
If Walmart shifted all the wage increases onto consumers' shoulders, each ride in the store would cost them 46 cents more.
They will spend in a year only $12.39 more than they do now.
Walmart supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did no harm to the group.
"Black Friday" continued in stores from 8 p.m. to midnight the next day, and Walmart sold 5,000 items per second over that period.
Its cash registers made a total of 100 million transactions for "Black Friday".
Company spokesman Dan Fogleman said in an interview with the left-leaning Huffington Post that "fewer than five" Walmart employees had left their jobs and that the protest was just one "communication operation among many" by the organizing union.
"Next customer!"
The protests continued this week in New York and were no longer about Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very popular, which is why they are not yet established there) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's advertises selling billions of servings and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you for the work you did honestly!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants increase them over time, but by a small margin, on average its basic employees in New York earn $8.90 an hour.
No one gets less than them in this city.
For me it is inconceivable to live with this sum in New York.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live on that salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum there are comments saying that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you are going to feed them with.
The protesters who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near McDonald's on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and cooks at the fast-food restaurant be paid a minimum of $15 an hour, a more than double the current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing it and punishing union protesters with bullying or firing.
However, the administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, taking over fast food remains a difficult task, and for concrete reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary turnover of staff.
They disagree
Other tumultuous protests were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the midday rally near McDonald's in Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic politicians, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's announces they are selling billions of servings and then they don't even give you sick leave and pay you for the work you did honestly!"
The protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, including mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio who said that "we must all support fast food workers to get the fair wage and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized the event as the largest in the history of the fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people participated, not all of them were fast-food workers, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is currently difficult to say whether this spark of mass movement will make babies.
"At the moment, we can only moderately deceive the brain"
Lately, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to perceiving augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google that unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November we learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it appears from the interview with Shahram Izadi, director of the interactive 3D technologies group at the Microsoft Cambridge Lab, that for the company's scientists, glasses are already history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has so far remained with pixels on flat screens and sometimes touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead of us and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today sells without Kinect because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What does the future hold?
- Although the Kinect has made the interaction physical, a lot of things happen on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information capture has been improved (the system receives more data), but performance at this time is not really important.
We're trying to change that and we're working on truly 3D imaging systems that work on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We have to bring the computer world out into ours, into the physical world, make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space around him.
Thus, we will be able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And for starters, let's get rid of those stupid VR headsets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It is appreciated, but is it not overrated?
We cannot say that this is a panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because we do not always want to inform others of our actions or intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the device's camera, but by a hand-worn bracelet that recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by mixed control, for example: gesture + voice.
- That is?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can?
You would do it with words and actions.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's going to be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt based on what the machine can or cannot do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
It can be for example laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what don't you like about modern cameras?
They lack resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we base ourselves in our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be nice to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, it adds work to algorithm designers.
We must keep in mind the resolution according to the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s is really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond lab, gave the touch of the sensors a regular processing delay of between 1 and 100 μs, with current sensors closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device of this type in my work, but not requiring touch, to have more frames per second.
- But shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- The Kinect today has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared emitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a usual visible field sensor.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a soft product similar to the Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how it could help define locations.
- As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the platforms with the most perspectives?
- Of course, walking around all the time with a smartphone with your hands raised is not practical but here's what I think: the best option would be a "transient" augmented reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch from glasses to smartphone.
Glasses are a very personal device and that's what makes them strong (personal elements are the ones you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mere mortal.
There is one problem that opponents of this idea point to : there is no tactile sensation!
The hands don't feel anything!
What responses is your group preparing in relation to this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
At the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image support.
It records the pressures perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really intended to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example the interference of several ultrasound rays directed at a precise point where the finger is located and which gives you the sensation, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the tips of the fingers.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a line of work with perspectives.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Make him believe that he feels what he should normally feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
There is still one task there that will have to be worked with for a long time: how to make someone who is physically in a very small space believe that he is walking in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of treadmills (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs),  mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For the moment, we can only moderately deceive the brain, there are still many years of work.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The St. Petersburg Avant-Garde" dedicated to city dwellers who are at the forefront, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already hosted prominent actors of the St. Petersburg art scene whose achievements go beyond the city's border and who have found recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extroverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, dressed all in red that can be seen near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or in trendy parties and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always gather crowds, regardless of where they are exhibited.
He is one of the fundamentally social and philosophical St. Petersburg storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took in his hands a barrel organ and he became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role by its existence, its philosophy and its bohemian image.
- Kirill, why do you travel the city all in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a couturier specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even if in society, anything that is not gray arouses aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize that you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my works were located.
I understood that this was my path.
Then, the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free, in my genre, were misunderstood.
I began to befriend the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevshchina which gave birth to "Puchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
- And all this ended up in your Art Clinic... - It was important for me to be in the center of St. Petersburg culture where the best creative forces must meet.
In 1995, I took my place in Pushkinskaya-10 which housed before the works a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the home of the bohemian St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Les NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arriving with the project "Van Gogh's Ear".
Chnour and his friends sang easy songs in playback in tight jerseys, they counted among them Igor Vdovin, a composer now in fashion.
When the band started performing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg hosted quite a few shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and then his great career began, but his training and basic education, it was with us that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboedov": these are repercussions of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees went there as regulars.
I am a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a poll was organized in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named "Painter of the Year", and that's when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your works are characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong topicality and acuity.
I will have a scheduled exhibition "The Russian Museum through Clowns".
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it's scary to be like this.
But with the clowns, everything disappears, the tragic falls.
I like the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory disguise.
Today, it is the dress that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but rather we have to spit on him.
And the lie will be erased by disguise.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the barrel organ player. - A cultural city must have this type of hero.
Who else but me can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today commercial art must be neat, delicate, sweet.
A disintegration of culture is occurring.
Before, people were divided into herds, the supporters of bohemia liked one thing, the denies another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you will like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we threw away who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 thousand will not come and in the end it is less management, money, everything withers.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually the ones we paint at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is spiritual culture, consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money precisely for painting.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, what is missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the cultural official.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the rule of the good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow today there are good consultants.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are being pushed aside because you need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and work their way.
Currently, it is the "reign of taste" that flourishes.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must find themselves from other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for it.
And on our stones, art has trouble growing.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, that's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who go to see exhibitions, concerts.
With us, this layer is very thin.
We must make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with earthlings on board go in search of a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how to continue to support our species in weightlessness or on a rescue planet?
I don't think there is much choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, if only by hypothesis.
"These are Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500.
You can only live there at very high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to focus on the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
Until half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from terrestrial varieties.
Then we put into orbit insects, small reproductive fruit flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how a weightless embryo developed.
At the exit, a completely normal chick is obtained.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is related to the fact that the chick has to find support, it has to get on its feet and start moving," says Vladimir Sychev, director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP).
Finding no support, the chicks were fidgeting in a disorderly manner.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
"We widened their eyes twice, then gave up, because it's just impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature ark" with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosatellite "Bion" will only carry species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetuses into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"It was still about biosatellites and then this is the only experiment. This kind of research needs to be done," Sychev said.
After landing, space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, it is not yet possible to make reproductions directly in space.
This is no small feat.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instinct.
Unlike beasts, man is capable of it, in principle.
Homo sapiens possesses abstract thinking, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experiment is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been going into space for 50 years now.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the feminine organism is the most precious thing humanity has.
Our seagull flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold out after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
"No one was answering that question," says Vakhtang Vachnadze, a retired rocket and space worker.
In June 1964, just one year after her flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a baby girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after being in orbit twice and even working in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, if not very few, cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during orbit flights," concludes pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Polyakov.
Yet humanity must look for new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravitation.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Center: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero buoyancy, cosmonauts train for spacewalks.
Water mimics weightlessness.
If for adults, water is comfortable but nevertheless a foreign environment, for infants, it is their true element.
The little amphibious men seem to confirm it: life on Earth originates from the ocean.
Since the baby evolves about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of his mother's womb, it is easier for him to get used to the water afterwards.
This is in principle logical, because from birth to his first bath, only 2 weeks pass.
"It's very little to forget," says infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the belly, pelvis atrophy very quickly, the baby's ability to push is lost.
Okay, let's ignore that by relying on birth simulators.
We can of course prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will manage to get him out.
"What's next?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite reflection on this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the earthly attraction, the organism does not form the skeleton or the muscular system.
You can't dress an infant like an adult with a special suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experiment that we would consider in this case imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a disabled child, entirely maladapted," predicts the Director of the Committee for Bioethics of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, in time this will become a reality, when Earthlings travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their space-born descendants.
The head of the SAI (Supreme Audit Institution) declared: "The control of pseudo self-employment (in Czech "Švarc system") has failed because of politicians.
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and high-quality legislation, but it lags behind in its implementation.
This was stated by Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Supreme Audit Institution in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its enforcement must be fair and, in my opinion, this is what is lacking in us," Kala said in his commentary on the current situation.
A joint monitoring by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites Petr Nečas' "Švarc system" approach as an example of abusive practice.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS is not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls; So is this allowed or forbidden?
"The law has to be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority in charge of going to inspect to demand compliance with the law," Kala said.
At the meeting of the Control Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-German project in which the public procurement legislation of these two countries was compared.
What was it about concretely?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and follows specific national legislation and practice itself.
We have put all this together, and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, some very interesting differences have arisen to us: generally speaking, our legislation may be 'stricter and of better quality', nevertheless, according to certain parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to continually develop more and more detailed rules, but that it is necessary to devote oneself to the actual implementation of the law.
How can this project help you concretely and what does it mean for you?
Joint monitoring of this kind should help us to stop trying to clarify laws, lower and improve thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtaining the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But lowering market thresholds will not necessarily achieve this goal.
It could be that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork, that those who look for loopholes will find many more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You talk about internal problems with the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our SAI or a different mode of organization?
As far as the institutions are concerned, like the SAI, the Bundesrechnungshof operates there, which is similarly organised, it also has a council constituted somewhat differently, but these two institutions basically proceed in a similar way.
The competences are also to some extent similar, albeit with one nuance compared to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has courts of auditors of this type at the level of the various Länder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which in our country is the resources of the state.
The public funds managed here by the regions and municipalities are controlled there at the level of the courts of auditors of the Länder.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I do not want to make a general comparison without concrete data, but in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model, but it certainly cannot be said to do better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better inspectors?
No, certainly not, but again, I do not have any comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we consider to be a model, is also facing a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage in cooperating with our institution, right?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has the amendment of the Public Procurement Act meant for you as an institution, are its effects already being felt?
As this amendment entered into force relatively recently, it does not yet have an impact on our control operations.
Since we carry out ex post controls, there is a certain delay.
Our observations concern only, for the moment, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument for 'detecting risks of mismanagement' with which we have screened nearly 14 000 public contracts - there these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed as well as the conditions of certain types of tendering procedures and so on.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law more as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration?
I believe that this legislation is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm that.
The problem that can arise is that these rules become stricter and it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulations, the service provider (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced the audited subjects to accept that any violation of the law on procurement meant a breach of budgetary discipline.
So is it really useful to make the law tougher in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system, but not punish those who make formal mistakes that have no impact on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS was not going to annoy entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or allowed?
The law has to be enforced in one way or another, so if it forbids something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from going to inspect and demand compliance with the law.
He can say, "We are going to change the law and allow it," but he cannot say that we are going to act as if nothing had happened.
The law on contracts contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be completed, precisely in order to protect the invitation to tender.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied fairly, and I think that is what we are lacking.
The roads are frozen in places, but most remain passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snow-covered.
However, the network remains largely passable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were passable this morning, but in places frozen and also snow-covered.
Temperatures have dropped and are hovering between -5°C and -10°C but they are expected to rise slightly during the day.
Snowfall has stopped in the region and only a thin layer of snow remains on the plains.
The ridges of the Ore Mountains (Krušné hory) are, however, covered with about 30 centimetres of snow.
Data from the Regional Road Maintenance Service indicate that fog meant reduced visibility in some places.
The R6 expressway and the national roads in the region are now passable without difficulty.
However, vigilance is still required, for example on certain bridges whose surface can be frozen and slippery.
All county roads and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
On some of their sections, there are still remnants of frozen snow and in places packed by traffic.
Especially in high-altitude areas, drivers need to be extra vigilant.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Directorate of Roads and Highways reports on its website that some roads in East Bohemia are threatened by ice and that layers of snow packed by traffic may be found on roads in mountainous and high-altitude areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of ice formation in high-altitude areas of the Pardubice region.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on county and third category roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads around Svitavy were chemically treated.
Snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov districts, a layer of traffic-packed snow is present on roads in high-altitude areas.
In East Bohemia, the weather will now be dry, mostly clear, with possible cloudy passages.
It will blow a light wind and temperatures will usually oscillate between -3 ° and + 1 ° C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are now passable, although in places it is necessary to be more vigilant and to adapt one's driving to the weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures oscillate between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the last snowfall and the subsequent cooling, some communication routes may be frozen in places.
Drivers can expect to pass through areas of fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what emerges from the information of the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 motorway is passable almost without difficulty, but the road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between kilometres 80 and 131.
The pavement of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections may be frozen in the South Pilsen district and the Tachov district.
The departmental and third category roads are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on less busy roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers travelling to high-altitude areas of the Olomouc region now have to rely on a layer of thick, soft snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the so-called "Červenohorské sedlo" pass and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after the chemical treatment operations.
Snowfall forced road maintenance personnel to the field overnight; according to the road authorities, more than three centimetres fell in the Šumperk district.
In other parts of the region, most roads are passable without difficulty.
"On the heights of the Šumperk district are remnants of snow.
Drivers travelling in the direction of Jeseník should expect to encounter a layer of thick and soft snow at the so-called "Červenohorské sedlo" pass," the head of the Šumperk district road maintenance service told ČTK today.
Their colleagues from Jeseník district also visited the site during the night; According to them, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are passable without difficulty, in the district of Šternberk drivers should however be careful in the sections in forest areas with roads that remain wet.
Regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
As early as this morning, the North Bohemian Road Maintenance Service reported several difficult sections.
Police data show that in addition to some places covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below freezing at lower altitudes, and therefore snow and ice are expected to remain on the roads. In the plains, especially in the south-east of the Central Bohemian Plateau, there are, on the contrary, no problems and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of ice, especially around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snowmelt during the day, clear skies and frost during the night.
Difficult conditions are also reported from the main roads on National Road 13 on the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to tree branches that have bent under the weight of the snow until they reach the roadway.
Šimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
This is just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our band The Tap Tap, we laugh about it and we say that we are the only band capable of collecting a remnant of positive energy in order to postpone or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you are putting together a very unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
This is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years now.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 am.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end almost by the end of the Mayan calendar on the Pacific Ocean island of Kiribati, 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, to reflect on the state of the world we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a collection of unique objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap with other performers also recorded an anthem against the end of the world entitled " End of the World Cancelled " (in Czech " Konec světa zrušeno ").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will we also hear it at these charity concerts?
Of course, at the very end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place...
It will be sung simultaneously by all performers in all three concerts.
The anthems will also come together at some point in a unique live broadcast on Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also plays the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings there...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other Czech showbiz personalities, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charity events...
We strive to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and it amuses them.
What will the profits of these concerts against the end of the world be used for?
To equip the Studeo training center, which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on as part of the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap association, and this for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedličkův Institute and offer them activities that interest and amuse them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Several bands and performers will take the stage at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria, did you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program that caters to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform on stage.
You will find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time as part of the Prague Spring; Here too, we will surely prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year in the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once there in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not as bad as it looks at first.
We have five members in electric wheelchairs whose machines have to travel in the hold, naturally we also carry a lot of luggage and boxes of instruments....
So far everything has more or less always gone well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Through your travels abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access for people with reduced mobility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have witnessed in Moscow that in the East everything is still in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very inaccessible to people with disabilities; There, it is not yet common for a person to move alone in an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider it obvious to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association is being set up to draw attention to the problems of disabled people.
How do we still need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are many things for which we are still late...
It is important to mention that improvements and refinements always depend on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move around alone in public spaces; They can go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not very common there that a large number of disabled people actively participate in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the forefront of progress!
Respect for the public and ease of access are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have famous sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or jurists among us.
At the moment, these are just isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people ready to invest in something.
And since I am a musician myself (I play, among other things, the saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, we lost control of the situation a little bit (laughs).
Success has only happened in recent years, am I mistaken?
It's true, connecting with well-known singers and actively working to promote the band helped us.
We understood that, if a work is not visible, it is as if it does not exist in the background.
Thanks to subsidies from the European Union, we can also afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was potential to change things.
Show business is full of stuff that copies each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
There are few original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural ...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, whom we must take pity.
These are people who can live a life in their own right and flourish, provided they have the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities manage to achieve something, it is not only a step forward for them but for society as a whole.
Isn't your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many areas and demand discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and their heads in the clouds, and when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the road for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
Only one, Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group, people come and go, there is nothing we can do about it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case on the eve of the scheduled day of the end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 pm.
This action will take place in Prague in the Inch arena, in Brno in Fléda and in Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world canceled" will be sung together.
The aim of the concert is to raise financial resources (up to 25 million CZK) to equip the multifunctional training center Studeo located in Prague in the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years, presale of tickets is open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency, it is the second member state of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started working closely with ESA in 1994 and in the years that followed participated in a number of ESA projects.
Poland's journey to space, however, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, passionate Poles were working on space flight; They did not always meet understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, A. Šternfeld's lecture at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his pioneering work entitled "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left listeners cold and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his book " Introduction à l'astronautique ".
The said doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote numerous books on this scientific discipline.
Gadomsky became a world-renowned propagator of astronautics, his contribution was rewarded in particular by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the far side of the Moon.
As early as 1925 a draisine was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the rocket was to be used to propel or brake the draisine.
The only known information about this draisine are those of the press of the time.
From 1933, Polish artillery began to focus on rockets.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It appears from the documents preserved that this research had reached the testing stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search stopped.
In 1937, plans for a photoelectric fighter rocket, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press, and the following year the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of rocket technology were carried out by the provisional scientific advisory committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war put an end to its activities.
After the war, further works on aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, a company was mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the newspaper Problem, which contained four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched, and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
In early 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to join the International Astronautical Federation (established in 1951) and by autumn the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed just under 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version, RM-1A, was built, and in the summer of 1959 flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket were begun in the Bledov Desert.
This rocket had a length of 1.4 meters and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to perform concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have had a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded the first RM rockets.
This rocket, designed with two stages, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; They were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space offering a volume of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these types of craft was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the Aeronautical Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this program.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on public works.
This decision provoked a lively debate in public opinion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberalism-oriented economic systems, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
In practical terms, this means that the various economic entities as well as the national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.
This results from the principle of free trade and free (limitless) movement of private capital combined with unbridled financial speculation.
Considerable differences in the price of labour (wages) generate pressure on prices.
The following meaning should be put under this term: a producer endeavours by importing low-priced goods to resist economic competition by "making the competitor's price more expensive", with the aim of taking away a larger share of the market and thus increasing his own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad, buy cheaply, or disappear. The result is high unemployment in countries with high labour prices compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the social charges of the State necessarily increase.
All this situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is so common knowledge that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create a situation in different economies in which the governments of different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to them.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without regard for social collapse.
This is mainly manifested in the amendments to the laws in force.
The aim is to force its own population economically to accept the price dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This occurs on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and on the other hand by the restriction of employees' rights in the field of labour legislation.
The result is growing poverty and deepening differences between rich and poor.
In the FRG, there have been public food distribution points for the poor who cannot support themselves with their own work.
There are already millions of such people.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is becoming quite common for employees to receive such wages that the state is forced to pay extra to reach the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal has come to light, for example, in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
The cost-saving measures of virtually all the southern Member States of the EU undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the nineteenth century) or to live on poverty wages, on the margins of society,  in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their country.
Here we must ask ourselves the following question: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or else a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media are tired of saying that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the command economy leads to economic catastrophe.
Private capital fiercely defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
We must then ask ourselves whether private capital does not influence and even direct today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same token, the entire state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The proof of this is that there is a practically all-powerful lobby present in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in the area of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is reprehensible but not punishable.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that, due to lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the preparation of draft laws to law firms closely linked to industry.
These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people, as Western-style constitutions declare, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberalism-oriented democracies are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled ' The crisis of the Roman Empire in the time of Caesar and Pompey': ' The state had long been in disarray and functions were assigned by violence.
Bribes, illegally obtained favors, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
Bribes and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with votes already sold"... ... "Honest people did not seek to obtain functions, it resulted once the state remained 8 months without consuls".... 'It really began to be said that the remedy for this difficult situation was autocracy and that an energetic man had to be chosen'. It is true that Appianos had Pompey in mind, but it was Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into an absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, today's society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interest of society as a whole.
At its core, private capital is no longer able to understand and assert the interests of society as a whole.
The result, today as in the past, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, without any effort to carry out in-depth reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
As things stand, the disappearance of these systems in favor of liberal-type democracies can be seen as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally and internally, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for ways to lower the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution is socio-political reforms that will strengthen state capital investment in the economy, increase citizens' influence on government, and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society to the benefit of the state.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never can," Sting says in the song titled Fragile, whose main verse of the chorus is "let's not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, there wouldn't be wars," said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild's wife on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, there have been many reactions.
Some take Israel's side, arguing its right to self-defense and placing Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel a terrorist state.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its recurring waves of killings; All in all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view "behind the curtain", on the one who mainly benefits from the tensions that have already persisted for more than 95 years (since the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available for study, others emerge from my own understanding of who, or more precisely the group of individuals, is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
In every era, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or owed their actions to the throne to someone who directed their actions according to previously defined goals.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration engendering certain powers could not have happened in a single generation.
Among the families with astronomical wealth stands out particularly the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
As early as the 90s of the nineteenth century, they acquired the world's leading news agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts in which they were involved and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their wealth or both.
They own major stakes in almost most of the world's central banks and are preparing or waging wars against countries in which they do not yet have such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4,  meanwhile Russia has placed the Russian Central Bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschilds' Bank of America as a central bank and began issuing his own money during the Civil War (governmental, I understand) and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
JFK started issuing clean money and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, Deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while trying to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Economic Crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the global level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated to the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war aimed to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to suppress colonialism, especially British, and the third should reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the beginning of such a solution) and,  In the end, acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families led by the Rothschilds is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the Fed to prevent the repetition of crises such as those they caused in 1907).
After successfully triggering the First World War with the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the Central European power.
For an easier outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers allowed the politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: they have, on the one hand, imposed on Germany huge war reparations thus generating the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished masses (it is then enough for them to place a sufficiently energetic leader, pointing the finger at the culprits,  proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a large German minority that was to play the role (which it effectively held) of fifth column to ignite the powder powder keg and start a war.
In the late nineteenth century, the Rothschields inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (back to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration laid the foundation for a mass emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
World War II broke out; it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had initially held him; or if everything he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the basis for acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the Second World War, the founding of the State of Israel lit a fire that could cause a third world war.
If the international bankers succeed in starting this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but internationally (just look at how people are bitterly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one wrong begets another wrong in an endless cycle of violence and where the greed of certain individuals and their desire to gain power over the whole world is at the root of everything?
Here we must differentiate between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as with us, international bankers only propose their own candidates to people in elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascistic politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything to start a war with Iran, which could, because of this country's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) expand into a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz through which 20% of all the world's oil passes (this naval corridor). is only 2 miles wide) and cause destruction of the global economy.
In what light now appear the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of financial aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth an electronic chip making him a totally controlled being.
"Let them compel all individuals, small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves, to bear on their hands or foreheads a red iron mark, so that they may neither buy nor sell the one that does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of its name.
It must be understood: let him who has common sense count the figures of this ferocious beast.
This number designates the man and it is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the American administration a positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages.
This was a blow to U.S. prestige, further compounded later by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their plight sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian debacle contributed heavily to Jimmy Carter's defeat by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode in this story that offered America a small victory.
Just before it was occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated adventures, they found themselves in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran thanks to incredible coverage: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a film crew who had come to scout for the shooting of a science fiction movie.
Combining genres
Exfiltration expert Tony Mendez's plan required the collaboration of Hollywood.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magazines reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is on the one hand a realistically conceived political thriller but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful coup, of a treachery - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen.
The atmospheres follow one another: documentary-style sequences of Tehran (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of the events and the way in which, thanks to these photos, these same situations were transcribed in the film, there are no big differences),
lighter passages from Hollywood, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration,
and then scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions with men in costume discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
From a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his acting stopped eliciting ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark detective "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It is also Affleck's first film not set in his hometown of Boston.
The sense of atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed his first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran "is held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; The initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also suggests the confusion and unpredictability that occurs when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the fake film crew in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to settle for a subject that actually offered few thrilling scenes, in the cinematic sense of the word.
He does very well, he sometimes adds certain elements to reality and there, the result is not always so elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is removed by a phone call to America and the pursuit on the airstrip are quite far-fetched).
Argo's weakness lies in its dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood cooperators, their characters would have deserved a greater place and they are not, far from it, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, he lets himself be seen with moderate interest, appreciating the filmmaking and retro style of the 70s.
He draws the viewer along, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a history still, in a way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated nature of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, it does the trick.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and the circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which conducts an annual public inquiry into the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the competition for the regulation or the most absurd ideas from the "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is considering, in recent times, adopting a quota of 40 percent of women for the management of large European companies was at the origin of our decision," the organizer of the survey, Patrik Nacher, told the newspaper Právo.
Among the absurdities mentioned, there is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, however, women have had an advantage in life insurance rates because they objectively represent a lower risk to insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such incredible ideas from the "EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the obligation to add bio components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers solely because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of hens' cages, which has led to an increase in the price of eggs.
Criticism has also been levelled in the past against the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the withdrawal from sale of conventional light bulbs.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters in size.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or group of states (for example, the Czech Republic currently imposes the demands of its banks by threatening to use its veto power).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, behind the fact that bananas in the Union must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was only harmonising non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
Standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite opposition from some states, claiming that existing directives lead to food waste.
The first prize may be awarded in this survey to last year's EU regulation that airbags must include a warning that children under 8 should not inflate unsupervised by adults.
The EU referred to a US investigation that found that balloons are the leading cause of death of children from suffocation among toys.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 from blowing fair trumpets.
At home, too, we have strange ideas.
The following rule regarding EU officials themselves is quite absurd: due to the sensitivity of this issue for Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name 'Macedonia' and must, instead, speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the association "Laissez Faire" of liberal economists, the Bankovnípoplatky.com server named in this survey, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the Union regulation on the volume of food reserves on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic, for example, then exceeded the fixed volumes for canned mushrooms and thus risked a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found interesting the idea of paying sums of money to certain countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy to apply for subsidies.
These ideas, however, did not originate in Brussels but in Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea handicaps us.
We will ask the European Union for a refund." So said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued that, because of our wheat production, and following the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the state had left itself with full stocks that it then had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and organized a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
The grants for obtaining subsidies were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), these were, concretely, to be used to draft applications for subsidies granted by Brussels.
The EU says: "bizarre regulations are rare".
While regulations are often criticised in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's functioning and in the area of its overall development deserve praise.
More serious, for example, according to experts, is the problem of using EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which were imposed by the Member States during the budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (a struggle from which it does not always emerge victorious) arouses strong emotions among the Czechs.
If, after six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky", as for the name "Tuzemský rum" which dates back to the nineteenth century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only products based on cane sugar alcohol, and not based on beet sugar, may be called rum.
In the official list of registered EU products, together with world-famous cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, you can now find Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham, Karlovy Vary biscuits ("Karlovarské suchary"), Pohořelice and Třeboň carp ("Pohořelický a Třeboňský kapr") and Žatec hops ("Žatecký chmel").
Pardubice gingerbread ("Pardubický perník") and cakes called "Cornets de Hořice" ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their Community trademark.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," says Senator Okamura.
Senator, how does one come up with the idea of running for president?
It is not being a senator or a president that matters to me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can no longer bear to see how the country has been plundered for the last twenty years, that thieves are not locked up and taxes and the retirement age are rising.
I didn't have the ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, then I try to provide a solution to change it.
And since I am over forty years old and I am independent, a member of no party, I have no other solution to influence the situation than to run for president or senator.
You entered the Senate but you quickly set off for the Castle.
Don't you turn your back on those who elected you?
I have always said that I will embark on the battle for the Castle according to the results of the senatorial elections.
Subsequently, I clarified that if I were elected to the Senate, I would run for president.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument allowing me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we moan at the bar or in front of our television set, but it is also that we trample on all those who are trying to bring about change.
Added to this is the press, which breaks people's reputations and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, it has been said that I bribe journalists or that I was an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's come to your visions.
You started the fight for the Castle with the themes of the material and criminal liability of politicians and retroactive tax declarations above twenty million [CZK] as your hobbyhorse.
To that end, you must change the law.
As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose legislation.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I lobbied for tourist guide activities to be a liberal profession, I won my case.
The problem is politicking: when someone comes from the left or the right with a good project, it is knowingly refused and it delays the citizens.
As an independent, a member of no party, I have a much better chance of getting the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without partisan categorization and dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you consider yourself more of a man of the right or the left?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people place me rather on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right but to bring people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I act just as impartially against bad ideas.
Do you get enraged when someone says you're a populist?
But doesn't what you said prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal purpose and vision.
You are trying to get closer to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about have been implemented by the world and recognized experts have talked about it.
But without the support of parliament, you are left with slogans.
You won't survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my camp in order to impose it.
If I were elected President, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal liability of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
They should then eventually explain why they do not want it.
When there is a strong personality who identifies abuses, it will be possible to exert pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president by direct suffrage, which was achieved through pressure from public opinion.
I confess, unequivocally, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I have just entered politics and I am trying to get majority support for my platform.
I am trying, on my own, to get things done, and if it doesn't work, I will stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's as if Okamura had to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that one person cannot tell the difference, which is why I went to a number of personalities to ask them to run for the Senate as well.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who exposed the fuel fraud.
I ran because people are really unhappy but now I'm hesitating.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what did, for the most part, gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are just two independents.
People have elected a Senate that will find it difficult to force change.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and regional prefects.
Are you planning to found your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if the past of each potential member is unblemished and then I don't have the financial means.
I also have no money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand in my "transparent" account.
Don't have money?
You talk about tax returns, what is yours?
I estimate the value of my personal assets at about $60 million.
I have a plot of land worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million in my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid's dream: I always loved James Bond, who drove a car, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have a wealth worth 60 million and you have no money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money in it?
It is not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for this campaign.
Should I go into debt?
I have already invested 2 and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that there is not much interest in my program.
I do not have to pay for this campaign out of my own pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I could not live on it, for example to pay for my son's English school which costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I would not run for office.
So you will continue your commercial activities to be able to live?
Didn't you say you would mute your activities?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take over the management of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live off something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I was winning and I continue to earn between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would cease my business activities.

MVRDV's architects prove that true adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To be convinced, just contemplate Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it's very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist at a large company nearby, tells us: "Yes, it is indeed very beautiful, this building".
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one willingly goes to one of those cheesy libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town that is not attractive on the outskirts of Rotterdam, holds a rather peculiar record.
The municipality of 80,000 people has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to general culture and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro notes in the form of pretty little miniatures in painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
That's how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to regain control of the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, a master of bold stick diagrams and creator of witty and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and entered the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a sneer on his face.
And while the jury members were still looking at each other, bewildered and shrugging their shoulders, Maas, the cheeky one, stacked his choice books in order of size to make a pyramid, and ended his speech supported by activist arguments with a: "dear commune!"
Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the €30 million mountain sprang from the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and some buildings and terraced houses for a total of 50 homes.
At the beginning of November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was shortlisted for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is how this small dull village, which until today had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a town hall of astonishing ugliness, whose white facades invite us to think that they house a dairy, has been enriched with a contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long road to reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
Certainly, an elevator transports you to the heart of the massif, but the true joys of reading and architecture open up to you when you tread the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior made entirely of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and elegant street lamps speak unequivocally the language of municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for public benches, dogs and little boys and girls playing ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Normally, the library shelves are along the façade and in the middle is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," says Willy Maas.
We have completely changed the classic spatial configuration and opened up the reading spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the book mountain has been skilfully laid out: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental center and the building technical center.
A particular beauty lies in the black shelves of the library, which are sometimes paneling, sometimes balustrades, sometimes stair railings.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even hardened architects and building engineers don't want unfamiliar materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
For example, one day we found an ad hoc waste from agriculture in a Frisian agricultural company.
In the Netherlands, the millimetre-thick synthetic membrane has been used as a substrate in greenhouses and fields for years.
It's cheap and time-saving.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons and then can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, whose smell evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 meters, the literary café offers us a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and ficus in pots.
The latter create an atmosphere, but above all they contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity in the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the new soul
"It's amazing, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books lies beneath a glass bell, the sun illuminates the interior for a short time, even on sunny days.
The thick wooden beams mounted askew from the glass façade serve as a sun visor, intercepting much of the rays.
The ambient atmosphere is very pleasant.
Fully automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic computer scientist, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was also already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as the "soul finally found" of Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, during the inauguration, each citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure made it possible to fill the gaps in the library, which was not yet fully stocked (today, it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The shelves are overflowing on all sides.
For architect Winy Maas, "there is nothing worse than a half-empty bookcase."
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this edifice.
Even if it's only for decoration."
This is how MVRDV reached the master discipline that is called, in professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse wrote a new page in literary history.
Even if she may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a bigger role."
Germany chose to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinians' request for observer state status at the United Nations.
But then she chose abstention.
What for?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, as it has a special relationship with Israel.
But I also think that she does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also chose to abstain in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Eventually, NATO imposed this measure.
Is Germany having difficulty in adopting a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy that is so to speak defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans therefore came up against several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe they are still groping to find this role, but are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Great Britain
What, then, does the term "normal" foreign policy mean to the Germans in concrete terms?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including on national issues.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, and therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of the other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests influence Germany's position on the Middle East conflict and abstention in the UN vote?
Germany first has important outlets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to offend public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a determining factor.
However, I would not attach too much importance to it, because it is not an exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is in any case a decisive element in German strategic thinking.
Is Germany harming its relations with the United States by choosing to abstain in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think the Europeans and the Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think that the divide is not as serious as it was in the case of the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will be all the more respected.
Indeed, Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions about the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States announced its veto in a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the domestic political scene in the United States.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly showing great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing with enthusiasm for Netanyahu's policies.
Is Germany having any difficulty in reconciling its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think it makes things any easier for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but today this is not the case.
They cannot therefore be part of a broader political line and must assert their singular position.
That is what they are doing now on the euro issue.
In my opinion, Germany will in future assume the role of locomotive and push Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, not least because of its relations with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they have to play a role that marks their independence more.
Does Germany see itself playing a major role on the international stage, does Germany just want to play a key role?
Or does it still struggle to take on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a more important role.
If we look, for example, at the euro crisis, we notice that every time Germany decides to carry more weight, many anti-German sentiments are heard.
It doesn't make things any easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
She has to deal with a wide variety of neighbours and opinions, and it's not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European politics is only diminishing, but at the moment the EU is not filling this void, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant to them and if they're even less appreciated, that's life!
Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, D.C., an institute in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America work together to analyze the challenges facing the transatlantic community.
Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specialized in German politics, U.S. foreign policy, and transatlantic relations.
"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... What is it really about?
Behind this name hides a trademark officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection that the undertaking bearing its name cannot lodge a complaint.
And even if she could, he is not sure she would win her case.
"It's becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing who specializes in property infringement in the Far East.
Every week, a new folder arrives on my desk.
Imitators only need a few more letters to be able to register their trademarks.
So instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci is recorded, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is recorded.
German companies are also being copied legally, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sporting goods.
Pattloch opens a binder containing the registrations made with the Beijing trademark office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trademark, a name that the firm artificially created by appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and intellectual property infringement.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that sell practically only counterfeits.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different: his principals charge him with attacking the fact that the Chinese trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women who marry rich men are designated.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to reproach themselves with.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch said.
"The brand is watered down, the singularity disappears, the damage to the reputation is enormous."
Financial losses and legal costs amount to millions for the sectors concerned, especially for expensive flagship products.
According to data from market analysis firm CLSA, China is the world's third fastest growing luxury goods market with an annual volume of €15 billion.
However, it is not easy to remove dubious registrations from the trademark registry and these procedures are expensive.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch refers to the lawsuits in which the court dismissed the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name criticized had become a "reality of the market".
Pattloch explains that if the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist because he would have damaged his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against construction machine manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought concrete pump producer Putzmeister.
This is the reason why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's owner, used to use a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW. The dispute was settled and Geely had to change it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost to plagiarists in Hong Kong and Singapore who had redirected the famous crocodile's gaze in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing, however, admits to having experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the office reportedly went from an "emergency situation in the workflow to a restored normality" last year.
Thus, the number of opposition proceedings not dealt with would have decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have reportedly been closed, representing a 75% increase over the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 proceedings remain pending at the office.
Taking action is expensive
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, this is a record and means that China is at the top of the ranking for the number of new filings worldwide for the tenth time in a row.
This would also apply to the total number of legal trademarks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office reportedly recorded 1.8 billion yuan in registration fees.
In other words, each registration brought in an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
Admittedly, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of vehicle components suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
"It's our fault, because surnames cannot be protected in Germany," says Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademark office had therefore rejected the objection of the Munich.
Freudenberg won his case in the next two instances, but the opposing party continues to fight until today.
Vigilance is required
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praises the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: "The procedure is long, strenuous and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The archives even had to review the acts of the last hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even offered the opposing party a "large six-figure sum in euros" to settle the dispute.
"That's what it means to us," Wentzler said.
The dangers of the Far East threaten even to spill over into Europe.
This would be the case if imitators in this region ensured the exploitation of unprotected marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to register Freudenberg's name in Germany for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it had still been able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "Vigilance is required."
He and Pattloch advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, they say, to rely on international trademark law, but rather "register in China everything that is likely to be protected," as Wentzler puts it.
Otherwise, the costs can be much higher than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay license fees to the opposing party for the use of his own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or we would lose our place in the segment of the market in question.
World AIDS Day: tapping, singing, helping
The Imbongi choir is rehearsing in Heidelberg, and AIDS orphans in Swaziland are looking forward to their visit.
This is the story of a link that spans much more than a distance of 8.733 kilometers.
First, we tap our feet: cowboy boots, sneakers, pumps for ladies and loafers for men seek rhythm by hitting the ground with their feet. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the singers are slowly amplified - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they are carried away, bewitched and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses his canvas shoes when he conducts the orchestra with his wildly flexible gestures.
It's Monday night, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Fifty singers from 23 to 69 years old came, from the geneticist in human medicine to the housewife.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each singer has different lyrics, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Be helped to help yourself
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are living with the disease.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected people.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a sponsor.
This sum guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "storyteller" or "singer of praise".
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the choir has been rehearsing songs in this foreign language that it brought to Germany and now returns it to its native region: Southern Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest huts of straw or earth and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans because HIV has taken their parents.
In Esitjeni, Swaziland's ills can be seen on a smaller scale: the highest HIV infection rate and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population carries the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in their mid-thirties.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village. The Imbongis especially saw many children on the street who lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
In the beginning, it was just a few people who personally pledged to contribute a few euros each year so that they could send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But barely a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has been caring for AIDS orphans in Esitjeni in an almost professional way ever since.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies belong to parasitic STIs.
Which groups are primarily concerned?
Syphilis and gonorrhoea often appear in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men is responsible for at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of HIV spread among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections than among other population groups.
According to European records, three-quarters of all infections are among young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, in Germany, the human papillomavirus is common in young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases has more than doubled in 10 years: from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has been declining.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one-tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual disease?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white discharge, pain in the lower abdomen and the appearance of pimples and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms may decrease the risk of infection, but they do not provide 100% protection.
This is because pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through lubricating infection or close bodily contact.
Experts therefore recommend that anyone who often changes sexual partners take regular exams.
Most STIs detected quickly can be cured and late sequelae can be prevented.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all to the funds raised by the choristers thanks to their voices throughout Germany, the means accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
She also ensures that orphans are well housed, with one of their grandmothers for example.
The gogos, as the old women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them take in up to 14 orphans, provide them with shelter and ensure that they arrive at school on time in their uniforms every day.
The orphan who has no one left is welcomed in a safe place, at Khanyisile's house, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" established a sewing school and enabled the construction of two chicken coops. With the help of the American health organization PSI, the association organized an HIV test for many residents.
This is not self-evident, because even if the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"AIDS is a real taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's a subject that touches on sexuality."
It's quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These and other state-sanctioned mores are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
Condoms can be found on every street corner, Lennartz adds, "but hardly anyone uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the choristers of Imbongi go on a trip together every two or three years in the South of Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many inhabitants of the tip of the black continent still know during the apartheid era.
The bus full of white people singing in the African language is such a sign of recognition that it not only generates good humor and joy, but sometimes also tears a tear from some fearsome border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the choristers visit their godchildren.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there," say the people there.
And after a journey of 8.733 kilometers as the crow flies, back in Heidelberg, in front of these choristers tapping their feet in the rehearsal room of Bergheimer Straße, we also find the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 metres thick.
The American space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of ice cover in the region of the planet permanently plunged into shadow.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters up to 20 meters.
The water probably comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that have collided with Mercury.
However, no one makes a connection between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a presence of life on the planet, says the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help understand how water and other life-sustaining elements arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, like small interstices through which we observe the infinite.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet," according to the International Astronomical Union's 2006 new definition of the term.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "newborns" in the delivery room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where stars are born, called "W5", a very unromantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the blazing glare of a dying star.
The donut-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust are forming new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades, star clusters also called "the seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope emphasizes colors more.
In this infrared photo, the Helix Nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to a terrestrial continent has earned it the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo makes it possible to observe a spectacular hue.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigmas in astronomy concerns the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs the Hubble telescope has taken is of the Whirlpool Galaxy.
Depending on the hue, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifidus comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three streaks of dust divide the shiny heart of the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic pile-up in the constellation Serpentarius: 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies rush towards each other, collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "Southern Wheel of Fire".
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula lies 1,400 light-years away and is composed of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than common house dust.
This photo was developed from optical and radiographic images taken by different telescopes.
You can see the circle composed of black holes that is 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The celestial cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are connected by the Rosetta Nebula, also permanently create young stars 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists believe it was born shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope at Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror in this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It makes it possible to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Canary Islands, is huge. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to save money.
The diameter still reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the economical construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the level of the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its particularity lies in its high light collection capacity.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is close to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists are listening to the universe for extraterrestrial signals using the radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help with "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) by using the computing power of their machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, a facility worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The construction of a European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for ESO's Chile site.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will consist of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They sported two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory that observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the FTIR.
A gigantic new telescope is also expected to be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been giving us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for exoplanets, mainly habitable ones.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the beginning of the mission.
This photo illustrates the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space in 2018 at the earliest aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope's mission will include finding light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe that Mercury's south pole is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to Mercury's North Pole.
Radar data had indicated the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now know for sure.
Drink butter daily, and live to 168
In southern Azerbaijan, many people are reaching ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country in which people are still relatively young at 97.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people are reaching ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country in which people are still relatively young at 97.
The journey to the Talysh Mountains is a dishevelled romanticism.
At the bend of the many turns of the road, the small bus bumps along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, it almost feels like the Black Forest.
But here we are in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group called Talysh lives, about whom little is known, except that they speak Persian and Azeri perfectly and have a very long life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town plasters with its overly aggressive Soviet-era architecture that doesn't fit at all with the picturesque mountain scenery.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, as the road has only one lane.
The province has yet to benefit from the legendary wealth the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist spot.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world here," Fatulayeva said.
She is director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
You can discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh of the region who are more than 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he has reached the age of 120.
Still having a child at 136
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who is said to have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when you consider that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," Fatulayeva said.
The man is said to have married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he is said to have conceived a girl again.
Would Şirali Müslümov have been wrong by a few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard him talk about man in old age in Central Asia.
"Surprisingly elderly people also live in parts of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz explains, "in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific proof because of the non-existence of documents, not to mention that there was no civil registry.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
It is nevertheless a fact that the people of the Lerik region often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tour guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it is a question of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the high-calorie meals of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves people's youth? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a churn, the contents of which she beats tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two small children also frolic in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical belly shaped armadus glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf are hidden long braids of a dark blond that her son reveals with pride.
I always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost it and it kept its color.
"I've never used shampoo," Mirzayeva adds.
Monthly retirement is enough to live on
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In all my life, I have never bought a single food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The language of propaganda astonishes in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the father figure of the nation, a man who ruled his country like a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, after which was succeeded by his son Ilham.
In any case, the elderly of Azerbaijan do not experience distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats a month (about the same amount as in euros) for her pension, a sum that guarantees a good lifestyle in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-graying son is right: "elders enjoy great respect in our culture."
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That's a good reason to live as long as possible.
"Human rights" omitted from the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Rival protests reveal the deep fracture of the country.
The draft constitution based on Sharia law is violently controversial.
The Egyptian president is not stingy with emotional words.
We need to make a successful transition.
"And this achievement is my responsibility to the people and to God," he told state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but also especially to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened and secular Muslims.
Because all the members of the confused and desperately disunited opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologetically, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its own "in order to save the revolution".
However, Egyptians and the world don't really know what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the University of Southern California, wants to salvage.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles hastily drafted by the mostly Islamic constituent assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour night tour de force are indeed disturbing to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
This was and still is a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists will use the vague wording and the resulting legal leeway to apply a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
In any case, this is what is suggested by a newly introduced article stipulating that, with regard to all matters relating to Sharia, al-Azhar University must be consulted. The establishment is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its brilliance radiates throughout the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean, that the clergy will monitor the legislative apparatus, which would de facto result in the trusteeship of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are open to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely continuation of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's rule, these courts worked to suppress opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The draft must also protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values."
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, it would simply be censorship.
Moreover, there is no article expressly guaranteeing equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
However, the article does not define what an offence is or how it is to be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording implying that it is forbidden to "offend people".
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or to tell a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Many points are therefore open to interpretation in the draft that Morsi is putting to the vote and which, in his own words, will "very soon" be the subject of a referendum among Egyptians.
"The revolution is reborn"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of the Islamists.
On Friday night, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual concord in Cairo's Tahrir Square, vowing to scrap Sharia law before it goes into effect.
"The revolution is reborn and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei said the draft constitution is "to be thrown into the dustbin of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to foment a "coup against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned for," Khaled Ali, a politician and opposition member, told Egyptian media.
In addition, several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its nullity.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-demonstration not in Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a large prayer was organized in front of Cairo University.
Veiled women and supporters of Salafists, who participated in large numbers, chanted: "The people demand the application of God's law."
"Clean up our country!" they asked Morsi, claiming that "the Koran [was their] constitution."
A fight for sovereignty over the symbolic Tharir Square, where it all began, would soon have created a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, this is what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said opponents of the draft constitution, as well as its supporters, had spoken out loud and clear.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide through the ballot box the direction the country should take.
The Islamists' project will certainly win a majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process that should have lasted until February and encompassed all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when it was in prison or in court under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their worldview, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That is why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now the term is not even pronounced once in the new constitution," he said in his interview with Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to all three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant attacks on the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president is de facto stripping it of all its powers," Saeda said.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between different political ideologies on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
It could be paid for.
A protester in Tharir Square warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
The rakfisk of Norway: is it the most fragrant fish in the world?
Norway's five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be related to the locals' appetite for an extremely fragrant fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty soccer clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most popular delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It's snowing, the scenery is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, permeates the air.
Rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for a period of time - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can be up to a year.
When darkness sets in and it's cold, Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival here in Fagernes dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you have a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter also known as "Rakfisk General," who is responsible for running the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and put on a large amount of drink.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," Havard adds.
The drink kills the smell.
I try a few pieces.
If you can avoid running it under your nose, it's not bad – it's reminiscent of a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
Rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, fish was immersed in airtight barrels of water and then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish is taken out and - undoubtedly with the senses diminished by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, emigrating mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered something important, a vital, albeit fragrant, element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you €10 each.
Norway is not often talked about in international news, which is not to displease him.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who shot dead 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they speak of the "July 22 incident".
The Norwegians find it difficult to accept that in their peaceful country, one of their own could have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 70s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our success," says Anna, our waitress, with blonde hair and piercing blue eyes, the image of Nordic well-being, with a tray of rakfisk in hand.
We are - how do you say - prudent people.
His English, like that of most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth very carefully - everything except a small percentage of money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries were throwing money out the window in the years leading up to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep its purse strings tight.
"As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"Not to mention rakfisk," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I stand in the snow and queue to buy food - I've had my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger composed of momentum, a real discovery, it's excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I'm staying at is one of the many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them – or perhaps the smelliest of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a bow tie, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score did you give to the best fish, in the Thor-Juergen mountains?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of aquavit abuse.
Or maybe it's because of fish fumes.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto had a rough start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, the BBC's Will Grant looks ahead and the expectations of the people, of which there are many.
Road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal times, a security roadblock has been in place since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the aim was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico's economy is doing well, thanks to incumbent President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
"My government is committed to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Prior to meeting the U.S. President, Mr. Pena Nieto was Governor of the State of Mexico.
A very populous and sprawling state that encloses the capital. In his favorite land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The locals attribute to him the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new highways of M Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made to these roads, once bumpy and full of crevasses.
Plaques bearing his name hang outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to bring about lasting change," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a congressman and Pena Nieto's PRI party.
In terms of security and economy in particular, we hope for a real change that our country so badly needs.
After 81 flawless years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects criticism from opponents who accuse the new president of lacking charisma.
He is a whole man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image that people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more glaring.
Hidden under highway overpasses, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called to the rescue to combat drug gangs in neighbourhoods, and violence against women is particularly acute.
In a disaster area, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the past two years were found on the edge of the landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a rate far higher than in the violent city of Ciudad Juarez — a place infamous for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
Critics of Mr. Pena Nieto say that, at best, he failed to stem the problem of murders of women while in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this run-down neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears as she shows me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version mentions a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family believes she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says Señora Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and cadaveric rigidity had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana adorns the wall, next to a cross with the word: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old gossip, a troublemaker, a whiner.
They want us to accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it's not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, it will come with a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years, and the new president has promised that he will make it his priority during his term.
"I hope he will be as good as president as he was when he was governor," Olvera said in Congresswoman Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of mistreatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counter allegations of abuse against Manning during detention.
The trial involves Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to dismiss the case on the grounds that Manning's confinement took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried Friday to demonstrate that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of being behind the biggest leak of confidential information in U.S. military history -- missed numerous opportunities to complain about the mistreatment he claims he suffered while in military custody.
During cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein claimed that recordings of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months in detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a motion demanding that the Manning case be dismissed on the grounds that the forcible confinement took place under very difficult conditions and was a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place a day after Manning testified that he wanted to commit suicide while in custody.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were later published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms the officers had filled out after their meeting with Manning, while he was held in Quantico military prison, where he was subjected to maximum solitary confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein brought up the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment he received from his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had received within the prison overall was "very professional."
The forms do not show any complaints of ill-treatment, although officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning responded that he had verbally expressed concerns about certain issues and that visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would address them, but they did not record the issues raised.
"They wrote 'no problem' (after addressing the concerns), and that didn't mean I hadn't raised any issues," Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment during a January 2011 interview with the special commission that met to discuss suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during the meeting was to have his restrictive status changed indicating a "risk of injury."
The military said they assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know I was fine, and I wanted to be stripped of that status... in order to have a better quality of life from my perspective," Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He stated that he considered committing suicide while in Kuwait and fainted once because of the heat.
He added that not being kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had were a mattress, blanket, flip-flops, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay moving, as sleeping or lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning also said that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he turned around at night, they woke him up so they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked overnight in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates one morning during the call.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with a blanket during the call.
During the judge's questions Friday, Manning said he deduced from his guard's order that he had to drop his blanket that could have hidden his nudity, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to let go of it.
Manning testified Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the night before because he allegedly tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underpants or flip-flops to injure himself, but that he did not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops, and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account his experiences while in detention and significantly reduce his sentence if he were to be convicted by court martial, a trial expected to take place early next year.
The defense said Manning plans to plead guilty to the lesser offenses and fight for the dropping of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was incarcerated in accordance with the regulations that govern the conditions of detention of all detainees at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to national defense.
If all charges are upheld, he faces life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says many have been forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says the Mexican-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby in front of customs and immigration, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two routes: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood still for several seconds, not knowing which line to head to.
I grew up in central California, where I've been called the "Mexican" all my life.
It's an ethnic adjective, just like the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves "Irish," or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italian."
Then I became "Mexican-American".
But, here, it was Mexico.
And, on the land where my grandfather was born, there is no need for a special qualifier or hyphen.
I was simply an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle an interview in either language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and headed to the "Foreigners" line.
I thought about that time of the week when Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, visited President Obama in the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risk the United States.
He wants to ally himself with the United States and Canada, and create a Union for trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto pledges to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, though he did not provide further details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half of their territory in writing at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how the Americans are infringing on the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And Montezuma's children are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans who live in the United States.
Do you want us to talk about bitterness?
There are a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, did not find any opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than not, that person fit a typical profile -- dark, poorly educated, poor village skin, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we are currently living the American dream, we have gone to good schools and we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that this is the American dream we are living, not the Mexicans' dream.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We give it to the United States.
On the other hand, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they toast us as if we were individuals of inferior and not sufficiently Mexican stock.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we wouldn't find ourselves stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally emigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because Mexicans claim their identity more firmly and Mexican-Americans are upset about it.
Although she is a U.S. citizen, she feels part of two countries.
On the other hand, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel like they're part of one country or the other.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our fellow Americans that Mexico is a beautiful country that must be visited and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes of course.
That will not happen.
There is too much bitterness.
And, considering the pervasive wage inequality, corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're going to have to fend for yourself, amigos.
This is normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way it treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans still resent them for the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we are more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Can there never be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is vain.
While the same futile arguments persist as to who started it, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring shattered everything, and like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little more.
Still, there's every reason to think it could help them out of this deadly impasse.
A war that has no losers or winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 continues, this week's fighting has strengthened supporters of the force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will boast of having forced the Israelis to give up, even though Gaza has been beaten.
Having killed some of its leaders and driven Gaza's 1.7 million inhabitants back into one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals Fatah, the other, more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders might say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a burgeoning regional power, once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members are jubilant and say the Islamist crescent is bending around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where Hezbollah's militia dominates, to Syria, where Islamist-leaning rebels can topple Bashar al-Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
And most importantly, on Israel's southern flank, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time for Hamas.
In contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas, and its leaders more easily defer to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important player that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, Israel's hardliners will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been boxed.
The missile interception system called Iron Dome proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
Israelis will be able to sleep soundly – for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries blamed Hamas for the latest wave of violence.
But above all, Israel has prospered, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who has totally ignored the peace process.
Although rocket fire from Gaza has killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared suicide bombings, thanks in part to the separation barrier that encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality under international law.
Netanyahu, whose Likud party has merged with an even more hawkish party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the Jan. 22 election, has the upper hand.
Why coddle these damn Palestinians by giving them a state?
If they ruled the West Bank, wouldn't they launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they stick their heads out.
Perhaps the hardliners will prevail; But the Arab Spring may change that.
Even if Islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere dislike Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments fix their economies.
Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to secure a ceasefire, which bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, stripping Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is bound to explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories — much like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are exacerbating this problem as the Arab population grows.
Bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to sound Hamas will have a diplomatic price.
Both sides need to be pushed by those on the outside.
The answer remains the one advocated by the reasonable people on both sides, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a cession of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will provide an opportunity for outsiders to champion this cause.
Egypt, which must now focus on ending the flow of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute far more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal for a pseudo-state at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has a vested interest in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It is a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Plain cigarette packaging laws have come into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of diseased organs cover the dark green packets that are all the same, regardless of the brand
This law that came into force in Australia is a world first, the logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrific photos of diseased organs and depictions of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small print on all the packages.
It is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government has said the aim is to deter young people from smoking by removing any glamorous portrayal.
Studies have shown that if people didn't start smoking until the age of 26, there's a 99% chance they'll never start.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco companies through their branding," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that found, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with a princess.
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry lobbied against this law.
Tobacco companies said this would revive the black market trade, which will give easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
"There will be adverse consequences from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell many more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said the law had boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned business, said demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to hide horrific packaging, has risen sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in Australia's High Court.
Ha said Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is waiting to renew its stock.
For us, business is good.
The only problem, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the segment of population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising, sports sponsorship and requiring retailers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned web advertising by local companies and sites, but it cannot stop foreign sites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and you only have a small storefront to promote your products, the internet is the place to be," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman has noticed an increase in contributions from some ordinary citizens to brands on social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves, is this a private citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and has gone to the trouble of making a video, or is it a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focusing on the new regulations in place rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court rulings – these countries have told the WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in the course of 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries regarding similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to mandate photo warnings on packaging in 2001.
At present, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are currently under consideration in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain unmoved by these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I do not know them.
"You take a cigarette and put the package away," El Hage said as he bought a pack with a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I will stop is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack tobacconist in central Sydney, said the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to store packages on shelves.
"Before, it took me an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government just had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it's okay, we stop and we close down," he added, raising his arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to be bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I had enough time to think about the theme of boredom.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is pretty boring, even when you have books, magazines, and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and experts specializing in child development are praising boredom.
It's perfectly normal for us — and our children — to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, even to nurture creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
But I will come back to that.
First of all, like many people, I thought that boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But that's not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The boredom goes back a long way," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After going through numerous publications and submitting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience of "wanting to do something, but failing to engage in a satisfying activity."
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task although they would like to.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do something.
What is at the heart of boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, coupled with a sullen mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Boredom can strongly resemble depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while the two can be linked, bored people tend to think the problem is with the environment or the world, while depressed people think the problem is with them.
Sometimes we think that we are bored when it is actually a problem of concentration.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experiment in which participants listened on cassette to the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard the loud sound of an unrelated TV show from the next room, others just heard the TV show, and the third group didn't hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low noise level said they were more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but didn't know why, and attributed this concentration problem to boredom.
When you're trying to focus on a difficult or time-consuming task, an interruption in attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study's authors.
On the other hand, when you're performing a boring task, "like looking at objects on an assembly line, music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he says, now we know that when we squirm or doodle, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to fiddle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stand still," Professor Fenske said.
We all get bored at one time or another - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monotone voice, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more likely to be bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Boredom Predisposition Scale" in the 80s.
The scale includes statements like, "Many of the tasks I perform are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida, and in particular need many and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly jaded.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teens and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
It found that 32 percent of teens reported being bored at school and during homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't at school.
In contrast, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he didn't know if today's boredom percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knows that "adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest level," especially because children and teens don't have much control over what they want to do.
If I ask my question again: Is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
In contrast, many philosophers and writers talk about a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the way the brain has found to let you know you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at the N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn't always know what the most appropriate thing to do is.
If you're bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give them an iPad, they won't be bored anymore, but they won't have learned to take care of themselves or self-adjust, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation passes from one situation to another," he says.
Your child doesn't just learn to be entertained, they get more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside of the constant bubbling that activities and technology generate is the goal we should strive for.
Professor Eastwood agrees with this.
"We need to be bored more often, but boredom awakens an acute, frenetic desire to be connected to something meaningful," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy downtime.
"In an environment where we're constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it's hard to find ways to jump into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no guidelines for new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student and soccer player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana pellets and a pipe used to smoke them.
Orozco said one day in September, he and a few friends were in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the Kansas border, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for his use — minor offenses, each with a $100 fine — and a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," Orozco said.
But is it one?
In the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado's vote to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on location than on law.
Here and in Washington state, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving marijuana use have been dismissed.
Police have stopped charging adults 21 and older with minor possession of marijuana because the law will come into effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative districts have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to charge those who possess them.
Meanwhile, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-licensed marijuana businesses in their neighborhoods.
"Things are moving so fast that I don't know what the future holds," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Washington state regulators are also asking quite a few questions.
They are seeking guidance on how to install a licensing system, authorizing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the December 1, 2013 deadline.
They say Colorado, like it or not, is ahead of most states when it comes to marijuana regulation, first on therapeutic use and now on personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Smith acknowledges, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could build," he said.
Washington's law, called I-502, takes effect on Dec. 6, leaving a year-long loophole in which the licensing system will still not exist, while marijuana possession will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical questions remain unanswered: how to balance the state's mandate that guarantees appropriate access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the establishment of cannabis businesses within a 30km radius of a school, park, playground or nursery.
"There won't be more challenging places than urban areas to set up a licensed cannabis business, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Cannabis Legalization, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Police Chief Oates in Aurora sent an email to his officers announcing that the City Attorney would no longer prosecute people aged 21 and over who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that police should stop charging people with this type of offense "with immediate effect."
Chief Oates said police will enforce new court rulings that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and he will continue to prosecute drug dealers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, district attorney Ken Buck embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to handle marijuana possession cases, primarily to pressure users to get detoxed.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many are facing other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute these individuals who have committed an offence that, at the material time, was a recognized offence," Buck said.
Reactions were complicated even in rural places like Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative in favor of restricted marijuana use.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer bring adults in court for possession of limited amounts.
County Attorney General Pete Hautzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to dismiss all marijuana detention cases.
"I don't feel like I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
While 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and governmental framework for personal marijuana use is no easy task.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different U.S. cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding marijuana legalization.
"It's a cultural barrier" with prosecutors, said Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney who represents those accused of marijuana use and speaks as a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They've spent a good part of their lives prosecuting people who were using marijuana, so they have a hard time accepting that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana use at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and Washington state are poised to become a case law for drug legalization.
While advocates and state officials are planning a new frontier of legalized sales, they are anxiously awaiting guidelines from the federal government, which still views the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of marijuana legalization hope the Justice Department will give in.
Despite some high-profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and vendors, the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana businesses to operate in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it's true that police probably aren't going to break down doors to seize small packets of drugs, it's a safe bet they're opposing licensed businesses selling marijuana for personal use that are allowed under the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Many Colorado cities didn't wait for federal authorities to act.
Long before the votes, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana businesses, even if it is only a one-year delay.
Last week, the town of Montrose obtained a 6-month moratorium, and is expected to impose this ban next week.
"We don't want to end up in a situation where someone is licensed and then end up with a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the community vote rather than the state vote.
There are a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied and expelled from Oxford because I was a Tory.
It's not just today's students who are being attacked for their opinions.
For as long as I can remember, I have always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was for me an eminent place of learning, a kind of modern-day Greek amphitheater that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after moving to Worcester College in the late 80s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and started crying.
My friends were baffled.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had left that university because I had objected to the fact that undergraduates were having sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson facetiously stated that I left after being forced to drink from chipped cups.
The truth was less funny.
I fled.
Yes, I fled because I had been bullied and bullied.
Not because of my rather outrageous name, nor because of the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason and one reason only, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behaviour: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why bring this up today, you might ask.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of center-right students are experiencing the same kind of persecution.
The growing and institutionalised hatred of Tory students at Oxford is such that last week some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's Student Hall (JCR) said they were "often isolated, personally attacked and feel unwanted" because of their political views.
They want there to be a representative on the university's Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation has not been helped by the recent BBC Two documentary "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", devoted to student politics, which portrayed the "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
We discovered in particular the student Joe Cooke, former president of the "Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA)", who travels in a Rolls-Royce, wears a silver suit and travels with a rod with chrome head.
At other universities, conservative students say they are being scapegoated for implementing tuition increases."
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper "there is a growing left-wing bias in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says such a climate is "uncomfortable," and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OUCA, says there has been a deterioration in JCR members' attitude toward people who are center-right.
"This is a hindrance to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one to think this way during my first few weeks at Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, I was then 18 years old and paralyzingly shy.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was very virulent.
The year before, the university had voted to refuse to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was charged with Stalinist vibes.
From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students got to know each other and the teachers, I got a taste of what would happen next.
I discovered that the professors not only participated in the sarcasm towards Tory students, but also enjoyed it.
It was as if the politics of striking miners, privatization and the government's opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa were etched into the wood of classrooms.
The first sarcasm I experienced involved a translation into English of 18th century French texts, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I lost my footing.
Pitt, a small man with a pustular face, was easily carried away.
"Do Thatcherites refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
Tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French lessons in your spare time – well, if you're not too busy making friends," he said angrily.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and then felt a slight pat on my shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said, gently.
I am afraid that is so.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's hard enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be even harder for you.
Most young Torys claim to be Labour.
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher had said.
This ploy failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political science and economics who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You are contaminated.
Other students picked up the chorus.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do the Tories make love?" one of them asked.
They hit each other, don't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
Could I have even led a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I have become Labour and renounced my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a Conservative, but also because he was Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of her speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents' home in London, finding refuge with my more open-minded city family and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He was incredulous.
During his studies at Oxford in the forties, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he told me pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreamy bell towers.
Even my communist friends had impeccable manners.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional stamina gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial session the following week, when another history teacher suggested most seriously that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Blushing inwardly with shame, I admitted to being brainwashed by my parents and called them "old fools."
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who drove the last nail in my Oxford coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press each week.
My door was locked.
I stayed lurking in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me a whiny wet hen.
But no 18-year-old should be bullied in a school.
Most tragically, it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also has an unwavering reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: A Master of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian couturier.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier recognized this at the inauguration of "Valentino: A Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for his fashion house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous customers.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, there is an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exhibits his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascent: from the modest couturier of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There is nothing wrong with loving royalty.
"At least they don't crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet like some pop stars do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad," says the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, a close friend of past beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And even so, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charisma of the couturier.
Several years ago, after a parade in the Spanish Steps in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
You could see and feel his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in the decoration, the food, the music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the Haute Couture week in Paris in 1995.
"He will never go out of fashion, because his creations are works of art," she concludes.
Parade of lineage of nobility
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He likes well-behaved people and with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous sixty-metre wide catwalk that offers to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade on the catwalk to admire a dream "audience" wearing Valentino's main creations, such as the suit chosen by Jackie Kennedy for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis,  the costume worn by Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
Among this audience of models, we find names like Sybille from Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sophie from Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of her customers say that Valentino's first clothes are like first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember that perfectly.
These were trousers, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It's a gift he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the couturier's muses.
"I prefer him to all others for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimates our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses, they are bright and illuminate the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashionista Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she wore a Valentino model either.
When she was a teenager living in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, this was possible in the late 90s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red evening dress, with a ruffled skirt, a draped bustier and a neckline to die for.
"It was a dream come true," said Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless," says the Italian aristocrat who divides his time between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg keeps the couturier's evening dresses with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories it conveys".
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the couturier calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory silk dress with pearl inlays, twelve different kinds of lace and a train of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of haute couture at the end of the twentieth century, "the return of the customers of high society".
Obsessed for years by the "know-how" of the nobility, Valentino is now its best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any husband of his clients.
"His refinement, his calmness, his neat and perfect appearance have always jumped out at me," admits d'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was seated at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says it...
The hardest job in the world: Kawah Ijen's human mules
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by carrying sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gas emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies on contact with the air.
After collecting large sulfur rocks, which weigh a total of nearly 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep paths.
There are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano which rises to 2,386 meters above sea level, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a turtle pace, keeping balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall into the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilo of sulfur extracted.
Once at the top, they make their way between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus beasts, and painfully carrying the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers to the scale that a mining company has installed a little below at 1,850 meters above sea level.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) per kilo of sulfur.
She then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry since this mineral is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and is even used to bleach sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," says Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each one takes him 3 hours and he finishes exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems like a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is triple what he would earn in the fields.
"The income of miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros)," says the porter who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) a day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindus,  and I took her back to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases.
At 27, he has spent three of his life defying danger on the Kawah ljen, but sulfur has already started to make him foot the bill despite covering his face with a mask and wearing special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I will work for another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Battered by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead, he does the work of a mule.
He shares an unsanitary wooden mansion with other porters, gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulfur does not stop gushing at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glows in the middle of darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater lighting himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 porters load the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur mining to save costs and does not provide any equipment to self-employed porters who are paid by weight.
In addition, they also do not receive a penny of the 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) surcharge per camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans," protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old corpulent porter who has worked at Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left college.
Able to carry up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... To which are obviously added their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, the 53-year-old Unainik can only load 50 kilos.
Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat trail overgrown with weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik said, opening his mouth tightly, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult jobs in the world: that of the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame this lack of children on the career, stress and cost of homeownership.
"Singapore's population needs to grow."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem implausible that these words come from an advertisement for mint lozenges, but despite this, or perhaps thanks to it, the video spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's go put a polichinelle in the drawer" to poke fun at Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the issue in a fun way through this ad.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to get people fulfilling "their national duty."
It's only for the internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in terms of birth rates, so we felt it was a topic we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing pheromone flavors or organizing speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative but they didn't necessarily work.
So we thought: what could be more creative to solve this problem than to make it a rap song?
1.2 children
The Singapore government does not take it so lightly.
It spends US$1,300 a year on policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favor of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this had little effect.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its rulers' conservatism and strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, in line with its national population distribution, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered the renewal rate, was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policies of the National Population Division, says this is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities."
"This has given people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and forming a family," she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of single people and delays in marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in Singapore's birth rate.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to counter the decline in population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound with thinly disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially the Chinese who are accused of dragging down wages and not integrating.
Increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore's ruling party had its worst election results since independence last year.
Since the election, they have tried to correct the problem with the implementation of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unintended consequences
While falling birth rates have known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also has unintended consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, it started to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoeboxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they may promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of real estate company EL Developers, says his "shoeboxes" sell much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular, in the sense that these homes are built much faster than larger ones.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to developers, who were previously put in the works if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations could be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the center, it would seem that they will not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive, and so is education, that's why people put it off," says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But for me, it's important to have my money and time," says another twenty-something.
Both men and women cite their careers, the stress and cost of home ownership and education as reasons preventing them from having children.
So while the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans themselves have the final say.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of privacy that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is private for children under 16?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposing himself to by broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15, who are frequent users of the web.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very personal" on a personal level with "password and username" when applying it to social networks.
"I won't reveal my most personal secrets in a post," says ten-year-old Jorge as he tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them but not everyone," he said.
On FB, I post cool pictures or games.
I also chat with my friends.
"I won't share one of my photos or someone who would be a fool," he says.
The young boy acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photos, nude people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine followers on Twitter.
The majority are family.
Her mother is one of them, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he adds.
"Social media is fun, I can talk with distant relatives or friends, fast," he says.
He says he would never accept an unknown person's request.
Nor will he trust someone who would recommend a stranger to him.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not knowing 20 of the people on his friends list.
"It doesn't worry me because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the young boy, no one made advances to him or asked for his address or phone number.
"If they pressured me or demanded it, I would just remove them from my account," he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today as cyberbullying are not foreign to the young boy.
A relative of one of my friends was racketed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he said.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He only passed it in private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account in a safe way.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or upset.
"Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he said.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, considers that, to guide children and adolescents, we must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way to search for information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras points out that academician Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book "Digital Natives and Immigrants," uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are they, children and young people who are born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we ourselves are learning," she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what should or should not be disclosed, published or said at an age when they do not have the maturity to do so".
"We also ask them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach privacy to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
"There's no point in telling them not to," she said.
Then Porras lists some examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a picture of you like a friend you posted?
Do you know what others post about you?
When you tag photos of parties, do you ask other people for permission to tag them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
"Outside the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks," she said.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university teacher, primary school teacher and education adviser, says it is essential for parents to read the terms of use of social media conscientiously.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children not to talk to strangers.
The Unasur summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration having been made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 representatives present.
Efe tried several times to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Unasur Heads of State and Government, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially signalled that it would be released after the summit closed, then claimed that it would be published any moment on the Peruvian government's website.
When asked about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit has been consistently limited.
During the day, only the video without sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
What little information circulated among the journalists was that given by the press officers of some of the Unasur governments who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document leaked during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who were demanding more important information.
Later, the presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was President Humala's speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd South America-Arab Countries Summit (ASPA) and, on that occasion, although it was urged by the press, it had not issued the declaration also known as the Lima Declaration, as had previously been announced.
On the official website of the ASPA, we can verify that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to set up safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited the access to information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court that settles a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the arguments of both sides in the lawsuit Lima has filed against Santiago that begins Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes we are bringing today before this international court," Humala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of controversies, treaties and international tribunals," President Piñera added, shaking hands with President Humala, next to the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia this week denounced the Pact of Bogotá by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of this international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered gravely erroneous.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host President, Ollanta Humala, was tasked with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The trustee read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been set between South American countries for a total of $17 million of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the Unasur countries would put in place "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions for better access to medicines, access to low-cost Internet throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to glimpse a better future for our populations," concluded President Humala.
"We decided to focus on a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," the Peruvian president said in a speech.
Of these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were located on the cross-cutting axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give further details.
Similarly, the outcome document refers to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process of this country will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and with good relations with its neighbours, is another theme discussed at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through an ICJ judgment requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I will have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will review all these paths, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua which will require a discussion with this country," he said.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will settle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City where they are scheduled to witness the takeover of that country's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, as part of the summit, the bloc's defense ministers will meet beforehand to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defense in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the presidency pro tempore of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal for which "South America, in this case, must follow Europe's example."
President Correa, who participated in the VI summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, told state television, TV Peru, that Europeans "killed each other in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are almost a homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make a thing of the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President has shown himself in favor of the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who beat our ears never compromise anything, conversely, we South Americans have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding," he said, referring to Ecuador's political asylum for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself did not betray his principles, but on the contrary he respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected."
In addition, he criticises the Swedish judiciary for requiring him to submit to an interrogation on its territory concerning an alleged sexual offence whereas "Sweden's own legislation allows this to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa claimed there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health could deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he has a small lung problem, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian president said.
Their physical and mental health may deteriorate by being locked in a small space without being able to exercise in the open.
"It affects anyone's health," he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the granting of a safe conduct that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities and he points out that he has had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder.
We are not negotiating with human rights, we are not using that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of proceedings before different European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain granted safe conduct tomorrow, it would end".
And if Sweden, as its legislation fully allows, and as it has already done in other cases, were to question Mr. Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or to question him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he did not tolerate was "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that harm freedom of expression."
"The biggest enemies of press freedom are not malicious or evil politicians but bad journalists in the pay of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
From this perspective, he welcomed the fact that it was not this kind of journalist "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than putting forward his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution to continue the path and chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay within Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts," because in reality "it destroys the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
Moreover, the Ecuadorian president considers "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime limits between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
For the moment, this judgment is not respected.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
They must be resolved as a whole in order to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the successful resolution of the maritime boundary dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court and affirmed that it is "beneficial for Latin America to seize international bodies if both countries agree to accept a judgment however firm it may be".
Referring to the possibility of his candidacy as a candidate in the future presidential elections in Ecuador, with a view to running for a third consecutive term, he said he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that, if he lost the February 2013 primaries, he would retire from public life.
On a personal level, power has never interested me, but in situations as unjust as those in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this eventual victory, but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last presidential term and I would then retire from politics.
If we ever lose, I will too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's new medical treatment in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse in President Chávez's health," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths today are due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when he was confirmed the test result: HIV-positive.
"It's as if the sky has fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, which the doctor had tried to make "less painful", to no avail.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take charge of his illness on his own and began to learn about it and his relentlessness was such that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is, without a doubt, one of the longest-serving patients in the HIV unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), where he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 90s, where there were many doubts, few treatment choices and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was speechless".
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, unaware of their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and fall victim to opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG,  Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he takes as a reference that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious disease specialist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a fatal disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of immune system damage that patients have at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who do not use drugs:  up to age 30 for a CD4 count of 200 and up to age 50 for those with a CD4 count of 500.
To put it simply, this means that for someone who receives a positive HIV diagnosis at age 25, "as long as they remain under control, will be able to live without problems until age 75," explained the scientist interviewed.
In order to put this progress in context, it should be noted that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who have died from AIDS has fallen from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), but it is also true that, since the emergence of AIDS, 60% of the patients recorded on the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths up to May this year; However, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I think the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the last 12 years at least, we have never run out of drugs, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know they are infected, or they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
He gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what is needed to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, for this, we must offer screening tests massively, to all people who request it".
Specialists and members of the Jalisco State Council for AIDS Prevention (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as do patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to be tested in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and, despite his young age, he was already a carrier of AIDS and suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma,  a cancerous tumour that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you find out you have AIDS.
Some think they are going to die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better that I have fun three times a week," they say, this is not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he has cancer.
I have a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, through his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the World AIDS Day march.
Whether they get tested, if they have taken risks, the sooner they know if they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message sums up the slogan of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programmes and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packs of a hundred, which is very good, but the result is that even today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among those most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do with it?", asked with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents do not want to hear, assures the journalist.
It proposes to redirect this inefficient distribution; that condoms not only be sold at counters, but that they be found in public washroom vending machines and in places frequented by young people.
It is not a question of encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying them the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"That's not how sexuality works, it's best to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active," he said.
The figures in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is the 4th state in the country in terms of new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th in terms of HIV patients.
92% of infections are sexual, 6% bloodstream and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people are living with HIV, since for every recorded case, there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it.
A judgment ratified on appeal by a U.S. court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt agreed to through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario sets a bad precedent for all national companies with branches in neighbouring countries and solvency problems.
It seems that the corporate survival procedures allowed by Mexican laws are not valid in the country with the star-spangled banner, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the June 15 judgment of Bankruptcy Court Judge Harlin Hale for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies defenseless against the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico's largest glass manufacturer to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge in the case noted that creditors must register under U.S. bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting in New Orleans, stated that the main proceeding was commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing cross-border procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a cross-border profile.
Indeed, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Trade Law had been created for that purpose by taking the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Second, the judgment establishes that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts incurred by Vitro's subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There are half a dozen examples here, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcy.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since there were still the votes of the subsidiaries, in any case the creditors of Vitro who fought against this in the courts of the United States, that is to say the "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained a majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
Data omitted by the appeal court.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation he had been facing since 2008 without stopping at the severe economic crisis facing the United States, passing on the costs to the country.
For now, the González Sada family company will appeal to the same appeals court to have the vote taken place in its entirety, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance lawsuit will claim non-prosperity and require a review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the U.S. Supreme Court of Justice.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, pointing out that this freed him from the agreements signed by the two countries to bring it on the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States bankruptcy law.
In addition, he pointed out that the country had complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cross-border insolvencies, which ensured fairness for debtors and creditors.
Pile-up of two parts: they knock out Vitro and they knock out the country.
Overall assessment
The complaints of the unions of the Mexican Aviation Company against the former boss of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were ignored for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Union Association of Pilots Aviators has already encountered problems.
The body, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just presented a criminal request against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied having provided information to the Attorney-General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to withdraw 198 million pesos from trust F/589 of the IXE bank in the name of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds were allegedly used to purchase shares in the Professional Hotel Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They besiege the Dragon Mart
Meeting this weekend in an amphitheater at the University of the Caribbean, a group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society endorsed the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of China's Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the Great Wall, with a residential area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Processing) had succeeded in uniting the governors of the South-East zone in order to oppose the monumental project which is partly located on protected areas and represents the greatest of all the threats weighing on the industry.
ACTA is dead
The government put forward a demand from the senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its English acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already history.
As everyone knows, this was done despite the fact that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was considered an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term Homex
In order to pay long-term debts without affecting short-term ones, real estate developer Homex entered the stock exchange market for 500 million pesos.
This issue is the first of four issues for which they propose to pay interest every 28 days.
Birth of Competival
Integrated by the companies NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leaders in IT, a new consortium called Competival has just been born, whose objective will be the market for clustering software services in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
Basketball globetrotter "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the court and, thanks to him, has traveled all over the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as much knowledge of the history of local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a cerebral hemorrhage condemned him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower-league player, a player on the national basketball team, a manager and executive of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or as president of the basketball federation.
"I have worn several hats in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 90s," Reyes recalled during a visit by Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel.  his faithful wife of more than 50 years.
"Basketball is my whole life."
Reyes is not exaggerating when he makes this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia reminiscent of his extraordinary itinerary, bear witness to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he loves the most are those that remind him of his time as a player with the Vaqueros team in the mid-50s until 1982, after spending 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships starting in 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or executive.
That's been a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired from the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, 'Cuco' Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead of the team," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been a manager here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a strong player for you, he is two meters tall.
Do you want it?"
That's how Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had, began.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had helped Bayamon win a championship, Gausse was going to help us try to win another.
He was delighted with the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only from a distance since in 1988 he was already the big man of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his responsibilities and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 Worlds, where we came 4th and we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had not made us replay the last game," said Reyes.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've seen?
She is one of the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and beat up the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the youngsters (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the 90 World Cup because of a knee problem.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it is Piculín Ortiz.
His statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín did.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It is very difficult to say.
We had a good team consisting of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I really like the work that Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest achievement within the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What is left for you to do?
There are things I would have liked to put in place, such as regionalizing minor categories.
For example, the boys of Ponce only play in their zone and only play against teams from other corners of the island in the national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when it is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff, and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
I usually listen to music, watch clips from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally attend basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide for the lead role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played an unscrupulous, formidable and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing on the TV series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday night from complications of cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., the production company of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again playing the ironic role he loved most," the family said.
Larry's family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, his press secretary, Jeffrey Lane, said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an exceptional person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Doctors diagnosed Larry Hagman with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he admitted to drinking heavily for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant liver tumour and underwent a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas," Hagman had made a name for himself on television as an ordinary guy in the NBC series "Jinny of My Dreams" from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also starred in two comedies that remained on the air for a short time, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film roles include critically acclaimed roles in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the delightfully detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman had his greatest success.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and their relatives aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", coined to maintain suspense around an emotional episode in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated speculation around the world and millions of dollars gambled in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers were in front of their screens and made "Dallas" the second most-watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which garnered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had impregnated her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave town, but other people also had reason to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who was trying to get his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) interned.
"I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R.," Hagman said in 1988.
One should write: "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing".
Here's the only game he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, recalled this Friday Hagman as a man "immense, both on the small screen and in life".
He is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of all of us, who have had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes has already been completed for the second season and a sixth is in the works, the channel informed.
For now, neither Warner nor TNT have communicated on how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who rose to fame with classic works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his debut on the stages of New York theaters in the early 1950s and then served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoir "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt anyone or affect them in any way," he told reporters at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist worried patients.
"I advise them, I give them confidence, I come with them when they come for surgery and after," he said in 1996.
I try to offer them some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it's going to be okay."
He has also been an anti-tobacco activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course on the "End of the World" has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irresistible hook: the end of the "great countdown" of the Mayan calendar, on December 21, which many people refer to as proof of the imminent end of the world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what lay ahead in the coming months: the catastrophic Sandy hurricane, a fiscal sinkhole that some have dubbed "the Armageddon of debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian end-time theorists thought the apocalypse would unfold.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever had," Professor Charmé told his students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If you analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were telling it, it was a very good time.
And we must remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he is not the only professor to give lectures on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker teaches the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human conduct.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze movies with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with real-life examples.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vacer said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to teach a course, simply titled "The End of the World."
"We are adding '2012' to have the opportunity to teach the course again, in case the world doesn't disappear," Professor Restall said.
Despite the "impending disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students with no choice but to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
The courses proved to be quite popular.
"It was sold out in two hours," Restall said of his course for high-level students, which consists of 35 students.
We received email messages several weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there was still room.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religion and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack thereof.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, says he's watched all the apocalyptic movies.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this subject," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone one professor, told us they believed in the December 21 end of the world.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and in a way we discredited it," says Julie Zegle, a 21-year-old senior Temple student from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it's only a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I concede that there is an apocalypse anxiety in Western culture, dating back centuries, that makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a surge in these speculations.
"In other parts of the world, people don't think about that," he said.
Most of this is the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew "the end of the world" was taught here.
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall points out that over the years there has been talk of the many supposed dates of the Last Judgment, and he claims that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing about the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a 7-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and professors take the date lightly.
Several told us they were thinking of going to "end-of-the-world" parties.
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh about it together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
