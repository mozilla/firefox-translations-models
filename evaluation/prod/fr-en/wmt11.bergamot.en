What's going to happen? CSSD does not have Voldemort or pastry in Prague.
The new elected representatives of CSSD at the town hall of the capital will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand each other at the level of the municipal council with their old and new collegues of the ODS.
The daily newspaper Actualne.cz 'tested' the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they know the arpart that was born in the last years of the town hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition who led in Prague.
The co-authored vocabulary that the political cream in Prague launched during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It was surprising that it was discovered that the newly elected officials did not understand the known terms very well.
At least they say so.
"Who is Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I'm a Father in Prague politics reacted Lukas Kaucky, the leader in culture testing the vocabulary of the 'god's vocabulary.
And as far as the political veteran is concerned, the elected representative Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole".
"That's the only expression among the ones you propose to me that I use."
Otherwise, I don't use the arloc.
From vocabulary, the daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June this year before the pre-ecrics of ODS, the editorial staff selected six examples, as a priority those related to the Prague City Council.
The Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", go to the patisserie, "beef nerve", "bias of the capital" and "entelling".
Three of the elected representatives agreed to the quiz, the fourth-angled-Antonin Weinert, which is to lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek turned down the test altogether.
"I am not dealing with these things at all and how the representatives of civic democracy are having fun: I will not give my opinion."
'I am currently dealing with the way we understand ourselves as part of our programmes,' he said.
As has already been heard, the elected representative Lukas Kaucky would not apparently recognize in the legend above that this is the influential Januseek over the entrepreneurs and friends of ex-Mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemorte" says nothing 'Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is 'the largest golf hole in Prague'.
'This is the Blanka tunnel,' said Kaucky and immediately adds: 'But I know it from the newspapers.'
"I'm going to have to pay for a language class," jokes.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the eluent for the environment, know that the golf hole is the Blanko tunnel.
The two Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks about the meaning of "going to pastry".
'I think it's about going to a company,' Plachy is about to guess that this is the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
In the same tone, Brezina reminds us that he draws his knowledge from newspapers rather than from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the test candidates, there is no tartoon lexicon in social democracy.
"I've taken advice with colleagues and it turns out we really don't have anything like this."
"You say the names sometimes sometimes we use abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Social Democratic Party, whom the Party members call Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," said Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The daily Actual.cz tested the name and it works.
The elected representative Weinert is Papy for Party members or the less friendly Little Old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by the scams during the party's sponsorship, is nicknamed "the little toy".
The nicknames are also the only ones that the Social Democrats admit to use within the party.
It is said that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda very much, but the daily Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this pragois president.
"Doctor in truncheon law" is said to have Kruna obtained his title of JUDr. right at the bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of the "witches", has edited a pamphlet.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
Rather, they are part of the old generation, cannot work, for example, for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The woman who becomes a "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man very rarely has this fate."
"Young women are not considered healthy either because they participate in the work and give birth to children," says a sister who is working in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He edited a pamphlet that should help limit witch-hunts.
The case includes a "hic".
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the Die Standard newspaper warned about the downside of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighbour of Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman, died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil that they had sprayed.
This information was transmitted by the BBC server.
Criminals claim that it was the bad eye.
According to their version, the oil used for the ritual anointings ignited in contact with the woman.
The oil appeared to be soaring when the team wanted to "hash the evil spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by people at all levels of education.
The daily newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Human spirit eaters have always been a danger," he says.
While Burkina Faso was trying to reduce the witch-hunt, the Gambia had even seen the President himself participate.
"President of the Gambia, Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a large witch-hunt which he seems to have participated in his death and reportedly strove through the black magic to kill the President as well."
"Shamans from Guinea near coming to the rescue took to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and the personal guard of the President, men and women chosen at random in the villages of the Gambia," Amnesty International said in a message.
On the farm, imprisoned people had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects that caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
On international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
Bakal's tenant: The poles are heating, he has signed a higher rent.
A large, buoyant man came out of the door of the RPG Byty customer centre of the "coal baron" of the "coal baron" of the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He was carrying a file under his arm with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his own, that of his daughter and his son who is serving a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent for these three persons.
Instead of paying 3,500, the yarn will have to pay from next year for a second-tier 4100 apartment.
"And there is no hot water and the heating works with solid fuel," points to his son's new contract as the man who has the power to sign.
"But I signed anyway," he explains to be angry and half resigned.
The citizens' association of apartments BytyOKD.cz, which described the standard rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December, when a notice will be published to explain the method to apply.
But man reacts to this with a gesture of the hand.
"One says that, the other says something else" frowning.
The Ostrava region became the laboratory for deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what awaits most apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not match the market price.
Aktualne.cz decided to personally visit the 'laboratory'.
The RPG waiting room in Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesdays at 9 a.m.
Right next to the door stands a guard of a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, "rent 2011", is turned on on the touch screen.
A single pressure and one paper with a number leaves the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" that your number is already lighting up on the big screen under the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a short while, an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern the people in the waiting room.
The majority of people came to solve common problems like everywhere - demand for reparations, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 RPG portfolio apartments receive mail with new lease agreements in their letterbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers rent increases of between 15 and 38 per cent.
The special counter for new rents has been open to the public since 18 November.
"it has been in operation for almost a week, so it's still on trial," says, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the counter when the client shows up as a journalist.
The derangement and the former apartments of minors in Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The Vice-President of Parliament and from the Ostrava region Lubomir zaoralek of the Social Democrats reported this fairly well before the elections and now fills local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change me a board put...n of board in the toilets, relieves himself in the introduction the mentioned man.
However, it is mostly, according to employees, pensioners who come to make sure that they will receive a discount on the new rent price if they sign now as RPG promised in a special offer.
It is a drawback of half of the amount of rent that other loctariae will receive who will have signed their new contract before 15 December.
But the "deregulation" window on Havirovaska Street is really not overwhelmed by the questions.
"Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent," says the employee at the counter.
And yet RPG porposes both on its website and in the showcases of individual interviews on rents when needed.
If the two parties do not agree on the rent, an independent court will take the decision.
'It is not a question of threats but only of informing about the unique and legitimate way of acting legally,' says RPG on its website.
"Here no one will go to court" thinks one of RPG Byty's employees and the man on the street in front of the customer center agrees.
"I have Neur 13000 in retirement and I have 5,000 kroons left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he says.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. She says, she says.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with early 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, that it is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However, in five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest in rents in apartments 4 billion, in four years of 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling in front of the upholstered armchairs of the Havirosvka Street waiting room, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
'The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 per cent and covers no less than 31200 apartments, i.e. more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments.'
'And it will always be at most 7.50 Czech kroner per m2 per month,' says the screen.
The 38 per cent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
'In these cases, this is an increase of a really very low sum of 19.66 Czech crowns per m2,' adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but gradual increase over 4 to 8 years.
She adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (cf. the graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of savings in heating - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on rent are given priority.
The nursery school is also part of the offices that have included the architects.
The Avriopoint de Brno administrative building is the new headquarters of Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also house a mini nursery school with everything needed - colored walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch. design employees have been able to visit.
The Archarchitectonic Project Society. Design: whose workshops produced a large number of buildings in Brno, designed its mini-school company since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employed about 90 people, especially of their age, and it was important for women architects and project managers to return to work quickly.
At the same time as reduced-time employment contracts, nursery school is a bonus offered to its employees by the company Arch. Design. as part of its social programme.
This allows builders and architects to combine work that is caring for children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design.eux themselves who imagined this nursery school and with the support of the management they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The Mini-Sternery School is financed by the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding allocations (to the tune of 2.8 mil.de Czech crowns). They were able to purchase equipment and appliances and after two years to provide qualified personnel and start-ups.
After using the financing endowment (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to run the mini-school from its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and it was the company Economy rating that helped to make the application for endowment.
Care for children was provided by qualified staff, and a nurse and a kindergarten teacher were caring for children; children could go to nursery school without age limit, but most of them were over three years old.
As it is a "minorary school", there can be only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more that can be replaced.
The functioning of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although it is a matter of individual care and education, the curriculum of the mini-school nursery school is comparable to that for pre-school education.
Children do not just play, but they are also taught to do so - from the beginning to the school benches are taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and not have the stress of being late in picking up children from a school away from the parents'place of work.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty is created between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is listed among companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The bone house is still fascinated after 100 years. Take a look in Gaudi's interiors.
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric saur, the staircase to a dinosaur spine and balconies to open fish mouths.
The Casa Battlo house in Barcelona is the architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house was given the nickname of the Bone House.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaics, facade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present curves, this is all that is ypic for the Art Nouveau by Antoni Gaudi.
The frontal facade of the house unrolls its dream lines, pleasant colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
In the course of a more detailed observation, the geometry, the rhythm and the order designed with precision.
During the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of the colors is reinforced.
The winding and the twist of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measurement.
Wood is a wave copy of window frames, balustrades, decorative elements of doors, eyelet and lamellae.
The Battlo house which stands in the Eixample district in the merchant street Passeig de Gracia at the number. 43, was born from the construction of a house in 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
Reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the old construction and the construction of another brand new but soon accepted Gaudi's idea of unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But Casa Battlo's idea as a multi-family house was not thought of by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It was precisely on his project that the decorations for a representation apartment of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade were born.
For the facade also worked on other artists and creators.
The joint work for the Casa Battlo house plans began with successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and the Guell Park in which there are other works by Gaudi.
The locals nicknamed the house hot just after it was finished because of its organic forms "the bone house".
Others, given the specific mechanism for opening windows, have called it the "silk house".
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint George the patron of Catalonia.
Other sculpture elements of the construction contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought of the house as a unique system of central heating, with typical ventilation vents and chimneys.
Their 45-degree inclination sounds weird.
During the creation of Gaudi, it did not comply with the construction guidelines of the time at the time and was not hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained the building permit from the city, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years after the finishing the city council was horrified and asked for modifications.
It was not pleasing, for example, to the members of the municipal council that the pillars of the construction encroach on the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the town Josep Battlo requested (and obtained satisfaction) permission to lease the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common lounge and in the third room a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which one accesses to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the living rooms and high society can communicate comfortably or limit themselves to the private space for more intimate maintenance.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi received in addition to new facades a non-traditional roof and two more floors.
Gaudi's game with light is also impressive, blue and white glazed tiles with which the inner courtyard is decorated and with the skylights.
The two-color game gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was enough simply to bet on the principle that white should reflect more than the dark, which on the contrary absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house, which was listed in 2005 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they found that it was a lucrative business and they extended the scope of visits to common areas and the attic, including roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs EUR 1650; students, pensioners, groups and tourist card holders have a 20% discount.
The sum is still above the price of entry into Gaudi's other buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a bed base: women have criteria other than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for bedtime, so the mattress and the bed base give a real base for a good bed.
They must of course complement each other harmoniously to please a specific user.
During the choice, several things are decisive: weight, height, age, state of health as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and the bed base are to be placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where latex mattresses are not continuously sleeped because they "warm" gently.
In addition, they have a weight greater than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they do not also have enough ventilation channels in their hearts and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mould may also form there.
Habiting is also crucial in choice.
Anyone who spends the clear of time abroad, where very thick mattresses with a slimming layer are frequently used, will feel very difficult to feel on a hard, low surface.
"This is how all the hokeyists who come back from NHL complain that they can't sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a stunty foam layer."
'Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder who therefore fill the 'information' of the joints and skin,' explains Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered hokeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything is working well, Tempur, Italian Magnifex but also Czech Tropico have, for example, appropriate mattresses.
You don't have to be an NHL guy to enjoy a lazy foam.
This 'miracle' simply works.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won't turn around in the night like after a tough game.
You just sleep better.
Lazy foam also works as a protection against waterfalls.
For the choice of mattress according to your waist, add the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman with a size of 180 cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or a total of 180 cm.
For single-place beds, for example singles, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should place your hands comfortably with the slightly folded elbows. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association des Bourreliers-Mattress-Framstresses and decorators, which has devoted itself for several years to the issue of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and the sign in specialized schools.
For a double bed each needs its own bed base and mattress, so be careful however during the arm to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you only have to mount the bed base at different heights and this is not possible on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of this count for the shape and ventilation layer at least three centimeters.
"Stretch or sitting on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Helen Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-specified type of bed base.
The sleep bed, when the mattress and the bed base are united as Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are very bad; it must not be washed, which is commonly done with dawn.
And since during the night we normally sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat, it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large (and clogged) sieve.
To this end, specialists refuse to apply for a lifespan of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime guarantee.
But everything to sound but.
And for this, an experienced advice from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140 cm, give up hygiene or washing for the coating of the mattress, but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even though nowadays it is common to manufacture coatings with zippers for the whole, that is to say after the opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine is very important) otherwise the manipulation for large models (and for a single person) becomes when they are taken out of a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight in a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed base instead of a bed base?
Never.
Maximum for a bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are no) with ventilation holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in sachets (from Germany Taschenfederken) and a layer of ventilation.
A polyurethane mattress shall not be part of a polyurethane bed.
For single-position lamellae bedboards with 14/18 slats, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more lamellae, 28 and above, where the lamellae are doubled in the lower part of the kidneys and so it is possible to regulate it.
For multi-position mattresses, spring mattresses should not be taken because it does not meet the changes of position.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the slats, it is also possible to install what is called a shoulder cradle.
This is a special connection of the lamellae which makes it possible to press or even incline the lamellae so that the shoulder of the sleeper "integrates" well.
For men who have "shoulders as wide as the back" is really an important thing.
This thing is already being considered by mattress manufacturers who for the "males" have started to use a branching area at the shoulders.
But they also think of women -- they're giving them a softer surface at the hips again.
For the most difficult client there are winged or plated bed bases with what is known as a multi-strand suspension.
The pressure spreads into more points and decreases the tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated with air) on good mattresses and bed base, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its tips must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that the Scandinavians for example prefer.
When lying on the side, the pillow should level (with the shoulder cradle of the bed base or the chest of arms in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first ones based on straw and grass.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also organic mattress.
The raw materials based on petrotheses, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybeans.
'The Bio qualifier for mattresses means that the core is made from natural products,' explains Petr vasicek from Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for coatings of mattresses; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add microcapsules that develop forest or lavender fragrances.
There are differences between men and women.
While the extract of birch plants so that the coating of the mattress absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the coatings "heat" the women.
The red pepper extract accelerates the blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weak sex.
The current favorites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cellular structure therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and have more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, the lower back and the feet are.
You'll pay a quality mattress from 7,000 kroons and more.
Those who are characterised by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached first place.
Saving for mattresses and bed bases is not easy.
It is possible from time to time to hold in special actions by manufacturers or producers two mattresses for the price of a single one.
For example, the company Magniflex, which offers Duofreeze mattresses with Memory memory foam sewn to coating for 11990 crowns.
We can, of course, take the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a great thickness was started with the Tempur material at a "cosmic" rhythm.
It started as a matter for NASA because astronauts were experiencing huge load factors at the start.
The Tempur bursts with heat and hardens, on the contrary, in the cold.
It therefore adapts perfectly to the hot human body and distributes optimal pressure to it.
It is ideal for this to be against slept and for increased comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot cushions that relieve the legs and the venous system.
Czech manufacturers use, for example, EucathermC or Twinsaver or similar foam.
Devices to follow people are increasingly in demand by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child leads more and more people to think about monitoring them through GPS.
The system, originally set up to search for cars, may as well be used to trace the movement of people and help in some cases as e.g. the model of little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a matchbox but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka has moved a large number of people and they have begun to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disrupt their privacy.
'We are trying to tell everyone that this is not something of espionage but only another way to reduce the likelihood of there being another tragedy,' says Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of tracing devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such appliances, such as putting it in the bags of a person who is not aware of it, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
'The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons,' adds Pilin.
In his view, children should always know for what purpose "the box" is used and how to use it in an emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention that if the child does not want to carry something like this, he will get rid of it.
'And even the smallest can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something on purpose when they don't want to be under control.'
'Mobile phones, which can be cut like these tracing devices, have already brought parents to long expectations,' says Bockova.
In her view, the fact that such devices could help in the event of aggression was highly questionable.
"If it is a prepared abduction, the author will do everything possible to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him".
"At the moment, it's the phone."
'As soon as tracing equipment develops, they (the criminals) will also look for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign.'
'In such cases, criminals will always be ahead of the police,' says the psychologist.
She nevertheless confesses that such devices can help with an unprepared assault by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, claims that having such devices can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of an assault.
"The apparatus may be parameterized in such a way that it is in regular transmission after a determined period".
"In the event that the apparatus is destroyed, the last position of the person concerned remains".
'More expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who has slipped and is in a lying position without moving,' says Cech.
According to him, so-called intelligent mobile phones, which are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after formatting it with special software.
The problem with current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to those worn as a pendant the size of a matchbox or to the smallest telephone devices.
You can always lose them.
According to Pilina from Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being carried out to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the aggressor, if any, will not be able to recognise the tracing device".
'Or he will realize it after a while, which will have given the police a little more time,' he adds.
Whether the tracing device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to trace cars.
This is a combination of GPS position acquisition systems (which is commonly used in autonavigation) and a function of a mobile telephone that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating cords that it could go around the Czech Republic with it. But it can only last two years.
The army purchased 445 km of cords used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence purchased 224 km.
The army therefore has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifespan of the cords is a maximum of two to four years.
The army bought detonating cords from the limited company STV Group for 40 million kroner.
The General Staff gave the reason for the purchase of a huge quantity of detonating cords at MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations to be held by army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES has contacted, it appears that even generals, officers with command, secretaries or household personnel should have an annual exercise in explosives.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence, and Vlastimil Picek, Commander of the army, are no exception.
Only to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating cords.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army's reserves could support it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals, it is sufficient to exceed 2 m of detonating cords, as the experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - also with the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the troops of the Rapid Intervention Brigade had recently complained to Minister Vondra that they had almost no ammunition for their handguns and that firing sessions were limited because of the need for money.
About the lack of body linen we don't talk about it.
"And I don't get my head if they buy from us so many detonating cords."
"And it's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"for us the army is a good customer that we strive as merchants to please," said STV Group Commercial Director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argued that hundreds of kilometres of detonating cords had the army had these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, reports only four years of lifespan of the detonating cords and the pyrotechnicians of the police and the army of only two years.
'If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it can go even up to four years,' says one of them, who does not want his name to be published in the light of the criticism of the army.
With the time spent, each munition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free of charge and still cost money.
The other argument of the ministry is a rebate due to the quantity per 445 km of detonating cord.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," said spokesman Pejsek, who spokes in the opinion of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating cords of the police pyrotechnicians who neutralize the munitions of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always only command the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their lifespan.
This has been established for safety reasons of pyrotechnicians and in order to be able to obtain more flexible more flexible types of detonating cords that are more modern and reliable.
The Ministry of Defence now has major problems in neutralising dozens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the two hundred thousand-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing to move, heading for the Rhine.
What awaits the Czech army in a few years' time that MF DNES has contacted: neutralising hundreds of kilometres of old detonating cords that it is now buying 'cheap'.
So far I benefit from the contacts I have obtained through the competitions.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun well for the winning position of the Best Individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of the Best Individual Entrepreneur contest for the past year was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure to success is like in a film.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Libérec there was a lack of quality hosting site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he earned when he was working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building with five half-demolished apartments.
Knowing that he was still a student in the very first year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
'The relationship between quality and the price of accommodation in our region made me want to do something,' said Lucas Pytloun.
He began to rent the first rebuilt apartment to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building which he converted into a board with 54 beds.
Since then, his work as a contractor has enabled him to open four guest houses, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of these were until very recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year it has come to him another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the Pytloun hotel franchise came forward," the number one entrepreneurs last year.
"And for the sale of the licence to run a large-scale hotel the victory in the Entrepreneur of the Year's Contest was well served," adds Pytloun with gratitude.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Libérec and its surroundings.
'People would recognize me in the streets, I often congratulated and, I have to say, it was very nice,' he recalls.
It recommends that the participation in this examination be given to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win, but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says that he has used his contacts and acquaintances so far that he could not have obtained in any other way.
"With those I met through the help I started to have regular business relations.
According to him, the success story also had an impact on the employees.
And it's about 70.
"I see in them above all the loyalty and pride of having committed themselves to something that has been generally recognised."
"It is not by far the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good job for all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was wanked by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the sense of the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind you.
The one who came to fetch the prize from Slovansky dum for the first place in the competition for the Firmme of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Odarsky, the owner of the Farmet company.
The jury rewarded efforts with which it transformed a tooling workshop in Ceska Skalice into a company with a turnover of 100 million kroner.
'I can say that the award not only encouraged me my collaborators as well and increased our self-confidence to fight competition,' says the winner of last year's contest today.
At the beginning of the Farmet history there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Odrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the communists, he did not hesitate for a long time, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with some comrades in his father's entourage for the manufacture of plastic bathtubs.
Not very long after they started specializing in vegetable oil presses.
After eighteen years, it became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the success of the competition through the media.
'Not only have our customers started to get to know the Farmet brand really better, but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were working with a company that got the most successful in its home country,' says Karel zdarsky.
But the past year has not happened in Farmet only in the euphoria of the victory.
The company's assessment was based on the 2008 economic performance and in part 2009.
And in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment plans and begin to limit their purchases of new equipment and technology.
"Of course, we have not escaped this situation".
'Returns fell by 40 per cent, and we had to limit our production and even lay off,' explains Karel zdarsky.
A viable society must be aware that unpopular action must be taken from time to time.
But they handled the situation properly and retained beneficial results even if they were less than they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued uncompromisingly investing in research and development.
'We built with the endowments a training and research centre, strengthened the company's presentation in international exhibitions and won the main awards in national exhibitions,' says 'Adarsky.
Everything leaves us to believe that the crisis is behind them.
The figures of the affires go back and with them the number of employees as well.
'To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere,' says Karel 'darsky.
The investigation that removes senseless regulations.
The investigation of the Absurdity of the Year was for the fourth time part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations have been removed.
The ungrateful winner of this year's survey of the Year was the obligation to provide documents that staff can obtain on-line in the offices.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for this.
For example, the social administration requested a paper extract from the business register, whereas the official could obtain it in two mouse clicks.
It changes through the survey.
"The Czech social insurance administration will no longer apply for the commercial register extract for insurance payment controls", said Jana Buranova, spokesman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSS).
Bringing out all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must complete in the Czech Republic and have those that are absurd remove is the meaning of this competition of the Absurdness of the Year.
This survey is still this year for the fourth time part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and is even more popular.
If 3,000 voters came forward last year, at least 4000 this year brought their votes.
And that's not surprising, there are the most diverse legal obligations in our country that only hold back the company, and, that, more and more.
'We may be among the number of documents to be filled in for tax returns in the world,' says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying entrepreneurial activity has become a proclaimed goal of all Governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is 74 in terms of conditions for the company, an increase of 8 places than last year.
The Awards of the Year Awards were introduced for the first time in 2006 and continue on the same scenario each year.
Anyone can report every year on the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to the end of September, the last deadline before the end of the competition.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. The contest organizer then selects seven candidates for "anti-price" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that received the largest number of votes was declared victorious.
Until last year's survey, a hundred, or more exactly, 105 regulations and deceit that lost their sense of existence.
The remarks are sent by entrepreneurs, but also professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore among the nominees, is, for example, the obligation that maintenance vehicles for motorways and expressways pay tolls, or that contractors with 20 employees, repertate two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of seven proposals shall be published on the competition website.
The proclamation of the competition, which always begins in early November at Wenceslaus Square in Prague, is part of a happening in which political and public figures regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, President of the Czech Republic Chamber of Commerce, attended the culminating moment of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts a bites in the legs of entrepreneurs and for that my goal is to eliminate, every year, at least three tens of paragraphs that today only complicate the business,' said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to suppress absurd deceit is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what did not please people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to report three days before the office to the sole proprietorship at the location of the business, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the implementation of the Single Enterprise Act.
The second most popular obligation in 2007, which was to declare a 30-day service tour to the Labour Office, was deleted with the so-called Green Card Act.
And everything is ok until the third session of the contest.
The 2009 Absurdity was the dedication for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by a prescription from the Ministry of Health last year- the obligation to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Environmental, humanitarian, training and all-a-museous projects are evaluated.
This year's novelty of the Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has already existed for five years, is the category called the Head of Manager of the Year 2010.
The idea of this competition is support for the reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that monitor their company's environmental impacts and engage in socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone, which is the guarantor and promoter of the contest, as in the case of the competition for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the 2010 firm's competition, organized by Vodaphone, registered the companies that have no success with a single long-term objective for the company.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be to be published.
Although the purpose of their enterprise is different from each other, their support and forecasting activity can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this concerns persons with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole of the Czech Republic is the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams for their employees who then participate in many tournaments in different sports.
Another example of a responsible firm in the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund that sponsors children with disabilities for 17 years.
The old paper-making plant in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 per cent of them and for this has won the title of the firm responsible for the Central Bohemia Region and which has placed third in the region in the competition for the Firme of the Year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, MiRyz Soft, a financial company, won for introducing flexible working hours and even reduced up to 35 hours per week on average and, without, in proportion, falling wages.
The jury also outsourced the title to her because it gave priority to Czech manufacturers, supported a dityness activity in the immediate environment and was concerned about the environment.
'We are trying to recycle as much as possible to ensure that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment,' explains Miluse Ryznarova, the company's executive director.
The company responsible IT Enlogit of the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up for each laptop a chair and keyboard ergonomics, encourages their homework and uses the catering services of a local protected plant for its actions.
'We also support the Lehomme dans l'ombre Foundation that helps the local Roma community,' says Ondrej Suchy, the representative of society.
At the very last rank is, also for its activities, a washing and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above standards.
'In our society we contribute to food, transport, increased skills and leisure,' says Joseph Strapac of the bruntal construction company Czasch, winner for the Moravia-Silesian region.
All the regional finalists for the Vodaphone's Circle of the Year competition were automatically registered in the Responsible Company category, who had responded to the attachment questionnaires in the registration document and referred it to the organizer by 15 August.
The poorly filled or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing firms had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the responsible firm but were not disqualified from the "principal" contest the 'Principal's 'Firme of the Year's contest."
'Independent registrations are not possible because it is a subcategory of the main competition of the Firm of the Year,' explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison-Rose.
At the Plzen Lands Fund, the police made arrests during a public competition
In the Lands Fund building in Plzen, the Anti-Corruption Police have made arrests in recent days.
The detectives passed the handcuffs to the local entrepreneur and real estate merchant Lubos. G.
The Government had endeavoured to handle a public tender for the settlement of a refund application in such a way that the proposed field was obtained by a particular candidate.
He had to pay Lubos G. half a million kroner.
"For the time being I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for insider dealing in a public tender and competition," said the head of Plzen's Plzen Prosecutor's Office, as it is forbidden to provide more explanation because the investigation is under way.
The police officers handed over the 46-year-old contractor to the age of 24 hours.
In order to know how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate in view of so little official information.
On a question from Pravo, the spokeswoman for the Land Fund Lubomira Cerna indicated that the police officers had actually made an arrest in Plzen at a separate workplace during the public competition.
"It was a customer and in no case an employee," she said.
The public competition according to Cerna is entitled "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land under the Land Law" and is set up when several eligible candidates appear.
"These individuals propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to resitugation which must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"Based on the proposed rights, a ranking of the purchasers is set up and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who has proposed the highest rights," explained the Fund's spokesperson.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information concerning the persons who had registered for the call and, as he is himself, also a beneficiary because he had bought a large number of restitution rights, he had proposed to the candidates on the ground not to participate in the competition.
And he probably took care of the fact of withdrawing.
This would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts well above standards at the Land Fund.
He was listed in the case of former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot, who was prosecuted in criminal proceedings for publishing land for which the decision to install a construction had already been published.
For example, Lubos G. had obtained land for the construction of public communications, specifically instead of the accessory area to the Borske Pole industrial zone, was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far higher.
The town hall was obliged to accept because otherwise it might jeopardize the construction by blocking the land.
Households will pay an additional 100,000 kroons per month for housing.
From January onwards, households will have to pay extra surcharge not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and rents will also increase.
Families will therefore have to shoot from their wallets up to 100 kroner monthly more than now.
Electricity is increasing by 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent more, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more the water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to be close to 100 kroner for households in apartments, which is already more than at present.
However, all suppliers have lowered electricity prices due to the significant development to encourage the manufacture of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
Gas is increasing moderately, but of course at a time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
It is therefore also possible to count an additional hundred crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest municipalities that plan the increase in prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay for central heating almost an additional 50 kroner per month, Libérec families will pay more than 1,000 kroons annually.
For the people of Prague is preparing for a 9 per cent increase in water and sanitation in the event that the city increases the rents of infrastructure.
If rents do not change pragois will pay an extra 6.8 per cent.
The price in Prague will be among the lowest compared to the country as a whole.
In North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are rising by 7.4 per cent.
Rent prices will, for example, rise significantly in the 450 000 rented apartments from January, i.e. at the end of regulation.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns almost 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who disagreed with the new rent increase would be brought before the courts by the company.
The regulated rents that people pay in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
The Czech children get drunk with rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts slowly.
Ferrnet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from the parents.
These are drinks that most often bring drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, in the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in hospital for reoffending are not the exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to admissions in the children's departments of hospitals.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be drunk".
'The trend is really towards strong alcohol,' says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Children's Department of Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to chip a dad's bottle in the cupboard, it's sometimes wisky but it's the fernet and vodka that prevail."
'Vodka has the advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not feel it,' explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesman for Motol Hospital, also proved him right.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"This is fashionable alcohol, especially in elementary schools".
"In some cases, it was slivorvice that they brought back from the house," added Jurinova.
According to the Head of the Pelinic Department, seeing drunk children between the ages of 13 and 14 at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he worked for ten years in pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren from the wide surroundings completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times
'She started her career at the age of twelve when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in blood with an additional mixture with ecstasy,' this particularly important case was the doctor.
"She was at the Horesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that it didn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter was absent for 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the disinterestedness of the parents or their extraordinary tolerance in the face of the fact that their offspring are indulging in drinking, which are the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
According to specialists, however, there is no talk of dependence, in its strict sense, on children.
"Under the term alcoholic is, we mean a chronic dependence on alcohol of several years with all the phenomena that follow from it but which are not found in children".
"In those who use acool repeatedly, it's more of a significantly unfavourable socio-familial back-ground," explained the Head of the Pelican Department.
According to spokeswoman Jurinova, about 40 drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the paediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with grafe poisoning require hospitalisation are integrated into the stratetics.
Drunger children who are after emergency care brought home by parents or the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pelan, he exestates three seasonal waves with which one can count: witches' day, Saint Sylves and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink out of spite after poor results or, on the contrary, they celebrate the beginning of the holidays".
"Of course I experienced an admission of seven children drunk at one shot," said Pelinkan.
The drunk child who spent the night in hospital in detoxciation under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who has returned home and suffers the day after the "hangover".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They're better off because they have an excellent evening and then a sweet alarm and nothing hurts them."
'They are only surprised where they are,' adds Pelika, knowing that from time to time this damagees patients' good humour at least with the bill to pay for their care.
ambulance transport and intensive care hospitalization can be as much as tens of thousands of wreaths.
'Once in time, I applied this as a means of education by counting on these children how much their drunkenness cost and that they could spend the whole summer in seasonal work to pay back a single evening,' added Pelama.
However, in his view, health insurance companies in their declining management, which should recover care-related expenses from parents, do not deal with cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L-159 aircraft of all five, against which the Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off on Tuesday for Seville, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is based.
This is the first time that such aircraft have become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
They have, however, been abroad in the context of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seat versions of the L-159T1 which were until now in service in the Czech Army and were in flight.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seater versions of the L-159.
They are currently stationing at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the company Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Ministry of Defence Press Department, the physical departure of Vodochody's aircraft is currently unknown.
'The single-seater L-159 aircraft intended for the exchange have been taken from aircraft that have been stockpiled for a long time without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence.'
"The two-seater L-159 T1 were exchanged in the state," said Pejsek for Pravo.
He added that the army would not remain without two seats as the ministry signed an agreement with Aéro Vodochody in May 2009 worth DKK 200 million for the conversion of four unused L-159 cars into two two-seaters.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second scheduled for delivery at the end of that year.
According to Pejsek EADS, he undertook to introduce aircraft into the equipment of certain Alliance countries.
"In the contract it is clearly stated that the person taking L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will be used for training pilots from NATO countries."
'It is therefore the case of the one who takes into account how to achieve this,' said Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army was not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner were endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence did not issue a call for tenders and contacted EADS directly.
The defence director then argued that the exchange ensures a future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and used only 24 aircraft, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft is likely to have legal implications.
However, the European Commission has lodged a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence with the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been chosen in the context of a call for tenders on a European scale and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa aircraft, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the ring finger is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have older index fingers than the ring finger are at lower risk of having prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
'Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men before the age of 60,' said co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, in particular by combining with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health antecedents, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
For them, as for the 19 percent of those with their fingers of the same length, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
In the case of those with the older index than the ring finger, however, the risk fell to 33 per cent, for men before the age of 60 the reduction in risk reached 87 per cent.
The ratio of length of the two fingers mentioned - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
A longer index is less testosterone.
Previous research had shown that testosterone helped develop prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said for CTK that he is aware of this study but that he does not seem to him to be the relationship between finger length and cancer to be "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is this Thursday morning covered by snow.
On roads and sidewalks, there is mostly compact snow, the decasses have been working all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd km in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents involving lorries and cars and the D1 road in Brno in the direction of Prague is in the same way.
The dispatcher of the Automobile Club Central (UAMK) told the news
At the 91st kilometre a truck was crashed, at 93rd two heavy goods vehicles hit each other, the accident injured.
Several cars also found themselves in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at the 185th km in the direction of Prague.
Two lorries hit it
Drivers should go out just after Brno at the 190th kilometre or go by Brno and then enter the 182nd kilometer in Kyvalka.
A line of cars of several kilometers formed there.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Searches of cars are being created, for example, in Prosek, Sterboholska Street, is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams are lagging behind, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff still has to meet.
Railways and the airport also face problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to eliminate 7 fast links due to snow.
Lines, for example, from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Passengers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne airport has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. in the night until 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are already roaring but redegiate vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three lateral roads are impassable, on the road to Brno there are bursts of snow in places and on the Blansko road the chains are mandatory to pass certain communication routes in the places placed above.
The Vyskov region was among the most affected places.
So far the axes are closed: Rusinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saractics-Milesovice
To clean them may have to be sent snow-snow and strawberry.
We can't estimate when they're going to be rollable right now.
On the way to Hodonin, caution is required in the White Carpathian region.
On roads which are, in view of nature protection, maintained only by the spraying of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 cm of snow warns CTK.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two and 10 centimetres of snow; it fell the most in northern Bohemia, often with up to 18 centimetres of snow.
In the region of Moravia-Silesia, it fell to 15 centimetres of snow.
The snowfall gradually disappears in the Czech Republic.
Americans have a new 'smart weapon'
The U.S. Army sent a new "smart" weapon to Afgtanistan, known only as the XM-25 code.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super-precise gun
Its projectiles are laser-guided with an accuracy of a few meters.
Special ammunition of 25 mm calibre developed for this rifle and containing a highly broken explosive, in fact functions as small grenades.
The munitions can be programmed in such a way that they will explode in contact with the target but also at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
Nor is he protected from above, and when he falls on a deadly rain of steel splinters, it can put him out of action as well.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "smart" technology.
"The soldier essentially uses it in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam which determines the distance, thus obtains a precise sighting point, according to which he corrects his sighting and presses on the trigger.
"Let's say you've been aiming for 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the weapon loads and shoots at a distance of 543 meters plus 2.1 meters," said Audette.
400 jobs relocated
Fujitsu relocated its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will move their workplace to Astro Park, which is currently in the office building at Mareinbader Square in the Bad Homburg area.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocated its Bad Homburg branch to Frankfurt.
As the giant specialising in computer manufacturing and maintenance on Wednesday, next year in July, the 400-man and women's workplace, located so far in the town of Bad Homburg's square, will be relocated to Astro Park, a huge office complex on Lyon Street Straze in Frankfurt's Niederrad district.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, the group is expected to bring together another 100 jobs still scattered throughout the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive. In addition, Astro Park's open-air offices are more suitable for the working mode of employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was just tenant.
Managing Director Bernd Wagner said: 'Frankfurt-Niederrad is a crucial location for us with a remarkable infrastructure.'
He claimed that connection to the airport was of great importance to a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company inside the region yesterday aroused the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The Head of Economic Affairs of the Municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), stated that once again, a "planetary actor" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of location".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its location is an important boost for Niederrad.
The Mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (the greens), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The management informed the municipality of this intention at an early stage.
'It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this endeavour,' said Mr. Korwisi.
However, friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer in the face of the owner of the Marienbader Square building.
In the end, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
The challenge now is to prevent an exceptional place from remaining unoccupied for a long time to come.
"I hope that the owner and lessor of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the Town Hall Square building, previously used by the Fujitsu company and the nearby "small vertical", as well as the rest of the buildings of Marienbad Square, were part of the controversial project of construction of the spa.
The result of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the railway station and the Town Hall. It aroused a great deal of criticism, not only because of the impressive layout of the areas that used to be partly used as a parking lot, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment advice company, Feri, the manufacturer of computers for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, a computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Frankfurt specialty group Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were resold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Group considers itself to be the third largest supplier of IT products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides the essential service.
Its branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has many more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, moved from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad. Other subsidiaries on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this purpose, 7,000 square metres were rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name is reminiscent of its star-shaped plan, houses, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of the electronic and electrotechnical industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats to Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is finding it increasingly difficult.
The Internet service provider Amazon has expelled the site specialized in the disclosure of confidential documents from its servers.
This may be a consequence of political pressure over the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, M. Assange, apparently stayed in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is attacked with ever more force.
The group of cyber activists "Wikilaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the eminent American Senator, Joe Lieberman, called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is probably staying in Britain, according to newspaper reports.
"Wikileaks excluded from the Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom", said on Wednesday (local time) the cyber activists behind the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Little before, the cyber-company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the secret diplomatic notes were issued, cyber activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to reach the largest number of accesses to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Formidable, our dollars are now spent on caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem for Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
The CNN television channel, citing Mr. Liebermann, reported that Amazon banned Wikileaks from using its servers after Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators' investigation.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon website to orchestrate a boycott against him, the British newspaper, The Guardian, reported.
"I would have liked Amazon to have taken this step earlier in view of the previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," said the Senator.
At the same time, Mr. Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, monstrously and unscrupulously. By doing so, it puts our national security at risk and endangers life all over the world", according to a statement by the independent senator.
"No company that is aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to disseminate the content of stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, M. Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of persons wanted by Interpol.
According to information published by the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber activist has consistently described Sweden's prosecutions against him as intrigues orchestrated by his detractors.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats were made against the site.
"Calls were even made for the murder of Julian Assange."
This is why Assange is particularly concerned about his safety, said Hrafnsson.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson was clearly reacting to statements made in North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that those responsible for Wikileaks revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, the adviser to the Head of Government, Mr. Stephen Harper, on television, clearly stated on television in a serious way that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone."
Meanwhile, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for the US President, Mr. Barack Obama, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Mr. Assault demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed, to engage in espionage activities.
'I do not know exactly why we have to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website,' says Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of that country are far more important than the assertions of a website."
The US government is now completely on the test bed of the protection of its databases.
According to a White House statement, Mr. Russell Travers, deputy director of the Counter-Terrorism Centre, has been appointed responsible for combating leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for putting in place "the necessary structural reforms" made necessary after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House is also willing to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the US government has announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they are ever threatened by Wikileaks revelations.
"We have made every effort to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where does all the ice come from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. the somewhat old-fashioned ice-cream in German, makes the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making art.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated window using a spatula, places it in the waffle and then starts selling it.
To find out, there is no need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about the ice cannot avoid "Gelato-University" from the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of the ice creammakers founded the ice university in 2003 so that ice creams from its machines meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice and spanning several days are also offered. In the same way, practical sessions are organized in the private ice industry.
In the mid-circumvent of quarantine, a number of people dream of a new career, others are simply at risk of realizing their ardent desire on the smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia via Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of art education from California, is a fan of the Slow Food movement. He wants to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial ice in the future.
Anke of Berlin is a business management adviser and, after a few years, wants to draw something from this nerve-tripping profession.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream factory in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housekeeper came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice.
It is decisive not only for good flavor, but also for silky flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the formation of the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, from the south: 'Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a great deal of romanticism.'
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything at 85 degrees thanks to an electronic program, then immediately cools to four degrees.
It then opens a tap installed on the machine: it comes out of a pasteurized basic white cream, the basis of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer was immediately attacked by question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can we give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warns against the fact being misled by the spirit of the times.
Anyone who speaks only of ice creams 'made from natural ingredients' has nevertheless nevertheless used stabilisers: most often a natural product, for example guar seed flour obtained from guar beans.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will chew nothing other than ice-cream granules.
Some changes in the base mass are permitted.
It becomes more exciting with aromas.
The Luciano master makes the difference between the ingredients that are acquired in the fruit or confectionery shelf of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to give you dozens of flavoured ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Or in fruit sorbet recipes with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs, becomes a yellow cream and, when cocoa powder is added, constitutes the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants in the course must move on to the use of ice machines.
Luciano occasionally invites them to make four kinds of ice creams: vanilla, chocolate, moka and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base body, with more or less vanilla flavouring or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit ice cream are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purees: from the point of view of taste, it is not absolutely better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily have the taste of walnuts, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
Kiwi ice is very popular from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
'Only a balanced mixture correctly raises the taste of an ice cream,' says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice is a calculation exercise: if peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the quantity of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is required for lemon ice cream.
Luciano has an apparatus with which it determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (the winemakers use them to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate the calculations.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires, as in the past, so much physical intervention.
It is not only the automatic base mass manufacturing machine that helps.
There is also an apparatus in which the available ice mixture is simultaneously beaten to make it creamy and brought back to negative temperatures.
Despite all automations, slight breakdowns are not excluded.
Brazilian Gustavo smears with fruit mashed from head to toe and thus shattered his fellow studies when the control of the colossal mixing bowl escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that an "incident such a risk of occurring in each course: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry testing for the cultivation of genetically modified plants has formed the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an independent institute for assessing the consequences of biotechnology.
'It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we inquired about it,' Munich said on Wednesday in Munich. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech.
There are indications that the Chairman of the Efsa Expert Group for Genetically Modified Plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, along with other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi lobby.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has worked decisively to develop Efsa test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to critics made by Mr. Then.
The requirements developed correspond verbatim, by subparagraph, to the positions taken by the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the mark of the industry which, at the bottom, would be controlled by the authorities based in Parma, Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech has denounced a conflict of interest.
A senior manager of Efsa recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta without conditions or without a transitional period. In doing so, she changed sides.
Not long ago, even Central Germany Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed the existence of personal relations between the EU's control authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused suspicions both of the German Federal Environment Agency and of the Members of the European Parliament.
However, Efsa does not admit the existence of any conflict of interest.
There is an opinion that all reliable data, including those of industry, are used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of Efsa are not prohibited from entering into contact with this industry.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the United States-based International Life Sciences Institute (IFSA).
This body sees itself as a neutral forum bringing together experts who belong, inter alia, to the field of science, industry and policy in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the pay of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disapprove of the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feeding trials and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
'We want to know what the impacts of genetically modified maize are causing the field,' says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only the isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results to be obtained.
'If we don't look for the risks, then how can we find them?" Then in an accusing tone.
That is also the point of view of Mrs Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientist has been conducting research in the field of genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Polytechnic School in zurich.
In this region as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
As a result, there are only still researchers who are not linked to companies.
In the opinion of the companies, the critical studies would not be published.
Ms Hilbeck said that "the industry controls safety research".
The Stone Trace
Uli Gsell got a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart station with her tube on her back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: By September, the excavators had come and began to demolish much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: several thousand people demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart Central Station into an underground station that will cost billions.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations led to the halting of the construction work.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (shellfish limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft, coarse pavement badly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor residing in Ostfildern.
There were some fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthusiastically states: 'a modest and cheap rock, simple and earthly'.
He claimed that by cutting it out of the saw, he smelled the cigarette smoke.
He doesn't yet know what he'll do with this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The traces of the Stuttgart stones lead to a former ammunition depot of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man trades old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappeared in the landfill," he said in his office in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He recounts that he was subjected to insults and threats when in September the newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for whole days with opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to keep using the stones.
About 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently carried one of the parallelepipeds of stone weighing on average 80 kilos worth between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a memory in yet hoping also to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of one truck.
About half is still crammed into the forest, the rest having been sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, private individuals.
They came from everywhere and took away everything that could enter the trunk and the trailers.
These sandstones of Stuttgart have long since turned into "Muerle" or the limitations of grass beds.
'By the way, this stone is nothing special,' said Mr. Rongen.
"have this political component been the case."
He enters his off-road car, travels around his vast 20-hectare empire.
He had a law education which he had dropped out. Later, he began to study biology before subsequently focusing on computer science and eventually becoming a carrier.
And a stone lover.
It stores 40,000 tons.
It is treasured all over Germany.
He claims that he is the largest merchant of ancient stones.
It refrins itself.
Sandstones carved with art are laid on the snow.
"In the past, they were part of the Marienbrucke Bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he says enthusiastically.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes up through the forest.
It shows a heap of a finger: Red Sandstone, previously, part of Karlsruhe Station.
And so on.
"Beautiful travertine."
The parallelepiped was once part of the tribune of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Throughout the snow of stones and stories, the travertine of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the reddish granite coming from the Cathedral of St. Blasian, the tuff from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, what efforts, what a sweat.
When Mr. Rongen thinks that once the stones were carved by hand and moved with simple palans and carts pulled by oxen, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were to be put to pieces."
He didn't get rich, let alone rich.
But this carrier now employs 14 people. In addition, stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener settled in the forest.
'We work hard, but it's rewarding,' says the waste recycler.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There, too, there are stones to save.
Talent struggle to gain high potential
The counter has a sharp influx.
16 students are jostling to buy salmon rolls, tomato sauce and white pantry.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of a kind of competition of ideas, they have to talk business about the car of the future with the VW designers, and, by the way, get to know the Volkswagen company.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go hand-to-hand in competition to find better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to recruit as far as gifted graduates as possible in amphitheatres before they enter the labour market and are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about their students' performance, we try to identify exceptional talent in practical projects and retain them.
On the second day of the workshop at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the car group loves talent.
A young lady from the staff department shares pens, sweets and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the calendar of professional internships and student jobs for young talent; she shows them the paths to access the group's premises.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: 'Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience.'
'As for the Volkswagen Group, he can get to know the students, take a closer look at the serious candidates and appreciate those who are involved as a collaborator.'
According to Mr. Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive with which we're trying to attract the students.
'In the past, the focus was more on the professional project,' says Mr. Saddle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much more awful.
In sector property, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting out a host of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and, above all, wreak the eve of highly skilled labour.
Graduates from engineering fields are especially in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German engineers' association VDI, more than 40,000 engineering posts remained unoccupied in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the engineering vacuum will further widen.
Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt for KPMG, an audit, accounting and consulting firm.
It organises expensive talent-recruiting events, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of paper rally where competitors have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel the United States in this way.
Participants can access the subsidiaries of KPMG and get to know the company.
The person who is to take part decides in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used to quest for high potential in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to stand out from the crowd through the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
For the talent hunter, Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"Until today, we have been in contact with all those who took part in a similar action last year."
'Some of them are about to complete their studies and wish to send their requests to our company soon,' he says.
Apart from the direct acclaim on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises do a very traditional way by participating in the professional fairs where they hunt brains.
"We're trying to reach graduates by participating in trade shows."
'For example, at the Solar Technologies Fair,' says Ms Sitha St. Be, Director of Human Resources at Solarworld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company based in Bonn employs around 1500 people in Germany.
She was aware of the problems relating to succession.
Currently, 35 posts are being put to the company's website.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
'It's expensive and time-consuming,' he says?
Another way to establish contact is to pass through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
'The teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to do professional internships or write his or her end-of-study project at home.'
Expensive advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
That is why the company is trying to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalised atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
'Often a large group cannot do that,' said Ms St. Be, the Chief of Staff.
Money has not played the leading role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are the other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual honorary table of German employers.
To this end, it questions the staff on their level of satisfaction with their work and context, while looking at the framework conditions of employees.
She hoped that the placement would enhance the image of the company among job-seekers.
'I think candidates rely mainly on external evaluations for a potential employer,' she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that wish to build a good reputation as an employer by implementing a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler means, first and foremost, taking internal action.
'The best way for an employer to get attractive is through its own employees,' he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"satisfied collaborators are the best messengers."
When their employees are treated well and they identify with the company, they advertise their employer by themselves to their friends and acquaintances.
'It's like playing in an orchestra,' says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, the southeastern state of the United States, in the years to come.
The Washington government has imposed an equivalent ban and thus definitively cancelled its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited for the time being.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement on Wednesday.
The explosion of the "Deepwater Horizon" drilling rig in April was the origin of this strict ban. It must remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of the accident, which cost eleven employees and the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had indicated his readiness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents of this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries on oil supplies.
The question of who bears responsibility for the devastating oil spill in golf is not, to date, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is faced with multibillion claims, is at the centre of the charges.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the drilling freeze after the platform exploded.
As a result of that decision, different oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter control measures and tougher security instructions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another catastrophe.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after numerous accusations of corruption, is currently undergoing in-depth reform.
At the same time, Mr. Obama has announced that they will eliminate the lucrative tax niches of gas and oil groups.
Actors in this industry are now publicly warning that the feed in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
"The government's objective is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector" as a result of a current survey in the sector by the audit firm BDO, ahead of the drilling ban on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterises this sector: 'Nobody knows exactly what will change with regulation.'
Investments in new support projects have been postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
The country Ogoni is dry
The water flowing into the rivers is oiled brown; it smells similar to that in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live on theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't be exhausted," the environmental activist told reporters to calm them down: "You still have enough mud in front of the water lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young person sunk into muddy water to the chest, as well as the greasy drag surrounding him: This scene looks almost beautiful in the brightness of water to the rainbow color.
It cannot be seen that the basement is full of brown layers of crude oil.
On the bank of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom recounts that, in the past, she collected shrimps by whole buckets here.
But in the meantime, calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil sprang from a pipeline that exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen living in the small town of nearby Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach fish waters: the Ogoni country in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered to be one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The whole extent of the devastation is obvious when the mangrove marshes crossed by rivers are traversed.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat splits mad brown water. Anyone who plunges his hand into it removes all oil-covered.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the ground like liquorice sticks. The isolated palm trees sadly allow their palms to hang.
We're looking in vain for the clouds of birds, as we usually encounter in wet areas: As soon as the outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence falls on this paradise of old that looks like a service station by the smell it gives off.
'What is happening here is a war against the environment,' says Mr. Celestine Akpobari with a sad air: 'Our life is characterized by a permanent health hazard.'
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a battlefield that has been besieged for decades: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. In 1993, the Shell Group had to stop production activities in this area because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the return to the Ogoni country is prohibited for this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 wells and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines in the entire Delta region, three times large, like Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are untapped, because the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
Every one hundred meters stands in the water of steel trestles as bizarre sculptures: It is very affectionately denote "Christmas trees" the drilling hole heads.
They are up to 50 years old, most are corrosion-drained to the mark.
Akpobari believes that a drilling head of this nature breaks from time to time in pieces, as a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts' estimates, more than two billion litres have spilled over the ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil equivalent to that in the sea during the 'Exxon Valdez' super-oil accident 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Who should bear responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell Group, the sabotage and siphoning of oil pipelines is responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, consider drilling head explosions and perforated oil pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, US researcher Richard Steiner blamed the Shell Group for applying essentially lower safety standards in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of pipeline failures is "not much higher than the allegestity".
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, seen from a distance, resembles an abandoned workshop, full of bamboo and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with bamboo to the neck.
A fire is sparkling under one of the many barrels that sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without reason on the site, must be reclaimed: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours, says Michael, the team leader.
Initially, the gasoline enters a container through pipes, then, at the end of the pipe drops of kerosene falls and diesel is finally obtained.
This is how Michael and his four collaborators produce four 300-litre diesel drums every day: 'This brings us 34,000 Naira', about 22 dollars.
The people of the Delta are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a cheaper price than the ridiculously low of just 40 euro cents per litre of Diesel: because they buy their raw material free of charge.
This is offered by the "protectors" who pierced the network of pipelines throughout the Ogoni country. According to experts, the country is thus losing at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small, quite insignificant part of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally purified: the organized crime networks, which are also among its members, politicians and high-ranking military personnel, charge the lion's share in tankers and re-winning it on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers that the debate on whether to attribute the environmental catastrophe or rather subversive activities to the population or to the lax mode of production is purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of fishermen's lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no theft and illegal refineries."
But, in the meantime, the Ogoni's mostly relations with Shell have deteriorated so much that it was no longer a question of the group's withdrawal. "Perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will be better."
Then Michael gets nervous.
"It is high time you were to get out of hand," says the robust oil worker.
"Soldiers can appear at any time."
If illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most will offer them bribes.
Even soldiers, especially from the north of the country, want to benefit from the raw material like all Nigerians.
"In every way, this damn thing has brought down our country very low," Akpori laments.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 clearly suffers from a major security problem.
By examining an aircraft that made an emergency landing, the investigators discovered a possible constructional defect that could lead to "catastrophic failure of the reactor."
The airline Qantas now wants to file a complaint against the manufacturer of the reactor.
In early November, Airbus passengers belonging to Quantas had visibly luck so far: during its investigation, the Australian Aviation Safety Authority found that the jet engines of some A380 aircraft were serious safety concerns, and warns of a possible construction failure.
This potential failure could have serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leaks at the connection of the oil pipe, according to a position statement published on Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a "catastrophic failure of the reactors".
This includes Rolls-Royce reactors and fitted to 20 A380 series aircraft.
The Quantas Airbus, which had to land emergency on 4 November in Singapore, is one of them.
The Australian airline has now initiated legal proceedings against the British reactor manufacturer.
It filed a court complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney. This approach gives it the opportunity to take other legal measures against society.
The Director of Quantas, Mr. Alan Joyce, stated that his company would claim damages in connection with the incident in early November.
Parts were spared and the load-bearing area was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, oil ignition is causing damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety tests will be carried out on the superjumbos, which are also equipped with the relevant reactors.
The safety recommendations are the result of collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASSB spokesman. Martin Dolan.
The safety problem is considered to be sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of its aircraft, Quantas had grounded its entire A380 fleet for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily detained three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa replaced the reactor with an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The two-storey aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall across the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany is all covered in white: In one night, the snow fell on almost the entire country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are grounded.
At least three persons have died in road traffic accidents.
Winter is shivering Germany: By freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimetres in places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On the A7 national in Flensburg, the staff of the winter service worked permanently, but they could not cope with the snow that was constantly accumulating.
In addition, violent guss swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Bureau of Maritime Navigation and Hydrographic (DSH) expects the tsunami to take place on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels of up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow clusters on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the bad weather station Meteomedia has announced the purple alert level has been announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, this is the highest level.
In some places, 30 centimetres of fresh snow fell, which was dispersed by strong and fresh winds.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in the Saxon-Anhalt Land, police authorities have announced serious disturbances on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind resulted in traffic interruptions and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall hits the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious rail traffic disruptions have occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on railways, trees falling on railway tracks, overhead lines or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, the Interregional Leipzig-Nuremberg transport had to be discontinued.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train bound for Munich had to interrupt his journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers on the train with blankets, food and drink.
Snow winds swept the roads.
Snowfalls have led to numerous flight cancellations at the main airports in Germany.
According to a spokesperson for the standard and flight information, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport said that 40 flights had already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that there are no more passengers trapped at the airport, despite this very little 400 beds, at their disposal.
Accidents occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Because of the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was hit at a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car turned ablaze on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce good news: the snow will certainly always be soft and powdery, but it will swirl in case of light bursts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by strong and rapid winds.
However, it is very cold, up to minus 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its Twin Towers.
The Deutsche Bank is seeking to separate itself from its emblem: According to newspaper reports, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its Frankfurt headquarters.
This building could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just been to beautify the group's headquarters: the twin towers in the Quartier d'affaires have been modernised; in the meantime, the bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
From now on, the financial group is clearly seeking to recover the costs of renovations and it is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, quoting a spokesperson.
The spokesperson did not state the reasons for the planned sale.
He said 'we are checking whether it is more interesting to occupy buildings ourselves or sell them, and to rent them again later'.
Thus, the largest financial institution in Germany has already sold its registered office shortly thereafter.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank acquired the twin towers of EUR 272 million from equity holders. They then rehabilitated them.
Changes to energy optimisation have been embroiled, according to some indications, around EUR 200 million.
A sale would, of course, bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector estimate the value of the towers, which has now been renamed "Green Tours", to around EUR 500 million.
According to the spokesman, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be re-sold to a bank or independent investor fund.
Thousands of people are mourning the minors who have perished.
More than 10,000 people were thought-out for buried miners who were declared dead as a result of several mine explosions.
The bodies had not yet been able to trace the bodies because the security situation of the affected well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the affected well, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent other explosions, no rescue team was able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration had considered that the minors no longer had any chance of surviving.
Until now, the bodies could not be reassembled.
Today, relatives and friends organized a party in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people gathered under a bright sunshine at Greymouth in the south of the island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, 29 tables were installed on which the names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photographs and personal effects, including clothing and surfboards, also belonged.
The flags were flown at half in front of all the public buildings in the country.
The Prime Minister, John Key, told the participants at the commemorative celebration that New zealand had harboured the hope that the miners would rise to the surface.
"But they never got home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son zen was buried in the pits, stated that he cannot resign himself to accepting his son's death until he sees his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Minors of South African and British origin also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
The rescuers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine in the South Island of New zealand.
Police prefect Gary Knowles explained to reporters that when the masses of explosive gases are displaced, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to fall.
Go to hell, warrior.
Is the film Splatter an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the old genre through his film, "Walhalla Rising", an epic of the fighter.
To which audience could Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of by filming "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) possessing only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his executioner and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal murder methods. When in a bad mood, he pulls the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to be dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the one-bodied says no words about his real name. Even the other characters let escape, at most, at the bend of one or two sentences a few terrible screams of agony.
Otherwise, we don't say anything and we feast in the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland that is the setting for the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal plus mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent tracking.
When a film targets several target groups, it is a pity that they are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy of the fierce and full-style drug dealer, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality in art and essay cinema.
Most art movie supporters have to experience horror from the brain that spreads all around and the gut.
Lovers of action films die from boredom when the blind embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned for eternity by calm and haze before the crew arrives in America and continues to remain silent.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" has not found any film distributors in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
It is above all because of the magnificent images of misery that has deserved a certain attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, is hidden behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It's not about dialogue in this film, it's not a coherent action, it's all ambience, a feverish dream turned into a movie.
The spectator cannot escape.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with icy images and a gloomy soundtrack, but especially with an elusive hatred that springs from the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who stands faithfully alongside the one-eyed man, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the blind hero whose motives are never known, but who comes back from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by turning into a warrior, is perhaps sent from the devil himself.
It represents the rottenness, but perhaps also, just for those who are, in any case, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, whose purpose is annoyment, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new guidance on a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, let alone submit to the controls of the agency.
On the night of 5-6 September 2007, around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the bank of the euphrate; the largest city nearby is 30 kilometers away: it's Dair as-Sur.
His name is included in IAEA documents, as it is a question of the reactor that Syria has apparently built with the help of North Korea in a stone parallelepiped, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a briefing by the United States intelligence services, the CIA, dating from the end of April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighbouring locality, el-Kibar, would be well suited to produce plutonium, which would make it possible to manufacture atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video featuring fuzzy satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the likely location of each reactor component prior to the plant's destruction, which represents a miniature copy of the north Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photographs showing the building located nearby, or even inside it.
It appears that the reactor was about to be put into operation, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, little more information is available than at the time, and even, over time, the mystery is growing thicker.
Former United States President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was certainly confident that Syria had built a reactor in al-Kibar, but had little evidence of that country developing "an active nuclear weapons program".
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and only talk about an "alleged reactor", even if they regard the CIA's presentation as 'plausible'.
They lack hard evidence, as well as in the IAEA.
Asked how he ensured that he was dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior United Nations diplomat gave only a laconic response in the summer, stating that the IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions".
The Syrians have certainly hastily removed the rubble of the "unused military building" and proceeded to a methodical levelling of the terrain.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of human-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite images from a member State of commercial providers showing the time directly following the attack, and it seems that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it has never carried out a secret atomic programme and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found at the site comes from the weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after the particle analysis as a mash.
Since then, damask has refused to discuss this, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow the controllers to carry out a second inspection at the el-Kibar site and refuses access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel remains stubbornly silent.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently said: 'We will never comment on this'.
Thus, the investigation of this case has been dragging on since June 2008 without a result and "more and more into a serious problem of the credibility of the Agency", as acknowledged by a high-ranking Western diplomat serving at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, it is ultimately a serious violation of the nuclear-weapon-ban treaty.
IAEA considers that, in order to make progress, the existence of the other three facilities, which must have a "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor, must be clarified.
So far, inspectors have not indicated what facilities are here, or what their function or what they are suspected to contain.
According to information published in the newspaper "Seddeutsche 'eitung", they are known within the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, respectively, also to the names of neighbouring towns.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, D.C., identified these localities and discovered in satellite images a complex near Masyaf, which would most likely be one of the suspect objects.
It is possible that it is located in a military base or directly next to it; that is exactly why Syria refuses access to the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is claimed that Syrians fear that the inspection group will in fact be spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
In fact, it is intelligence provided by American secret agents that attracts the attention of the nuclear inspectors.
IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have shuttled between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat stated in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "smpt for fuel production".
It would "no indication of sensitive activities", such as uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are essential for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly operates thanks to unenriched uranium.
However, there are rigorously plausible assumptions about the following fundamental questions: where uranium should have come from and where the plutonium needed to make the bomb would later have been separated.
It is not known whether the rubble, which could hide high-value traces, were stored at all three sites.
Once the hundreds of trucks loaded with land have disappeared, no one will have information on the place where the rubble is stored.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria has had the al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometres from al-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if it can be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
By recently analyzing satellite photos taken on behalf of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, former IAEA Inspector, Mr. Robert Kelley established a link between the reactor and the reactor in question.
Satellite photographs show, however, that Syria has undertaken earthworks at the three suspect sites and has moved huge containers when IAEA begins to require access to these locations.
It may be a coincidence, but it has not helped to dismiss suspicions.
In diplomatic circles, it was said that IAEA had spent several months preparing a plan for the inspections to be carried out there. The plan was intended to enable Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only the time invested shows the great interest of the inspectors in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also ignored this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency of the case would not be reported, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the US ambassador who has been referring to what is known as the special inspections, one of the most powerful means at the disposal of the Atomic Agency to implement its controls for some months.
The Director of the IAEA, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has certainly already spoken of 'an option to which I am open in the future', but he is still hesitating.
This means carries a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and many of the 35 countries represented there are no desire to see the situation escalate.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who gives to reflect: 'Would it be useful if in the end they find nothing'
Love in time of war
It's been bad since Angelina Jolie made her summer debut as a director.
She wrote the script herself: it is a love affair between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
Nothing more is known about this story, but that is enough to cause discomfort.
There is a persistent rumour that the woman, a Muslim woman, fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the Yugoslav war.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested. In response, some planned filming sequences in Sarajevo were moved at the last minute in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests are still continuing in Bosnia.
According to reports in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war sent correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and demanded to meet with the actress. Jolie is herself a Goodwill Ambassador to UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat. Already a few weeks ago, she offered these women a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting is to be held in Bosnia," says Hasecic.
There have been no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario speaks quite a long time about his attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that the Hasecic organization subsequently recommended that the United Nations High Commissioner's Office to withdraw the status of Goodwill Ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, by the way, what kind of scenario did she write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its script, granted a filming permit to Sarajevo after some hesitation, but it is not known why it did not come after this authorization.
The young author herself assures that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that it is by making a great deal of effort that she has become aware of the Yugoslav conflict. She argues that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of war and give everyone interested parties the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
Thus, a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It's quite different: lovers knew each other long before the war began. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serb concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is, however, a big difference from the version "a rape victim is in love with his executioner".
That Jolie's film started long before the war, of course.
The pressure exerted on it, thus expressed Jolie, is "unfair and based on erroneous information".
Now, only Hollywood fanatics can give him peace: by illegally putting this script online, like many others before.
Let's get out of here.
Tonight, everything is going well again with the Irish.
no trace of consternation.
This is why the local team overdoes visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans scream with joy at the background of loud music, they trample their feet.
Baileyu-Pub de Cork in South Ireland vibrates because players throw and manage to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters in beer cups of the opposing team.
This weird show is called "beer-pong." The winner pocketed 500 Euros plus a plane ticket to attend Las Vegas in January at the World Beer Pong Championship.
Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really don't go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the dark question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his plans. In January, he will conduct job interviews in New zealand.
"I feel strange, though," he says.
"The home country is so far away and I have no job."
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her job up as an event project manager, maybe a good sign," said the young man smiling.
Because of the bleak prospects at home, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, resides in Sydney, and her brother Colin now holds a position as a computer consultant in London.
Young people are leaving: The situation of most of the families living on the island resembles that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish people will soon leave their country.
They even plan to have 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts are realised, it will be a trend of emigration comparable to that from which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish enjoyed great ease, grief is now taking the place.
The economic crisis, however, affects above all young Irish people, who have so far had only a moment of happiness.
The loss of employment and social decay seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there was excess money.
But, in the meantime, three people in ten under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times publishes extensively the letters of readers written by young emigrants, who complain: 'In Ireland, everything is drifting.'
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever has the possibilities is going away and our country is going to a whole generation."
"The last one to leave the light goes off."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students' Union, sees a bleaker future because the government is only throwing out dust and offers no prospects for the future for young people.
'They cut minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,' says the 20-year-old student.
She sees how her classmates cling to one practical unpaid course.
She states that her greatest concern is to emigrate herself in four years' time.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to address this theme positively.
McLarnon is organising the "WorkingAbroadExpo" fair, which provides comprehensive support on the theme "Working abroad".
'But work abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy,' says the manager.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a problem, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For the past six months, Sein O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing left to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the German construction sector.
A fashion house is just out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover or Berlin projects.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visits his native country, as he participates in an additional workplace, so that he can complete the repayment of the loan taken to build his home.
'The situation is already a little crazy,' he says, crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I make money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I practically no longer live."
He bursts with embarrassed laughter as he walks through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-catt gardens, expensive cars of major brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house jointly with his sister for a total of 380,000 Euros, 100 percent funded by credit.
"These were moments of madness, no doubt, money was easy," he says.
Is he afraid that everything will collapse because of credit?
O'Donovan reflects for a moment, refreshes hot tea and says, "I have no children to maintain and I'm young; even everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The building engineer does not like the lamentations he often hears lately.
'No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is not as dramatic as we once experienced here on the island,' he argues.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst, maybe it's what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughed and then spoke of his father who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
"He was back after spending seven years there and, in Ireland, life was simply going on."
This idea pleases Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and find out how life goes elsewhere.
In his record, he already has a few years of work in London. That's why life doesn't have to be so easy for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that worries him in the last few days: the party to be organised on the occasion of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He fears that she will not be able to transform herself on a farewell evening.
"Only, not a lot of emotions," he said, drinking a long sip of beer.
"A farewell, it still seems worrisome."
"Let's call it a goodbye evening, relaxed, bringing together some friends, with a few drinks and a few games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as does the support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the US in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latino-barietro poll taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it follows changes in attitude in the region.
Two related elements emerge from this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the Pacific of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a sharp decline in output last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase over 25% in 2001 (Graph 3).
Some 34% said that they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but a sharp increase from 17% and 24 per cent, respectively.
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America shattered support for democracy.
If this was a good conclusion during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in the America have suffered only a brief recession and have benefited from a sharp recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and declined again this year to 32 per cent.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sentiment of progress
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and violent crime has worsened.
This is only the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see table 5).
About 31 per cent say that they or one of their relatives have been the victim of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure is lower than in the 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the increase in support of private enterprise and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared to 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their developed country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela agree (and 80% support private enterprise); even though their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the biggest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% since last year).
However, the United States is considered to be the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A defied vote
No one expected to have a perfect general election in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country affected and be plunged into fear.
Bankruptcy boxes and a new ballot, scattered drop-out ballots, ransacked polling stations and intimidation were presented
The polling stations opened late at night.
Many Hatgans, including many who were displaced as a result of the January earthquake, were wandering around the neighborhood to find a place to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favourites, denounced the fraud and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in the United Nations in Haiti, sees the event as "a fairly good election in many ways".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they "do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, an unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former late lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared invalid.
But there may be problems if Mr. Ceestin, who has little or no perceptible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second toath the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, there were concerns that participation would be.
In this case, many hemans wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, required to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The stakes are high.
Donors see the election of a people's and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it's clear, Haitians do it themselves.
Pointing of the feet towards the centre
The weeks after suddenly becoming a widow, Argentina's president Cristina Fernandez received a wave of public sympathy that improved its approval rate by 20 points to more than 50 percent; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on Ms. Fernandez’s choice, which is visibly to mourning, that she would abandon or not abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to draw up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the additional income at will.
Mrs Fernandez's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has sunk into disarray following the death of Mr. Kirchner of a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement joined Ms. Fernandez.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian struck one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress did not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the President even more room for spending at will.
The economy is overheating: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation is now 11.1 per cent, but many private estimates and wage demands of the trade unions see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority, rather than controlling inflation.
It refused to deal with IMF, harassed the private sector and purged INDEC, the statistical office, which falsified official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernandez now moderate these policies?
It called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been stimulated by high world prices for Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded growth spurred the push following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why she is showing signs of wanting to re-establish Argentina's financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders that had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt for which Argentina had not settled its dues in 2001.
Now Ms Fernandez seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments groupd in the Paris Club, to which it owes some .
The Kirchners have always insisted that it could not involve surveillance by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of the Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which resembles a prelude to the consolidation of INDEC.
It is not clear whether Mrs Fernandez wants to stay in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer with her side.
If it does, it needs to gain middle-class support, among which kirchnerism is highly advocated.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for it will have flowed back.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, without noise, many of her husband’s policies.
Half a hurrah for China
Taiwanese voters are moving towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its older brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters appeared on November 27, or 70% of eligible, to elect mayors and councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself became a substitute for feelings in relation to the continent, having forged innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China proper since 1949.
Mr. My success in the test, but just.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five town halls, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic-Progressive Party (DPP), which leaned towards full Taiwan’s independence, won nearly 50% of all votes for the KMT 45%.
If it had been a presidential election, Mr. I would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's share of voting has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT to the municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including crashy country trucks and mass gathering flags with girls dancing in minimal dance.
A mandatory mysterious assassination attempt was also carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of KMT, toured an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot at the young man. Link, purely through the face, injuring him and killing a bystander.
Oddly enough, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Link or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had an impact on the election by leading suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the elections was China.
It was striking how absent the issue of the mainland itself was.
Instead, the candidates have played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from stirring up anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation as to whether his policy on China was acceptable to the majority of Taiwanese.
The Beijing government can be expected to continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to deceive Taiwan, back into the fold.
China has wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let us start at the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, he was in bad shape: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison following accusations of corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008 he was a provocateur for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is making every effort to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that it, too, can engage with Beijing.
Ms Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their discussions could take place without preconditions.
Ms Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party had a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma about China.
Mr. Chen seems to be exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. So, a pragmatic, not to run for the presidency.
Even without the intervention of Mr. Chen, the DPP will find it difficult to choose between its potential candidates.
The KMT must introspect yourself.
Mr. Ma were weak; despite dizzying economic growth, the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and widening the gap between rich and poor.
A spokesman for KMT said that his cabinet and local offices would be redesigned.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan’s support for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Nominations at the Grammy Awards: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the "Best New Artist" category
Carry out at the request of a president, and people are required to read it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer hand-picked by President Obama to perform at her 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the Grammy Awards' surprises this year with a grand nomination in the category of "Best New Artist".
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains a bit mysterious but it is compatible with the Grammy Award rules that an artist must not release more than three albums before recording; which "establishes the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skillful hand of pop and funk and Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one dotted line at Spalding compared to the rapid success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for the Grammy Awards voters.
Elsewhere, Grammy Award voters have rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "instrumental album" category, a ride on a refreshing thrill of a recording that was one of the prime favorites last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" of veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the keyboardist John Beasley will compete.
Trombone Shorty, a New Orleans hoarse vocal vocalist and a frequent guest at HBO's "Treme", has been honored in the contemporary jazz category; who also strongly bows into a certain fusion with Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of the savage Darcy James Argue, familiar with steampunk, gained some well-deserved recognition in the grand ensemble category; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland of which the album "Pathways" of his live byte was a fine example of the democratic hand of this bassist as a leader.
Grammy nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers from around the world.
At the top of the nominations are "Deus Ex Machina" by Michael Daugherty, for the piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and "Dreamhouse" by Steve Mackey, an electrical orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Port for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Los Angeles-based composer's Madolin Concerto, Avner Dorman, is also in the running for a award.
The classic nominations are spread over 13 categories covering recordings of orchestra, opera, chorale and solo recordings.
A classic producer of the Year category features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classical album are Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Daugherty's Nashville Symphony Orchestra Orchestra's "Dreamhouse" by Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals;by Verdi of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse of Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" by Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by RoyricaIvanhoe" by Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for Contemporary Composition count for Symbol 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
The No. 4 Symphony of Port had its premiere at Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his instrumental performance soloist with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he wrote the 15-minute work especially for the mandolin performer Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using Middle Eastern sounds and a large number of North African scales and rhythms," Dorman said in a phone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received an appointment in the category of conducting performances, for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received an appointment were pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year there are only nominee vocalists-soloists; here they are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonova, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mixing category, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Roots: My Life, My Song"
The Temecula Mosque project wins approval from the Planning Commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, which was often passionate.
Critics attacked the project by claiming that it was promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the Commissioners ruled on Wednesday evening that the new religious center respected local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to support him: Christians, Jews, Baha'is, you mention it", said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre in Temecula Valley, speaking on Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of that, as an American citizen."
"This shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal", he added.
"They just have very loud voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session started at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people pronouncing for or against the centre, at roughly evenly distributed speaking time, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no longer an American," one speaker wrote.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres have also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including the ground zero, the site of the attacks of 11 September 2001, in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Its congregation of 135 families has coexisted without incident in Riverside County for years, but it wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse it rented on a shared property with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new 24.943 square foot mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and would rise 43 feet high.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the Nicolas road about two miles east of the High School Chaparral.
Opponents can still appeal against the municipal council against this project.
An arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although the researchers discovered the unusual bacterium here on Earth, they say this shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That's why it's very special, even though it's far from being a really 'foreign' form of life," commented Paul Davies C. W. of the Arizona State University, co-author of the report in the Science newspaper's Thursday online edition.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But the researchers found that the bacterium, discovered in Lake Mono, California, is able to continue growing after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We wonder what's still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
Discovery is important when looking for life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not divulge the details of the find, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report might divulge the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This was not the case.
The discovery 'shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms may be able to use other elements to actuate biochemistry and that the 'standard' set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, may not be fixed,' commented Charles Cockell, Professor at the Institute of Planetary and Space Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
'This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure,' added Cockell.
It was not a fortuitous discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Institute of Astrology, which led the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; for example, it has speculated that a microbe exposed to the two substances may be able to substitute for each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
'As a result, it is difficult for agencies to distinguish these elements separately.'
'But arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it gets inside and, somehow, erases the work of our biochemical machine,' explained Anbar.
Researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that an arsenic-using life form may occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing ever showed that it could work.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of the Earth's existence; she says; for example, researchers hypothesized that early life could have used it.
This suggests that there might be other ways to form life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning,' said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exposure dogs were found in Compton
The other two exhibition dogs on four stolen from outside a motel at Bellflower were found, and the Los Angeles County sheriffs bored on Thursday.
The four exposure dogs - two akitas and two Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower motel 6, the authorities announced.
Two of the dogs were recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late in the evening of Wednesday, said to Steve Whitmore, the spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are fine," said Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They have been returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in which neighborhood and what the circumstances of their discovery were.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We're following orders."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were reunited on Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas at an animal shelter in the county in Downey.
The sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were safe, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show in regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were missing until they were discovered on Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the long Beach national championship "AKC/Eukanuba", where they intended to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events planned in the days leading up to the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops of the couple's almost a month-long canine exhibition tour.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their vans outside, right next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell burrow and Breton's spaniel - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Aktas and the corgis, with the thicker fur, in the van where it would be fresher.
They opened the windows a little bit, so that the dogs could look fresh.
Peek and Rickard reported the van flight at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could take them to corgis, with an implanted microchip to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM is waiting for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start from scratch.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York City officially leased on Thursday the “pre-packed” plan by creditors that about 5 billion dollars of debt would be forgiven; paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus on the production and distribution of films and television shows.
With Thursday's decision that the plan meets the requirements of the United States Bankruptcy Code, there are no legal impediments to MGM to return to the trusteeship of Entertainment Spyglass founders, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the general managers of what will be a light studio.
Staff will be reduced to approximately 320 out of 400 at the outset.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has concluded a USD 500 million credit facility to finance the new operations and productions of GMM.
It is currently being licensed by the investment bank, which is facing USD 75 million and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The process of restructuring the studio began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to advise management on how to place its finances, as it could not afford to pay interest on the amount of USD 300 million per year.
In August, general manager Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the studio took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were prepared to pay the sum of 2 billion more from which the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, it was necessary to do everything possible again as the MGM team began work on a restructuring plan which, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially exits bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper receive multi-million-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received a total of 1.2 million dollars, will receive a payment of 9.5 million dollars.
Cooper's companies, which have raised EUR 375,000 per month for their management services of the company, will receive a "success bonus" of 4 million dollars.
Barber and Birnbaum intend to relaunch the production of MGM, which has released only one film this year, and to set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released in 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit", starring Warner Bros.
The studio had to make a separate loan between 265,000,000 and 275 million dollars to finance its share in both films, which were to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget balanced
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful toy is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make an important gap in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for 99 dollars and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic pearl jump strings, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholesale Club from BJ - to see the electronic toys that I could buy for less than 80 dollars.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's tech toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the best-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button cell toys are increasing, as are rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 for 3 years and more) are teddy bear toys the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when you press them on your stomach.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second one allows a song to be composed.
If you buy several of them, they will sing in harmony.
Be careful: once you start pressing, you can't stop.
To combine singing with dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, 60 dollars for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-based games like Simon Says and can do the lunar dance with its innovative articulated feet with wheel locking.
The children who have worn the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the '80s, you'll remember Alphia, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro/Playyskool, 40 dollars for 3 years and more), with a backpack filled with carded game cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with self-correction and valve filing.
If you're suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three stand-alone alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo (60, for 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games do not educate as efficiently as the Explorer Leapster (70 dollars, for 3 to 12 years), it is the first major revision of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL uses an iTunes-like system to offer games and e-books and has an SD card entry that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and over) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a matchbox, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time elapses, it's ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child from a Club Penguin online pet, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, 5 dollars, for 6 to 12 years old) that includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives enough credits from the Club Penguin store for two items of choice.
These may be roller skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (more than 10, for 5 years and over) is the last button cell microrobots.
The fake bug moves rapidly over 12 vibrating silicone pasta in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also strong.
Ours withstood a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage through our dog's mouth.
Bringing a softer side to law enforcement in China
Tang Shenbin wandered a place in the city like an urban sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nerve charges, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted female members of chengguan -- responsible for public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and their inclination to violence -- convey a certain impression to a range of spectators.
"Hold right."
"Be piercing."
Show them, he said, "what do pretty girls look like?"
Four girls who barely spent adolescence in white gloves, dressed in olive-coloured jackets and identical trousers, froze at the guard.
Four pairs of black heel shoes aligned with the ruler.
Four neat hats perfectly perched at the top of hair attached by a striped knot in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with disdain.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city demanded that all new recruits have a higher education degree.
Guangdong province traded the grey-green of the uniforms for a supposedly more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the lower-eyes with the strong way: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had encircled a uncontrollable snack cart by throwing black glances, firmly for half an hour, until the spedback was repackaging and leaving.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose to do a major image operation.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its urban street police with 13 women, specially selected for their appearance, curdy and young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson may have difficulty lingering China’s underground urban brigade.
And for good reason, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media are portraying news of a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors from Hubei province beat an observer to death after he used his cell phone to film them in the process of dispersing a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and uploaded, described how to effectively defeat offenders without emitting blood.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon pedag pedcher was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A violent video game, available for download online, shows Chinese inspectors trained to assault street vendors.
"Chengguan marked the government," Lamented China Daily, a national publication, after yet another polemic about tactics.
The newspaper called for a "genuine complete cleaning."
Skeptics say that the approach is a long way off.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered whether women had real tasks or whether they were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little of both.
The district announcement required women candidates, aged between 18 and 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five facial features in the right order."
They must be above the average size of 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
The officers stated that the work was physically too painful for women over the age of 25.
"It is their image that is important," a certain district officer told Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are suitable; it is the size, the weight, the facial lines, etc."
Then come the temperament and the "inner qualities."
The women of Chengguan are like flowering vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, Mr. Lihua, does not agree with this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement for the order of the facial lines.
What it means beautiful is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, disabled or disfigured persons should not apply.
'We cannot let a person who can and from a hunch or a hunch is to serve here,' says Mr. Mr. zheng.
"It wouldn't give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has apple cheeks with a finely curved mouth.
She did not consider her appearance to be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked for a disillusioned air.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old dimple colleague, said, "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They do not oppose the limited mandate of their mandate, they said, because they have greater career ambitions than simply driving out vendors in the alleys where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team confronts a dozen street vendors who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many buns or bowls of tofu as possible before fleeing.
"Master Wang, you must go."
"We have already told you several times," said Mrs Xu, as a salesman ran away on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle bike.
The agents describe their functions rather as monotonous and ardent.
"It's pretty much the same thing every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who is studying marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate sellers' assets.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exhibitions of animosity against the bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after the spread of false rumours that chengguan agents had killed a vendor.
In one night, more than a dozen police and chengguan officers were injured, 14 Government vehicles were overthrown or ignited.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the placid Baoguang square, where female officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
The agents confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a shop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike was shouting scandal.
A 15-minute standoff followed before the sinister-faced policemen made their way to their vehicle and left at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, stayed behind, his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 or over - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
'Sometimes we fight physically,' said Mr. Li said in a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it's the audience that starts."
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Department of Justice prosecutors lifted the criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, arising from a case related to an assistant to an old campaign and his efforts to obtain lobbying work for the wife's husband, the senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
The decision puts an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate from 2012 until the scandal surrounding his case did the headlines last year and harm his career.
Mr. Ensign stated that he was "very happy" by the decision, the result of a one-year investigation.
The Senator could still be exposed to disciplinary action taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign stated that the Department of Justice "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer under investigation and that he had no intention of holding any charges against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice has refrained from commenting on this matter.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice that there is significant evidence that Mr. Ensign is said to have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in The New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain lucrative lobbying to win Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the Senator's case with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as treasurer in an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby them; in accordance with documents and interviews.
Given that Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for one year by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
The ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems to be at odds with the so-called ban on the revolving door of lobbying.
According to the evidence that has been made public, "there seems to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and materially violate the Revolving Door Act," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients from a government investigation.
Although the judge of the Ministry refused to explain the reasoning leading to the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the ministry seemed to be wary of political prosecutions after a number of high-level setbacks by its Public Integrity Section, including last year's decisions to drop the case against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of prosecution.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the Citizen's Director General for Accountability and Ethics in Washington, D.C., a advocacy group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This essentially says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them", she added.
Paul Coggins, Senior Counsel for Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call from a prosecutor from the Ministry of Justice on Monday and a follow-up the next day, telling him that the ministry was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign had cooperated with prosecutors in trying to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed on Wednesday in a statement, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify his legal arguments to the Public Prosecutor's Office.
'I am not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision,' he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to drop an investigation into an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the payment of EUR 96 000 by Mr. Ensign to the Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The election commission stated that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign assisted Mr. Hampton to find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company hosted Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Insignia, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and he told him that he was "marking" the Home Ministry on a matter in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also participated in a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and requested the Secretary of Transportation to set a meeting on behalf of the airline after engaging Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When the news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to run for a third term in the Senate.
Announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the Ministry of Justice's example and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were typing away in the rows of the courtroom.
They sent terrible testimonial reports every minute via Twitter.
In the end, the defence said that there were more than 140,000 messages about the rape case trial and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the trial largely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to result in an official ending in which the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes had already filed evidence in court that outlined appellate arguments, which could occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial – as well as the widespread and widespread use of Twitter journalists – have created a "circus atmosphere," such a widespread and instant saturation with inflammatory details that the jury was poorly influenced by public passions.
The request could prompt appellate judges to discuss whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I experienced this in this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in courtrooms violates human rights in a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer for Mr. Hayes, Chief Advocate.
Judge of the trial, Jon C. Blue of the State Superior Court, laconically rejected the claims in last week's judgement, claiming that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was animated by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
Courts of appeal have for decades recognized that media coverage of well-known cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 trial, the United States Supreme Court quashed the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers stated that the courts of appeal to review Mr. Hayes may be curious given the argument that new rules might be needed to manage the media in courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that she was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue argues that some appellate judges may be intrigued by the idea that limiting instantaneous communication from courtrooms could lead to fairer trials.
The case of Twitter is just one of many others described by Mr. Hayes, which could be discussed for years; this delays execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes reportedly suffered harm when Justice Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photographs of criminal scenes at the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors stated that they had been horrified by the victims' photos, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defence lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical of prosecutors, and that he improperly put pressure on a verdict by taking the unusual decision to get the jury to deliberate within a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But their arguments on the effect of intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was being discussed during the election campaign by candidates for Governor and the United States Senate.
They maintained that the computer media were constantly stirring up the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily hustle and bustle of media tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "didn't look like anything that had been seen here before, in New Haven, and maybe even nationally."
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the statement that the snapshots were more incendiary than the reported that were postponed was a luddist view that would impoverish the Court's policy of media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers have stated that courts of appeal are often attracted by arguments that social and technological changes require adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that overthrew Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of media coverage of the trial and clarified that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century. "
Can civility bring divisions closer together?
After a campaign of invective and negativity, a modicum of civility erupted in Washington this week.
Is this a harbinger of genuine forward forward bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before the rapid return to partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no breakthroughs on the major issues that need to be addressed during the "laudy duck" session.
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two sides as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points.
Wednesday's public meeting of the committee on the President's deficit was just as civilised, despite the remaining political differences between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap; but which, however, still divides the members.
It is barely enough to declare a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a period of trial and mutual testing with a view to obtaining signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
For this reason, Tuesday's meeting and subsequent comments from participants revealed a minimum of demands or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it is taxation, expenditure, health care or rights, both parties remain miles away.
Yet the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed in the tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now next to the Center for Ethical and Public Policy.
"This is inevitable after the elections.
The elections are a source of partisan and then fading.
That's good."
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the "lush duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of them, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is conceivable on extending unemployment benefits, if only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while at the same time denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism is hanging out for possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on "laughing duck", with the ratification of the New START pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warned that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "Duck" session did not necessarily lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress met in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
'Once the things that need to be done are, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations,' he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared scepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what happens between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow boxing compared to the main event of 2012, he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and to the tea voters who contributed to its creation.
But Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to live up to their promises to cut public spending and repeal the new health-care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the initial reactions to the deficit committee's recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, raising the retirement age and reducing spending.
Co-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in themselves, imposed the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to make their plan as a formal recommendation, and they have found it difficult to reach that number.
There is still the greatest resistance among the elected representatives of the group, which suggests that there are on tax issues, at least today, few motives or willingness to compromise.
Galston planned two phases in the fighting between the White House and the congressional Republicans.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan confrontations, given that Republicans challenge Obama in terms of budget, taxes, and health care; and then followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
Public opinion.
There is ample evidence that, despite the spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a stalemate, as in 1995, then both parties will closely observe the public reaction.
Anyone who is deemed to be losing will have to change course and find compromises.
But that would be an optimistic view.
The partisan mind and polarization are bigger today than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and congressional Republicans than there were between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a larger election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked American documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleopocy" and passes some of the bribes and protective money it collects, the US embassy in Russia in a note in February passed.
The police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate companies but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the 'vertical of power' - is doing its part as the money moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington as Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on its website on Wednesday by Wikileaks.
The note is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there has since been little clean-up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied the corruption charges over the years; and he won several defamation suits on these charges.
In September, he said the following to a Russian television channel, when he was asked about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's to throw away, it's nonsense."
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information set out in an embassy report; and it is unwise to conceive that it would be up to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow City government and crime led some people to call it "functional dyss" and to assert that the government worked more as a kleptocy than a government," according to the embassy's note.
"The criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (term used in the criminal world/mafia which literally means 'roof' or protection) which passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as throughout the bureaucracy of the Moscow City government.
"Analysts to identify a three-tier structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are at the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
'This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a gap in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services.'
The report states that the FSB is brewing money from the largest companies and that the police target the small ones.
A source, he said, "explained that business owners in Moscow understood that it was better to obtain protection from the MVD and the FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law. "
"This is why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high."
The note states that, although the collection of money is extended, the protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their affairs closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev spoke several times about the fight against corruption, but admitted the lack of progress.
The embassy's memo sends reports of men who bring suitcases, probably full of money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats," said Gueorgui Satarov, director of the "think tank Indiam" in Moscow.
"But it's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because there are none in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indian, the costs of corruption would amount to more than 300 billion dollars a year at the entire scale of the Russian Federation.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked at least to the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the note from the US embassy, which was only realized yesterday, late in the evening of Moscow, will stir with certainty the discontent within the Russian government; although Luzhkov may be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow’s failures, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin speculated that WikiLeaks documents could be fabrication and reacted angrily to the statements that US diplomats had leaked by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
'The problem is that this is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country,' he says.
"But to be honest with you, we didn't suspect that it would be achieved with such arrogance, such pressure and, as you know, in opposition to ethics."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In an ill-lit classroom with poor quality decrepit concrete walls, the headmaster of the Anlong Veng High School spoke about the man who built it, the last head of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as the "butcher" for his brutality, when he led the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated stronghold of former Khmer Rouge in north-western Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum enabled victims to publicly confront the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual there, which for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led with the United Nations, handed down its first sentence concerning a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the former leader of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture centre to 35 years'imprisonment, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the "Duch".
In the face of these developments, anxiety has increased among Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Resource Center, an independent body that is conducting research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
During the Khmer Rouge reign in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrowd the US government of Pol Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to Cambodia’s border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurgency that lasted until the last of the movements went in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were leading the guerrillas from their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a sequel to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a United Nations-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge combatants began defecting the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had stood up, was captured by Government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 pending trial.
Without their benefactors, most Khmer Rouge veterans have fallen into abject poverty, common to Cambodia's rural areas; and many remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although some elite Khmer Rouge officers kept their local leadership positions in exchange for laying down their arms, they are unskilled low-grade and record farmers.
"These people received very little follow-up after the capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are soaked in the regime's agrarian utopian ideology."
"They were brought up in a setting where doing business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling down in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is hard because we have to support ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge court has also caused concern here.
Early next year, the court is expected to begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer minister Rouge.
The Tribunal's mandate is to try senior leaders and perpetrators, but it did not say whether it continued beyond these four cases.
It would take more to allay fears at Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation turned to Im Chaem, aged 64, a former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced labourers were reportedly killed.
Recently, on a hot evening, Im Chaem came back from the field work near his wooden house on stilts, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows over the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned it, it said, it would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable", she said.
"If there is more prosecution, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court continued several suspects; although experts and historians disputed this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confronting the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang of the documentation center.
"The reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect the broken pieces," he said.
"We have to put these pieces together so that we can understand."
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, "A 75-page story of democratic Kampuchea."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history textbooks of the Ministry of Education, designed for college schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he came back with the book at home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he says.
"They're wary because they don't know exactly how many people the court will go on."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful appeal here.
In the heights of the mountains of Dangrek, a path, invaded by weeds and dotted with plastic bags, leads to a black soot rectangle, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
31-year-old Nuom Sothea, a mobile phone saleswoman at the roadside, said that she didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a great spirit; and many inhabitants go there to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she planned to walk to Pol Pot's last resting place where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to forego stockpile of military-grade uranium
The government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this is part of a surprise victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide.
The deal was leaked in a joint communiqué issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The US government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But US officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been conducted with Belarus in the last two months to remove 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a research center in Belarus.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the subject by about 500 pounds, according to a staff member who raised the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the initiative of Obama, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was profitable to obtain an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit Security Summit."
"This proves to me that this process works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear security advocacy group.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" made by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world within the next four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that the nation would never give up its uranium.
'We kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-grade uranium and low-enriched uranium,' said Mr. Lukashenko.
"This is our product... We're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
'We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all.'
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago; however, by expressing an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to dispose of uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated as the equipment had been slightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and eliminated, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was conducted by air, according to officials.
The US government has spent USD 13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus's research facilities with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"Fictimate coordination and organisation have been implemented to build confidence"; thus leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the Energy Department specialising in the Reduction of the Global Threat.
According to estimates by the James Martin Non-Proliferation Study Center, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of kilos of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to phase out its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential renewal.
"While welcoming the progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains essential for improving bilateral relations; and essential for the progress of the country and its citizens", she said.
The government has no objection to CIA flights
The government has raised no objections to CIA flights with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda to Guantanamo Bay across Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the United States Ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks on the daily newspaper El Pais, which add that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time, Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed that they would be able to demonstrate that they were exercising adequate vigilance over foreign aircraft crossing Spain.
In June 2006, after a Council of Europe report accusing a human rights-free practice of a dozen countries, including Spain, was held between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernandez de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "suspected the Government of zapatero off the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to the flights of intelligence over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to prevent them from being "prevented", says Aguirre in a cable.
The incumbent of the Ministry of Externalhood of that time, Miguel Angel Moratinos, informed the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wants to give this case the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity for influence".
In January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez handed over to the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information", explained the Embassy after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless shown its concern for the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors" more than for the declassified information of CNI o of the Ministry of Defence.
'This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to manoeuvre the case discreetly between Governments,' Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007 during a lunch between the US Ambassador and the Minister of Internal, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even though the Spanish judges are madly jealous of his independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators "to avoid the comments of inflamed rhetoric, trying to re-up the temperature".
The Ambassador also expresses his concern for the action of the PP in this case.
"Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored United States actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the United States Government," she said.
The parricide who confessed was a network of "overwhelming" of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Gift to Galician"
Juanatey Fernandez is "Muki" in the network.
With the nickname she used as soon as she was a child, communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; the two from Noia, the village of Corua from which she came.
The messages are from 2008.
To hear them, you need to know your sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of its parents' testimonies.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had initiated a relationship in 1998 with industrial Ivon Toez.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Soon after they separated, it was known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend soon after that.
The elected representative was Alberto, a man of Lousama, a neighboring municipe.
With him, she cohabited for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labour market, the child stayed with her partner, who even accompanied him for a week in Palma.
But depending on the content of his communications, it is heard that their idyll has broken himself, they have separated.
In March 2008 she was in Menorca alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and upset for the fact that I came to work there."
"When I told him, it seemed to him a good thing, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she talks about a mobile message that she just got: "I want you to come home this month or you give me an address to send you the child."
She complains: 'If she doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take him when I go home,' she alludes.
In May, she talks about the re-entry at her village: "This week I'm leaving, but I'll only stay there until 19, because on the 20th I have to go to a workstation so I don't lose it."
She explains that if all was well, she would have taken her eldest time with her.
"It will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him in my life with another person if that person is not my mother," doubtful intention, taking into account their bad relationship.
In July, there's another post.
When she hits it, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and he was supposedly murdered on the 10th, died.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but he's not happy with another."
"On one side he's with me and he likes this place a little, but on another another he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a trip to Majorca.
"There will be (the child) there at a few summer hours and so I save a little bit of babysitter money."
17, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to email, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, another: "The child is well, and goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On his current partner, he says: 'He brings me money'.
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of hers in the now blocked MySpace universe, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"Galician's error (altographer)".
The last man who lived with her, a vigil, declares his regret at feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything had passed so that she didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
Yesterday, he joined the Palma Provincial Prison, from the Menorca Judicial Detention Centre.
The ex officio lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she does not remember how the facts went, "and she also had no intention of harming the minor".
Before she had confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and lay down her corpse in a suitcase.
The defence and the prosecutor sought a psychiatric test.
Members of the People's Party would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipes of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the large increase in votes and Members in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the outlook is more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation normally duplicates the one it receives in the Catalan.
For example, the Catalan people obtained 610,473 votes in the generals of 2008, while in the autonomous countries of 316.222.
Last Sunday, the CPP received 384.091 votes.
If this upward trend, desired to misappropriate the votes of the SGP and the retention of the PP electorate, the analysts of this group have calculated that, if there are general elections, the CPP could have increased from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (it now has 10) and PSC would lose no more than 9 deputies (he has 25).
These calculations would find that Catalan space is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the people's analysis, ERC would lose a Member - it has three now - while ICV would keep a Member or win one.
But if the electoral agenda is maintained, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for municipal comics, where the populars can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their back at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and the people agree that PSC could lose the town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would no longer obtain the possibility of using their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the republican debacle, it would not be fanciful if this formation lost its representation in the Barcelona City Council - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes -.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes against PSC, including the mayor, Àngel Ros, maintained a very good relationship with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
Popular people have also made progress in other important municipes such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
The PP is now present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
Catalan cell facilitated thousands of Al Qaeda passports
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistani and Nigerians detained by agents of the Barcelona Police General Police Office formed a jihadist cell which, headquartered in Thailand, facilitated passports to various AlQaida groups, between which "The Tigers for the Liberation of Tamil Earth" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last being the perpetrator of the Bombay attacks.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that, with the "Operation Kampai" has been "debilitated" the international falsification apparatus of Al Qaeda and "therefore its operational capacity".
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that included the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" could cross European and other Western borders with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, which is why, in the investigations, apart from the Thai services, participated other European police units, so in the territory of the European Union there could be shots similar to the days after the night of the Tuesday spent in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Niger Babatunde Agunbiade was detained), in Thailand, with the capture of the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and the Pakistani Mensan.
They were the ones who ran the cell from Bangkok in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stolen from tourists the passports that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is to say, the documents were to be in the name of young men between the ages of 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The investigators point out that so far no details have been found to connect the detainees in Catalonia with the attack in Bombay, even though the perpetrator of the attack, "Laskar e Taiba", has been one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that a few days before the attack was carried out in Catalonia, a few miles of transfers were sent through a transfer agency, which were "invested" to buy mobile cards which were subsequently used by the "commando" which killed 106 people.
The police took up extensive documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
PPC leader Alicia Sanchez-Camacho yesterday had the opportunity to personally expose Artur Mas his terms to support his inauguration as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exhibited during the campaign and summed up to giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-Sovereignist adventures as the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to address in his term.
The President of the Catalan people came to the rendezvous with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the parties that the opposition will abstain in the vote of the nomination.
A possible understanding with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general election, but, for the time being, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are taking place as a Catalan key.
And as far as the PP president is concerned, in support of an inauguration “all sovereignist and pro-independence speeches” and the economic complicity – similar to that of the Basque Country – that the converging leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bet to make the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomic administration and eliminate the tax on successions and donations.
Details of the negotiations on the inauguration of Mas will take care of the PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcers (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the deaths were not due to the "lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot centre do not eliminate the possibility that their nurse at night has killed more than 11 elderly people
The geriatrics La Caritat d'Olot (Gerona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least 11 elderly people for whom he was responsible in the meantime that he worked on it.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, came together by the centre's lawyer, Joan Caiada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the person responsible" for the dead, but "lawyency and accountability compel us to assume the procedural situation of civilian officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for failing to detect the criminal activities of the night nurse in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the victims'parents are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from that day he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of geriatrics - he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally investigated the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures cannot have been the cause of what happened at any time".
The lawyer for La Caritat added that "in this case there is only an indication of imprudence on the part of any person other than the accused".
The person already baptized as the "Angel of Death" confessed 11 murders the day before yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused him death by injecting him with a sober dose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pellets.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control the access of the centre's staff to medicine.
Insulin injections and the sedative cocktail had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to relieve the suffering of the interns, used to kill them.
But laboratory tests will clarify whether Vila is not lying that he has sought a less cruel or contrary death for his first victims he burned them inside, giving them laundry as he has already confessed that he has done with the three women he killed in the meantime 12-17.
Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor does the number of attempted murders, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number being greater and justify their attitude by the various versions that Vila gave in her visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change of the way in which the killing after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of the courts to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threatens
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet's threat, which warned that "markets should not underestimate our responsiveness".
Peripheral differentials have closed to strength and the shares of European banks have suffered more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to be wrong, and the euro has barely recorded an increment, which is a anxious signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that collapses in the same way as it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by fences of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will soon lose fear.
A month ago, ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
Bundesbank called for the finalisation of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures over time and leaving only unlimited access per week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly unlimited access auction at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that the bond purchase programme will continue and that it will even be given a signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, which God is helping us.
Just as during their meeting in May in which they claimed that they had not even considered the purchase of bonds and they collapsed markets, history could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing another collapse in the market.
Yesterday the one-year auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 5.28% to 5.28% compared to 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the guys in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, and clearly reflected a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the figures from the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The estimated figures amount to EUR 10 000 million in the short term and 15,000 potential and they have a deadline until February for private capital or they will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumed in the Assistance Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and does not yet have sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a hotbed of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the anthem of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the Autonomous Communities and Financial Entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment are sounding to investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The dual effect Trichet and P explains the fact that the Spanish stock exchange has suffered the 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and radical, and we enjoy the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will be enjoyed by the Trichet effect, and we therefore hope that Trichet will resolve itself with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to request an Assistance Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in available liquidity, three times compared to March, to very expensive types and they cut off access to sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "other than to be, to appear".
Courage, we can get away with it.
Eulen's president will challenge the advice of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Alvarez, the founder of the group, will contest, because he considers it "no de droit", the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, asked by five of his seven sons in whom they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons Jesus David and Maria José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for control of one part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company business service does not appear to be willing to give in his dispute to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
From its board of directors it was excluded by five of its seven sons who appointed themselves directors in the shareholders' meeting of 18 January this year, the challenge of which is registered in the Trade and Companies Register.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Madrid Commercial Magistrate No. 2, again opened the box of thunder within the Alvarez family.
The recourse to the judge in order to determine the assembly is, until the dispute resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The latest movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Alvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Alvarez as a "desperate recourse to the applicants of his five sons to try, through a procedural trick, clearly defrauding the law and abusing the law, to validate and correct the assembly radically null and void on 18 January", according to his official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for the assembly to be challenged as the assembly, assuming that it is "one's right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Alvarez's sons control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group nevertheless solicits usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This case is the question of substance that the judge must decide after the hearing on the request for a challenge for which there is not yet a date reported.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software creates improvements on real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula One in 2004, his history in this select universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
In a first moment, no one took into account the options of a new stable that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, the last November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on Fernando Alonso's Ferrari triumph.
Without lowering the skill as the champion's driver, the German Sebastien Vette, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula One, we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens company took Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
It is in fact a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives far removed from high-speed motors.
Named PLM, this powerful computing instrument was used to create assembly lines of factory manufacturers from around the world, energy stations, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or the process before constructing it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computing instrument in its Formula One plant enabled Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during races and trials.
Russwurm explained that the 1992 teams had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team now work 180 high-quality young professionals who, with powerful computer equipment, analyse and project all sorts of modifications on the cars.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all elements of Red Bull's cars except the engine, which is Renault's sole responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features are modified.
Changes can shift from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser and high-tech autoclave production systems.
As a single limitation of this madness of technology development is the amount of 40 million dollars that each Formula One team can spend as a boundary each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull set up the high-tech plant to create and produce its cars in a locality 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered a top secret.
The staff for this duty numbered 580 people, including two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The Red Bull Formula One hero, arguably, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists whose activity is invaluable and the notoriety of no value.
The factory's chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that the progress of racing cars brought 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and the technology represents 85% of success, while pilots bring the 15% of added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computers, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two 20 clean stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first in the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will count this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the renovated shop located on the Gran Via de Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been working for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to establish 200 branded outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish companies.
The first of which were opened were those in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, although she confessed that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM personal systems assured that the philosophy for the location of the shops will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and manages the design of the exclusive furniture of the shops (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will take the same picture.
In addition, HP covers the training of staff in institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and pointed out that the exclusive network of shops claims to 'improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in buying, assisting, post-sales and even packaging'.
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering pilot programme at world level that solves the possible problems of HP's computer equipment as a guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
'This system is designed specifically for MEPs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services,' noted Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'stove' a million customers to rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell’s managing director Jaime Guardiola believes that 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects another liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Despite this, it provides for a collapse in interest margins, which will be used to compensate in part with increments of commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell is expected to capture a million individual customers in three years' time, its task.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit for the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will set in motion in 2011 a new master plan which will have a three-year potential.
The aim, apart from surviving without the need to use FROB's public subsidies, is to gain a market rating by the capture of one million new private customers - 700,000 if we deduce those who can leave the bank-- its great task to accomplish, because until now this bank had spoiled more SMEs and companies than the individual customer.
This year it has captured 250,000 retail customers and 50,000 companies.
Its retail market rating is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the bet on productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as a target, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when presenting the results of the exercise.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, because the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its Optima Master Plan, established four years ago, even though initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for another year.
Clients who allow savings banks to escape will be its main objective.
During a breakfast organised by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain will be "slow".
Moreover, in two or three years' time it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the passive war – which penalizes margins – is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and funds pay for its issues to obtain liquidity are already moving at the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The liquidity and financing aspect is structural and will be a factor in pressure on credit."
"We didn't squeeze the tap, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit credit in the long term and increase the price of differentials - see CincoD-as on 22 and 27 November -.
He also admitted that the current trend in the banking sector is "to increase fees", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain 'larger dimensions will be solicited.'
"Will will change next year," he said.
He claims that capital requirements "get a huge increase" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
He mentioned that FROB could replace the market in capturing funds in the case of new recapitalisations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the time-bound of markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some banks are already predicting as a new liquidity crisis.
He pointed out that it was not possible to issue, but unlike what happened in June, short-term funding could be obtained through rest, which alleviated the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the funds
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and again stressed the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the Spanish Savings Bank merger process began, there were several entities that ensured that they were not going to participate in the first phase and that they were reserving for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d'Epargnoes (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers have been achieved, it cannot be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cavia group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most has been fully achieved; it is possible that instead of 17 we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated extensively in this operation as well", stressed the leader.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Leaders and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process is being carried out 'at the greatest speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is achieved within the time frame set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain'.
'The switch to 45 boxes with an average of 28 500 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million is a lawsuit unparalleled in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to be in line with Basel,' he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a rather unhappy opinion on the slowness of the process" which demonstrate "a lack of sericity and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain is reminding us that the deadline must be respected before the end of the year".
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and "probably" in the world and has given people who question it a 'lack of knowledge'.
The leader mentioned that, given the current economic situation, "we can remain very quiet" with the situation of financial and savings banks, a system that has started a "very important" and "go at the greatest speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector had done well in the stress tests that ECB had carried out in July.
zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has laid down the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have caused a shocking government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodriguez has announced new adjustment methods, which range from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private employment agencies or the abolition of the EUR 426 aid for unemployed persons without any professional contribution to the privatisation of the 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and the 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe Gonzalez, joins Chancellor Angela Merkel's criticism of her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which shocks that it will be to maintain the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, in Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible exits of the crisis.
The former, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the currency zone.
The second, the Mark's recovery, even though now it seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, nearly 50% of the population.
The third, a new concept of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines for countries that infringe them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extending the costs of potential adjustments to the private sector.
The German position is clear and it has been defined for a long time, so now there is no room for an apology.
First, in 2009, when both IMF and the European Commission boosted deficits, the German government invented constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016 onwards.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought that we should do (fiscal rule and fiscal stability) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second shot of the central European country was when Merkel hardly prolonged the decision to save Greece.
From that moment it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and published it were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union’s treaties to make the rescue of a country and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But its proposal, although somewhat watered down, was approved and, in the following months, we should see the reform process of the Union which is possible with these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think of cross-section.
And it tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not agree too much, from that date the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new currency area, in which countries that break the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to stop paying and, in that case, the private sector will also bear a party of costs.
Germany tells us that we need to follow a strong growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, like the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The stake is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just a question of renewing the government deficit by 3% in 2013.
What we are asked to do is much harder.
And what he absolutely must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will lead to greater tranquillity.
And that we know how to seize the opportunity we were given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that the President has also heard this in this form and its double statement (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past on Saturday with the big business and yesterday's announcement of the new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticism, the way has been opened to the thesis that we need to put order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
Among the possibilities that we are considering, one cannot rule out the possibility of abandoning a currency area that is too full of unserious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sport and fraud
The tricks similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the will to escape punishment.
The expulsion hatching in principle by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 game against Ajax in the Champions League caused much ink to flow on the anti-sporting character of such behaviour and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is known, a few minutes before finishing the game (which their team was already clearly gaining), the two players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will eventually be leader of his group, the two players will be sanctioned during the next game of the play-off match against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cards in the next phase.
Eventually, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee sanctioned team coach José Mourinho with two matches and various economic sums to the players involved.
The provocative of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or the like is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of ethos, unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate that appeared in the case is due to the fact that this has had as its protagonist a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem displays nobility and honour and which on past occasions has fined its players for similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Mourinho, who adds another episode to his technician.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is to say, whether, with these actions, a law fraud is committed; because, in fact, they are respectful actions with the sports regulations, but seem to be avoiding its meaning.
The question is to examine the kind of harm they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the goods that understands sportsmanship is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that these actions have not been put at risk, i.e. there has been no violent play.
Another of these goods that is being referred to with the correct game is to prevent the team of the introcarcer players from taking unfair advantage of the team to the contrary, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of Real Madrid players is that it does not live up to what is normally characterized as cheating on law fraud, because its violation of the rules was not carried out in secret to try to avoid punishment, but their action has precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the arbitration of the arbitrator.
They were waiting and willingly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the kind of benefit that offenders get the intented and faults examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that we do not put the rival in a situation of disadvantage and we do not get an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action presupposes leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club wouldn't be able to count on these players.
Obviously, the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team could be eliminated all of a sudden and apart from that, with this action, the players are completing a penalty match and moving to the second round of cardboard, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of the cartons occurs with one less than the first cycle.
So climbing the ladder is not so clear that it is an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the sporting spirit, from which strategic decisions are still taken part, which promote the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction (this would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law), but they chose instead the moment in which they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without foiling the penalty or fleeing it.
Even if the line between genius and law fraud is diffuse, on this occasion I think we had a clear case of genius.
The polemic, it seems to me, is apparent because of two factors: because there have been two self-expulsions and because of the way in which the director is passed on to provoke them.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offensive of offered to capture Christmas dinners for groups in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of celebrations self-financed by employees who wish to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the turon and the lottery, when December also comes the pre-Christmas dinners of groups, which continue to be the oxygen balloon for the restaurants and entertainment restaurants in Barcelona, but which, because of the crisis, led to an offensive that prices adjusted to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, coincide with the businessmen and associations in the sector interviewed.
To complete the accounting process, this year's schedule (like New Year's Eve falls on Friday) concentrated applications in the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 17th and 17) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying with their own pockets.
Any situation, they all demand battle prices, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauraci de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The employer's representative, now, does not dare to predict how the holidays will be this month.
"People think a lot before they book."
'They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to the prices,' he says.
The case will be "for those who give quality at a good price and with a good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the tranche around EUR 25 has become the majority in demand.
A survey in various facilities in the centre shows the collapse of applications for the night of 17.
The Soteras Group says that there is a genuine demand boom for that Friday, with the aim of spending less than EUR 30, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the economic situation, with complete formulas of EUR 25 to 35.
In the case of another powerful group, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the particularity of the calendar assumed more advance bookings, even from the beginning of November.
'We have done the utmost to maintain the same prices for the past year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to EUR 30,' they say.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, remains optimistic after detecting a boom in billing since the second half of the year and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Group sources mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays ahead.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend a 10% more than last year instead of requiring more details, such as Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again invite their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
On behalf of the employers Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, confides in the possibility to start seeing the final tunnel and maintains that overall reservations are "anilitated", even if customers "shall be able to take maximum self-trade".
That is true, the hope for the festivities has not gone down, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear program is causing great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "fast faster than any other country".
Wikileaks filtrations confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the American Embassy in Pakistan and the United States State Department filtered through the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns expressed in Washington with Pakistan's nuclear programme.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details on the content of the conversations and thoughts of the North American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "deceasing" and that the unstable Asian country is producing nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear programme -- the fact that weapons are not assembled, but they are being sized by components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack -- is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
For example, Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson, listed in a report prior to the visit of former National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities to the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersal of nuclear materials whose noise is short and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason for keeping guard.
"Pakistan had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Externals during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered through the portal of Julian Assange is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level of production of nuclear weapons in Pakistan.
An Embassy dispatch in May, which describes the communication with Pakistan as 'furgitive', argues that: 'Transparency is frequently non-existent; offers of aid remain unanswered or eliminated'.
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, D.C., during a visit by the Army Chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to convey "very clearly" the official that "the Pakistan Army must end with tacit support to terrorist groups".
Hunting for the Chief of Wikileaks
Obama will count on a senior counter-terrorism official to avoid further infiltration.
Interpol issues a red alert to track movements and locate in Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localise and track the movements" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, it is not new, otherwise it dates from 20 November.
And it has nothing to do with the latest filtration of more than a quarter of US diplomatic documents, but with accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian is facing in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' lawyer, Mark Stephens, said that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
On the 20th the international police force based in Lyon, France, dictated the order at the request of Sweden, but did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving the authorization of the authorities of that country.
For example, 188 Interpol countries were instructed to identify or locate Assange "for his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the Red Notice call a free route for the arrest -- which the national police corps must carry out - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement indignanted to Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder was willing to answer questions from the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange applied for and obtained the permit to leave the prosecutor's case from Sweden, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's Chief Security Officer.
'It seems like a hunt, not legal persecution,' the missive says.
While the world is searching for him -- and in Australia his mother defends his son's innocence -- Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he doesn't keep quiet.
On Monday, he gave an unspecified place an interview with the editor of the magazine Time through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that she has been responsible for giving orders to American graduates that they spice up at the UN by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the request for a resignation as "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not at all sure why a guy's opinion with a web page should interest us," he said for the CNN.
Obama himself has instructed a senior counter-terrorism official, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s speech’s attempt to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who from January will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House, has asked the Department of State to consider the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute to anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance".
Even further went to Tom Flanagan, a Canadian President Stephen Harper's adviser, who had to return to his statements after saying that Assange should "be assassinated".
"Obama should turn it into a lens and wear an unmanned aircraft or something similar."
One person who did not ask for an apology was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"He who is in the Government that has filtered the information is guilty of treason and all that is not an execution would be too kind a punishment," he said for Fox.
Puigcers seeks peace in ERC with winks to Carod followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposed a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcerces seems to have found the recipe for solving the umpteenth internal revolt inside ERC, without north due to the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for former leader Josep Lluas Carod-Rovira's followers, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that this can absolutely not give him headaches that he had with other out-of-flows.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new criticism with nods that allow him to blind up to the municipal elections.
As a first step, Puigcers announced yesterday that more than 200 ERC national members will be able to comment on its continuity in secret.
By means of ballot papers, not by raising the hand.
If the carodists want to convey a certain penalty vote to the president, they will be able to do so without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader wants to avoid the image of division and the image of submission to his person.
In several interviews he claimed that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without mentioning the percentages, that a "Bulgarian" result would not be good either.
The persons close to Carod demand a little more than make his position available to militancy, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcers controls the maxim organ between the congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive on a road map until May.
To that end, they hoped to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that management would submit to the vote of the National Council on 18.
His intention was to support Puigcers in exchange for his promise to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which leaders saw as a sure fact.
The ERC leader admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that its purpose is to make the organization once and for all capable of washing its laundry room with the family.
In this line, the article that current adviser Josep Huguet has signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered Puigcers' ideologue, the incumbent of Innovacai thought that the fact that the leader would be ratified "in exchange for various purposes" was as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, two of which he points out.
The first, "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, that is to say, to include new figures from the Carodian sector.
The second may be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that the assembly's liquid ERC once and for all as the operating mechanism.
Thus, it defends a reform of the statutes that allows the congresses to be held through elected delegates.
Finishing with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession with the Puigcers team, which has already struggled in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 Conclave convulse instructed the management to revise the assembly model in a specific congress of the reform of the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, the time could be a good time to take it back and close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.

China maintains targets for reducing greenhouse gases
The country's representative in COP16 assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and had detailed its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions between 40 and 45 per cent until 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions between 40 and 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, representing the country at COP16.
In his first public appearance in the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that her country had made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and reconnect its industry.
Indeed, he said, the past four years his country had inverted 245 million dollars in efforts to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.
Nevertheless, he had made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but it would continue to work together with the international community in that area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution-building; and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including the approval last year of a new Energy Law, which recognises the objectives addressed with regard to the reduction of greenhouse gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with government and locals to achieve the goals of energy savings, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-annual plans under way or completed, both financed by the Chinese Government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned, the Efficient Energy Usage Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investment from the United Nations, the government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of incandescent lamps by thrills and another mitigation and adaptation project, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country's government's scientific adviser on climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater.
For example, he said, the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China is three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for the 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the energy age, how to increase energy efficiency a 20% over the last five years and plans to do another similar one around 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The PAN national leader detailed that the former pan-elect leader has the right to approach the National Commission to claim what is right.
PAN's national leader, César Nava Vazquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former pan-elect leader has the right to apply to the National Order Commission to claim what by law.
In the pre-test interview of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Commission of Order."
"Mr Espino has the right to apply, if necessary, by making a complaint to the Commission of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body", he noted.
On the other hand, he has shed light that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for presidential candidacy.
Nava Vazquez expressed his conviction that the National would be stronger after the internal elections of the next 4 and 5 December, when a successor is expected to be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, it has been a successful approach to local elections and has achieved its goal," he said.
The pan-panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not frighten us; on the contrary, 'we savor it and make us stronger", he said.
He said that the council will no doubt know how to spell the best leader whom Accion Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the statement "to the person determined by the council."
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the party's office of president to any of the five."
He predicted that the party's recovery in the past 4 July elections would be reflected in the next dispute, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"For the time being, it is a question of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task".
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that we have made ourselves "much hopes for them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to the expectations".
When PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderon was asked about his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the petitioners to reflect on the six years of former Presidents Ernesto zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of 'edillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderon; let them start defending them; let them come out of 'cuprooms'," he said.
He stated that the holder of the federal executive could make expressions such as those he made in his speech in the National Auditory, because in the country there was no gag, let alone censorship.
Obama Promotes Law on Twitter for Undocumented Students
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call you senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Tweeted the US president in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama gathered today for national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call you senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Obama said.
Its short message keeps a cyber link open with a larger document that asks the public to contact senators immediately, as voting on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that we hope to be taken soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was leaked after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the passage of any legislation if the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding continued.
Such a stalemate, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confidant that once the tax problem is resolved, a commonplace for the rest of the projects can be fixed.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be resolved before the end of the year..."
'I think we can get an agreement at some point in this direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,' he said.
Democratic Senate majority leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would call for a "cencing debate vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, although the most likely would be next week.
The senatorial version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 80 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they remained in that country for the last five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the help of a large number of Republicans, at times when protagonist partisan organizations protagonists lobbying to secure approval of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 places.
Nevertheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said that he would vote against it and only one Republican expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar de Indiana.
That is why supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Between the most courted Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of office on Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they have said that they will not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his posture so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the greater obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature we put our finger on the wound
The second stage of the Pleasures of the Language was a walk in which participants showcased the storytelling.
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? What do we hope for me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of Language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this time used the subtitle of his question (during another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language," explained it).
With our fingers on the wounds"... embarrasses us," the Argentine writer gently told the public, most of the young people who had gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramarez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garcia Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined after as a great story, with Luisa in first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "woman", she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: 'Patience is not my strength, it may be my wound'.
At the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who took his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to him that the wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst that the mystery reveals: "the wound is what is actually open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concludes: 'on the wound I have only been able to know that it is who is actually open and that it does not exist', but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very closely linked to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramirez also exhibited a lovely narration that he titled "Solue to Invention", where the finger on the wound is not named but at some point is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he talks about a famous bewitching woman touching clouds, turning people who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a dameise had lost, a narrative that turns to talk to America, the great news that had from the very beginning his own chroniclers and quoted in Bernal Daaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses.
"The vivids that invented us all (writers) mocked the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in an ardent way we would never have told the story of America with an imagination that even lacked modesty."
Nevertheless, he stressed, "mad people and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with the lie, we no longer know what part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
This is actually called the 'Cerrvantes tradition'.
"It is through his legacy that one is what one's storytelling".
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the FIL invitation with his Le-dos round table on the wound.
Cuba's Puerto Rican woman had her own at the great scourge of social violence that her country was going through -- and Latin America, shared -- produced disputes over the trafficking and sale of drugs.
'I think good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not, of course, premeditated,' she said, after quoting that the reality of the literature is the communication and dimension of the engagement that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a 'chemical reaction' of the latter.
The evening is over with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis Garcia Montero, who also stressed "it must on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at high speed also in terms of intellectual habits and the control of consciences that revolves to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind each statement there is a small no and behind each negation there is a small yes".
'To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means a lot of times pointing to the wound and disturbing people who feel very convenient thinking by caricature, white and black, in established and unstinted ideas and also disturbing the powers that prefer a world in white and black,' he said, inviting to recover the meaning of writing.
Romano hunting his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals he had ups and downs in his career, but he was able to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast between them marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals, he had ups and downs in his career, but he was able to reach the decisive series three times, even though so far he has not put it in the mile and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentine eventually consoles himself with the sub-champion medal, he stayed a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The sandist strategist arrived at his first final as a coach in the 2002 Open Tournament, when he held the reins of Morelia with whom he lost with an overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closure he also reached the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and this was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a setback again, as his team had an equal match of 2–2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty series he got an advantage for 3–1 with two opportunities to get the title and eventually three of his players missed 11 meters and he suffered the jump to the result of 4–3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, so he doesn't want to have the same fate, he tries to detach himself from the evil to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, even though he says that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I'll get the title, but what I mentioned earlier is more important," commented the helmsman when asked what his weaknesses would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the final, from which he assures that he learned a lot, "The only lesson we can learn is that until the referee whistles the final, we can't celebrate, we're prepared in the line, the players too, because last time, with two penalties to pull we were already prepared to run and I think that's a lesson, before the end of the game the game can'".
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he confides in his players: "We never seek to arrive at the series of penalties, we try to end in the regular period, but sometimes we only have to prepare ourselves, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately the destiny has made us a bad trick, sometimes it is the emotions or the anguish of holding the title in our hands,That's it."
Romano now has the opportunity not to be a sub-champion technician and to taste for the first time the fame offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Individuals must attend Visa Applicant Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of the waiting time will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011, the visa processing procedure at the United States Embassy and Consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, the majority of applicants will be required to report to the Visa Applicant Service Centres (ASC, according to their abbreviations in English) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the biometric information of the applicant, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have some advantages for aspirants, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to obtain an appointment, another payment for the processing of the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current fare will remain the same: the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars in the case of applications visas (includes visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for merchant and investor visas.
Those who wish to renew their visa should not appear in an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only report to the nearest ASC where they will present the documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be taken from the CSA, applicants who wish to have a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will be less time-consuming than before.
Similarly, visa applicants to the Consulates of Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra-service rate of 26 dollars.

NASA to announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The United States Space Agency quoted the press to present a discovery tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will provide tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday, at 13:00 at NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C., for experts in astrobiology, science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When it quoted the press, NASA assured that it would present who would have an impact on the research of extraterrestrial life," which sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if its living conditions are improved.
It seems to be a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought to be too venomous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsen.
In any form, the creature uses the aseen as a way of life, and that ability makes us think that a similar life might exist on other planets that do not have our volunteer atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenics in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the findings in tomorrow's press conference on Thursday.
The conference will feature geobiology Pamela Conrad, which studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest satellite), from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
Germa PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patron 'block' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is possible, it is denounced.
The 60th had just taken place when in Congress a bloc opposed by the deputies of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesus Manuel Patron Montalvo, who declared himself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of the 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'tonished' against the reform of the Organic Law, for it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, we are initiating 'bipartism' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
The four MEPs, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Executive Board chaired by PANEL, Salvador Lopez Brito and Luis Antonio Cordenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these reforms institutionally represent the political marginality on the part of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the pattern from political will and if they did not, they would again be enslaved by both parties and in that way would end the opposing coalition.
"So far has arrived (the opposing coalition) is what I am looking at, because we are excluded from any decision, they do not even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez, of Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patron there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, after having been monopolistic, is now "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is an eternal bipartism in Congress."
To begin with, this group starts with five legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, has abounded the Convergent.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that now the Congress has been transformed into a 'cinder' between two, referring to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Patron Montalvo asked to respect the Member's personality, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"Let them not leave by cupular cupular agreements outside 5 which will probably be 9 Members, now to the five that we are seen, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unite to look for a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform that they have made, that they have decided, we are outside and we do not agree with this reform".
200 million more for "the supplier"
The Mazatlan City Council pays another cheque to the questioning owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another cheque of about 200 pesos for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
Together with the latter, the amount paid in the second half of the year to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipe, the latter cheque number 9258447 was issued in the past 16 November for the amount of 200 mil 144.56 pesos, in the concept of "cost of supplier account".
Treasurer Luis Miguel Lopez Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We haven't bought anything, we just pay him what we owe him, as for the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Official Gazette, according to the Act's forecasts when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after 25 July Noroeste had published a revision of the cheques that the City Council issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the interval March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel Lopez Sanchez, the Municipe to pay Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites must be treated
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the poor conditions of the bushut in Mazatlan.
After a foreign tourist fell in a dip in the roundabout of Sanchez Taboada, the tourist sector in Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor condition and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Association of Traders in Dorada, recalled that they had repeatedly called for the image of the destination to be cared for and new activities should replace the other tourists found bad.
He said that the poor state of the streets and sidewalks affected because tourists came there to walk around and they saw the mess and avoided nearby shops.
"Politicians do not know what it means to close a business one day and they do not know the fortune that is being lost, they do not do the job for so long and without proper planning."
Hotels José Ramon Manguart Sanchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the City Council.
'The municipe will have to take responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it, so through preventive maintenance and only do the correction,' he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area should we maintain it, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live there and the City Council must change its strategy to properly maintain the city."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlan.
'Today, because the tourist comes, it depends only on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that is cleaned in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions,' he said.
"There have been no attention to be paid to them, and this kind of fact highlights something that is well known to all, the interview is necessary".
Rael Llera Martinez, under secretary of Tourist Promotion, said that the recovery of the tourist sites of Mazatlan is urgent, as they are not used correctly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must go online in combination with the municipe and be a priority in order to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
'Hierily Mazatlon offers many historical and cultural sites that we should first order, clean and put ourselves online to make them attractive so that they can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination.'
IP calls for results in Congress
The President of CCE, Eduardo Davalos, proposed that MEPs shoulder the great responsibility of being an example for a Sinaloa better because of the various provocations that confronts.
The business sector of Mazatlan calls for a Legislature of work worthy of free working between the parties and the government executive, because Sinaloa is convulsed and faces major problems.
Yesterday we installed the 60th legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 PRI deputies, 13 from PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM, in a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectative that the new members of the government Congress is a management of its own and committed with society and the various sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism are not repeated.
The President of CCE, Eduardo Davalos, proposed that MEPs shoulder the great responsibility of being an example for a Sinaloa better because of the various provocations that confronts.
"We hope that Members are really exercising their rights, free from agreements between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to look after their own interests and they turn into carnival charades of the leaders and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
That is why I ask them to certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that the current Governor is making.
"We will ensure that they do a dignified job and especially engaged with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramon Manguart Sanchez, President of the Association of Hotels Tres Islas, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 people's representatives is to push and add forces in seeking the economic growth of the State, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and this in a way will stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he requested that the new legislators attach the importance it had in the Government budget in order to strengthen the Secretariat of Government Tourism.
"I have understood that this is the second Secretariat of the State with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as an important economic activity and generating foreign exchange and investment and which competes directly with the agro-industry."
Apart from the need to classify resources for detonating tourism projects that help to give the State security and update the Alcohol Act, which previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for king mage
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the wishes of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Three Wise Men will be difficult to accomplish their illusions, because their home is formed by no more and no less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, Maria Guadalupe, Isaias, José Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will wear the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day-to-day because their father is not in a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with the 'stubs' for sale in the street,' says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
In turn, José Alfredo, a 10-year-old, long year-old 'monster truck' and for his 8-month-old younger brother Jesus, Cayetana suggests waist clothes for a year.
"He said (José Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster', but I said 'we'll see, my son', because he was very dear," recalls Cayetana with sadness.
For older children, who were at school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, stands in size 12; Isaias, 10 years old, stands for size 10, while Miguel, aged 8, stands for size eight.
José Juan, 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the children's dream of the Coronado Valenzuela family reality you can participate in the On Cherche Roi Mage campaign, giving a toy or money at the Noroeste reception.
14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used for production have been seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for the Sûreté du Québec.
A total of 11 men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Arrested persons were to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession for trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
The searches took place following a lengthy investigation, which lasted almost a year.
'It was information received from the public that enabled us to make these arrests,' said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 officers of the regional investigation module of the Estrie de la Sûreté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Régie de police Memphémagog took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without problems
The Conservatives’ bill, which, according to the government, should address the problem of boats loaded with illegal migrants, is clearly going to be defeated as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand with a party that created granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, as he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow up to one year to be held anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he was attacking the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do", said Mr. Duceppe.
The NDP's immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, has rejected backfire on critics of her party that her party is not firm enough about illegal immigrants.
"New Democrats agree that action should be taken against smugglers, and that is what we are doing through another bill, the C-35," said Ms Chow.
"We do not support the Conservatives' bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," explained Ms Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians say en masse to Members that they are not tolerating this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a doormat."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The Government had not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections if it were rejected.
One Conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that every Member who opposes then explains to his or her constituents.
The new unit is not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public commission of inquiry on the subject.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea is not new: Quebec City reportedly consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this subject last January.
The metropolis has had a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
Yet Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on the Police Services of Quebec on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was not more necessary for the pequest critic on public security, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this announcement a "lapse out of a hat" and a "do-t-youred solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power would have too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You go and see the result when we're going to announce it," he says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is no substitute for the establishment of a public inquiry.
"More Mr. Charest insists on not wanting to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and I have something to hide,' he explains.
'The only way to have a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest,' explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To break this deadlock, he therefore suggested that Quebec City should give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government's boxes.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering some of the amendments related to this issue.
In Operation Spring 2001, which affected groups of motorcyclists, although the Criminal Code was not appropriate, 131 persons were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several rivers remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfall in several parts of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another slip appears in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road sagged.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell in several areas, with 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
From an additional 20 to 40 millimetres of rain was expected by Thursday evening, depending on the region.
The areas north of the river and in the Ottawa Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of total rain.
Since this precipitation is to be added to the melting of snow already accumulated in some areas, there is a fear of the overflow of several rivers.
Flood alert warnings were issued on Wednesday evening by the Quebec Civil Security for the Ouareau and Achigan Rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and of the Chêne, in Lotbinière, were the object of flood vigils and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has led to the overflow of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge washed away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In the Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes led to the closure of several roads, notably in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecasting Centre issued warnings of strong floods on Wednesday for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and du Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback to the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) for controversial remarks about social assistance and Haitians as well as his rude language on the air.
CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but some statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and rude language that is not suitable for daytime broadcasts".
The Council also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the names of two persons who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Front Commun des personnes assisted sociales du Québec.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the issue were inaccurate.
The facilitators should provide sound rather than misleading information.
With regard to suicide, the animator Stéphane Dupont had considered suicide to be a cowardly gesture.
The majority of the members of the Committee had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes involved in "Dupont at noon" have addressed a sensitive issue in a fair and appropriate manner."
No blame was therefore held on him.
The last dispute concerned statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort then engaged in a media situation that had elicited a lot of reactions.
The CHOI host said that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because we could not know for sure that the needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constituted an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already cleaned my three-day suspension on that."
"My file has been blank for a year and a half," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of coarse language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, inter alia, have to announce these decisions once during prime time within three days.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine zemmal has an extremely special course.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing up the tatami and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," explained zemmal, who had been in the metropolis since 2008 to play with professionals.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere, because for those who don't like the ground game in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the one who works as a security officer and as a clerk for the UPS company has delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Amateur World Championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the full contact and Thai boxing categories," he explained.
"At the moment, I'm preparing to go to China for the San Shou World Cup."
"Fighters who finished in the top four in the last World Championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament fifth, when I came third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've progressed at every competition."
"At this beat, I'll be first this time or next year."
San shou or "sanda" is a discipline from China where punches and kicks, as well as ground projections, are allowed.
The duels take place originally on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most renowned pugilist from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
While Nacer has only one event in his career, he will certainly respond to his presence at the "King of Sanda" super tournament, the kung fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is the most up and prestigious in China," explained the sympathetic fellow.
"This is kind of the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It's been a great experience."
He won his first fight, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"He who defeated me was a real pro," he analyzed.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals face each other in the finals."
"Then, the winners of each category face each other in order to crown a single champion, the kung fu king."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded contract finance to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project by TC450 million.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor has obtained the largest, that of the management of the project, for a sum of 295 million dollars without a call for tenders.
This consortium, called Énergie gérance, was set up in 2004 together with Hydro-Québec's choice to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project, which will be worth .
In early 2005, the Managing Energy consortium won the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Partie Québécois, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing price increases.
"This is the new way of colluding and shooting down competition."
"In other words, instead of doing this secretly, now do it openly," PQelacy MP Sylvain Simard said yesterday at the press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said he was difficult to see how public interest could be served in that way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, vehemently denying that there was collusion on the contract.
"I'm starting to get my journey," she said, arguing that the PQ had been "malacrial" and had "lacked rigour."
She said that "it would be the least" that the PQ apologized.
The consortium formula is a common practice worldwide.
It is usually a time-bound alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The project is under way and is scheduled until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition action; there was negotiation.
Thus, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the consortiums in the consulting engineering sector is being investigated by the Government.
A quick overview of the Quebec business register shows more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and others Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, brings back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
With regard to the Energie gerrance management consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of James Bay is responding to particular manpower dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been responding specifically to them since the 1970s".
The big head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Company (SEBJ), gave an explanation that raised the eyebrow that the project's management contract was granted by agreement.
"If you go on a tender and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in this market and say: we're going to negotiate a satisfactory deal and at a good price."
'But the idea is that it's not the price that's important, it's people's competence,' said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the consortium Energie gerrancerance is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 euros obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering-advisory contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin won 22 contracts, Génivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not to mention his participation in Énergie gétier.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total EUR 449,783,344, including the Contract for Energy Management of EUR 295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard hinted that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor) are "well known in the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau dropped that the PQ is also linked to these firms that “finance” it, before pointing out that it was more like its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also fair trade marks and green certifications to guide their choices.
Worse, even if he is immersed in a media world where the messages for more responsible consumption abound, he deplores a lack of credible information, which he even describes as a brake on his commitment, says the barometer of responsible consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although Quebecers have increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say that they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies, as do the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Responsible Consumption Observatory of the Sherbrooke University.
Another finding is that half of consumers are questioning the reliability of official certifications on so-called fair products, but also of the credibility of products and brands that qualify as eco-responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, politicians’ discourse on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be essential to stimulate this part of consumption currently animated by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and dubious nature of information would calm the ardor of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
On the other hand, one third of Quebecers also express their distrustful of the alleged performance of the green products or services that they are being asked to take their hands.
On another note, consumers in 2010 changed their habit and, above all, changed brands from one or more products to their belief.
Sixty-six per cent of them also favoured purchases from shopkeepers in their neighbourhood and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region, according to the Barometer.
Greener and responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about the protection of animals.
But his social and ecological conscience seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers said they had used public transport or advocated car-sharing to defend their green interests.
The walk and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioural survey, which has just taken its first shot.
A state loan for the takeover of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to make a financial commitment to the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to collaborate, but only up to a loan.
The Société de développement Angus et le Parallèle, which had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy from Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard by restoring its full cinephilic vocation, did not obtain what they demanded.
The government agreed to get involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan, the amount of which would be lower than the initial expectations, which could constitute a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of sources from the State's pharmacies.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the petitions have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who is leading the eXcentris dossier.
He sent him a final report some 10 days ago.
But the cabinet’s counter-proposal reached SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have to answer until 31 December.
It seems, however, that the assumption of the State's gift should really be set aside.
It should be recalled that the Association des propriétaires de cinémas et de cinémas du Québec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture did not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several stakeholders in the field called for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of Ceans, defeated the author's cinema at his premises at his premises of the complex after he had financed its construction himself, which could justify a derogation on the part of the Treasury Board.
The lack of cinemas for independent films was screaming in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to retain its customers.
The Angus Company and the Parallèle, headed by Christian Yaccarini, were piloting a private fundraising campaign, hoping to raise 700,000 dollars to push the wheel of acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, continues to broadcast films at eXcentris.
The aim of future buyers is to reopen the three theatres on February 27 by screening the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois Des hommes et des goeux.
But Christian Yaccarini did not call Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group are thinking of the downward proposals made to them.
The veil raised on a complex Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables leaked by WikiLeaks unveil what the United States considers to be the Canadians' inferiority complex to the Americans, but at the same time betrayed their sense of superiority over Canada.
For example, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter does not have Canadian-American relations in mind when they go to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit helped the Conservative government get its budget passed in 2009.
The four new communications between the US Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, displayed in the public square yesterday, offer more crisp details than substantial content to put under the teeth.
A cable dated 22 September 2008, in the midst of the federal election campaign, describes the extent to which the United States is not among the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the astonishment of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanation for this situation.
"An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may condition Canadian political leaders to talk about everyday affairs domestic issues rather than making the election look to the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign)," he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about it."
The ambassador understands all the less so much that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically," he said, "the ability of a candidate, a party and even more than a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to vote."
The other expression of this sense of importance reads in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, a Chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival in the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, whereby Canada will have its first deficit in more than a decade because of a stimulus package of 30 to 40 billion dollars," writes. Breese.
Nowhere is there any mention that the government had to prorogue Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties were making its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the drama series broadcast at CBC are sending back from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which include unsubtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the CIA's muscular interrogation abductions.
Another cable recounts that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to welcome some of the prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of the "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, it says, "he handed a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian descent."
"The secretary agreed to review the dossier".
Finally, it should be noted that the minds are warming up for the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC that the person responsible for the massive flight should be "stupidized".
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate lighting
Yesterday in Cancun, the United Nations proposed a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gases (GHGs) that corresponds to almost one third of the additional reduction that needs to be achieved in order to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to have adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding commitments to reduce by the industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if the incandescent light bulbs that still monopolize 50-70% of the market were replaced by compact fluorescent light bulbs or, better still, by light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, the bulk of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHGs emitted over the planet to lighten humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, embarked on voluntary reduction plans that are expected to increase overall GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract from this still 5 Gt balance sheet to stabilize by 2020 the increase in the climate at 2 degrees centigrade in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent light bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
With compact fluorescent light bulbs, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this need for energy is reduced by two more times.
Compact fluorescent light bulbs last on average from 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those launched by the Philips manufacturer this week - this company participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent light bulb, which gives an idea of the economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These brand new light bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emitting very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have had reservations about CFLs as they contain mercury and need to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers are issuing instructions.
But, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the CFL, but rather coal-fired thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce wasted electricity in incandescent light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost it 2.5 billion dollars.
Côte d'Ivoire awaits the announcement of the electoral results in nervousness
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the publication of the presidential election results in Côte d'Ivoire "without delay, after the deadline has expired".
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," said a spokesman for the head of the United Nations.
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and the institutions to exercise responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission missed Wednesday's cut-off date without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's election.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the President of the CIS had stated on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
Calls have multiplied on Wednesday in the world for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between incumbent Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp counts on the annulment by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former rebellion of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the Ivorian president's campaign manager, claimed that the intimidation of voters in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president to vote.
The entire election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo were held by the Constitutional Council.
However, Gbagbo's opponents believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North who denies any connection with the ex-rebels, considered the delay in announcing the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that had remained split in two years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round on 31 October, with 38% of the vote against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France, within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ILO), has remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7%, including the overseas departments), show the provisional seasonally adjusted data (CVS) published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed in metropolitan France is 2.631 million.
Data for the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the working population in metropolitan France and 9.7% with the French overseas departments.
Over one year, the unemployment rate is increased by 0.1 percentage point.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people on the labour market has deteriorated further, with a further increase in the unemployment rate, to 24.2% in metropolitan France (- 0.9 points over three months, up 0.5 points over one year) and 25% by including the French overseas departments.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed in the sense of ILO.
Senior citizens, on the other hand, experienced a slight increase in unemployment, at 6.4% in metropolitan France (0.2 points over three months and over one year), i.e. 482 000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with the French overseas departments.
Only 25-49-year-olds enjoyed stable unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points over three months, 0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
INSEE no longer publishes a monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, on the other hand, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including the DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Gérini charged and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, manager of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, was indicted and contracted at the Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Gérini was indicted for abuse of social property, embezzlement of funds and public property, concealment, active bribery, trading in influence and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexander Guérini is combative and wants to explain himself on all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, not fantasies."
"It is easy to pursue him for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it is another matter of proving them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before his client's hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strongman of the PS in the department, Jean-Noel Guérini, managed, through his lawyers, to pass the judge before his hearing a memo in order to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged on Wednesday evening and imprisoned.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but to operate the landfills he had to deal with.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of funds related to their operation, he was never aware of them, said Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was indicted on Wednesday for embezzlement of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with the prohibition of meeting the protagonists in the case.
"My client has been able to explain the facts of which he is accused."
"The examining magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of his liberty", said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been charged and released on the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, with judicial supervision for two of them, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General for Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), was prosecuted for "traffic of influence and passive corruption".
Two officials of the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged one with "subtraction and misappropriation of public property by a person carrying out a public service mission", the other for "complicity in embezzlement of public funds".
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, was indicted for "received the abuse of social property".
Among those who have been confronted with Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement in Corsica.
Investigators suspect that his companies were used to launder money from big banditry.
The investigation is carried out in several judicial reports, which was opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous letters, for alleged fraud in public procurement, in particular in the waste sector.
From sources close to the investigation, investigations focus in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as from certain cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysée exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", kept the public in his mind in France, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of US diplomats.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of the underside of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to Americans, going so far as to give them advice on dealing with their own "hostage" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman had not been matched by the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian man detained in France and wanted by the US courts for trafficking in materials for Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they put under a stark light the way in which the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, it was not.
A diplomatic cable book written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comment on how to deal with hostage cases".
The Elysée's adviser on strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, met with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own forcibly held nationals to Iran.
'Structise,' they say, 'smart constantly' in the media the words 'fundamental human rights', 'innocence', 'immediate release'.
This is needed to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more because the Iranians are asking you not to do it."
After attempts at discussion through discrete channels, 'silence will pay nothing', Iranians are 'master in delaying manoeuvres'.
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which would take place on 16 August, the day she took refuge at the French Embassy) "necessary for the payment to Iranians of a large sum of money" (2,330 000 euros deposit).
And he says that the Elysée is anticipating other hostage-taking crises, a phenomenon that "makes worse".
Iranians could "in the near future stop another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days, but remains stranded in Iran.
One piece of information is being disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition to the United States for illegal trafficking in sensitive electronic material to Iran, is released in Paris, by decision of a judge.
The American Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is tracking down Iran's clandestine nuclear-trading networks for nuclear programming, Majid Khakavand's enlargement is bad news.
Has France accepted a bargaining microenterprise?
The liberation of the Iranian from that of the Frenchwoman?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier said that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he said, not only "belonged completely surprised by the judge's decision", but sought to oppose it.
"There have been lively exchanges between the French Presidency and the Keeper of the Seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot reverse the decision" judicial, he observes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" supervision of the French intelligence services.
The Elysée councillor dials a telephone number, hangs up, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris run by the Iranian Embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée is not working hard, through press releases and "leaks" in the media, to make people believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad is playing an "important" and "fluential" role as "mediator".
The Americans observed this activity not without irony, and noted that the manipulation was fruit, since several press articles passed on the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 refers to "the 'blitz' media of French officials".
What is so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, wonders the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their praiseful statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The paper then looks at the reasons why the Elysée was to add to this fiction.
The intense communication effort "seeks to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria", he says.
A policy launched in 2008, which "had been perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and undeserved".
By "exagging the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "demonstrate to Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "seed the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On 11 August, François Richier told him: "Of course, we do not know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least confuse the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received it at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the release of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will pass a so-called "Cakesdon" law that will prohibit teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill would be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gambling companies to block access to these games after midnight for young people under the age of 16, said representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many kids play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the government official in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will again be accessible at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the implementation of the law, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the time to daily access to these games for young people whose parents so request, the manager added.
It will also provide people who request it free software to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report a variety of facts related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
2018-2022: FIFA designates the organizing countries
In turmoil due to suspicions of corruption, the FIFA executive committee is on Thursday as the organizing countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, an eminently political choice where influence struggles and lobbying risk taking precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the Queen of FIFA competition will take place in Europe, a traditional stronghold of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
That of 2022 will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its settlement in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides a measure of the economic and political challenges of a World Cup.
Behind-hand negotiations are therefore likely to last until the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Hispano-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not weigh very heavily on the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, which led to the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), may have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football that hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC handed over a layer of the bed on Monday, releasing a documentary that highlights three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
This is displeasing FIFA and embarrassing the English officials, who have launched intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron in the front line.
The Head of Government hopes to repeat the successful blow by his predecessor Tony Blair, who won the 2005 London Olympics.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore England's coat of arms to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the Spanish-Portugal duo has no shortage of assets with its already ready stadiums, its expertise (Mondi-82 in Spain, OJ-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But both countries’ bleak economic and financial prospects could shower their ambitions.
Any reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia's rating, which has become a major outsider despite the shortcomings of its case (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to make the trip to the city and denounced an 'unfair competition in the preparation of the vote', in a thinly veiled allusion to accusations by the English press against members of the EC.
'We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them,' said Mr. Putin.
For 2022, the United States, with the experience of 1994, appears to be the logical favorites.
The country's largest economy, the country's largest economy, the country seems to be one step ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have built a very beautiful project separately.
However, these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organised the test in 2002.
Another threat is the granting of the World Cup-2026 to China, which was ardently desired by FIFA, which would in fact render the Asian chance for 2022 obsolete.
With Qatar, which pulled out the big game by offering futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue to expand into new areas, but these two countries are more risky than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the low TV rights paid (due to the time difference) by European countries, the nerve of the FIFA war.
Second mandate: the obvious
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made people think he was hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One term at the Elysée calls for another.
So the current Head of State will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not go hand in hand with the share of mystery attached to the presidential function.
So we must pretend that doubt still exists.
In both directions.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the autumn of 2011".
He referred to MEPs on Tuesday evening at the Elysée Palace the prospect of "two terms" so sown a little febullated.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were a long way off.
The President only recalled that the 2008 constitutional review limited the number of quinnish tennis companies to two.
He was making an observation, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election, in the tone of humor, at such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he told them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I'm thinking about the next step."
His words the day before did not make him more a candidate than the day before; they did not make him any less.
If they elicit comments, it is for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race to apply to the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the start of Ségolène Royal, who is pushing Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is because its candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the SP are calling for an earlier battle order than expected.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon’s candidacy to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L’Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on this", immediately and cautiously reacted to the Prime Minister's entourage.
"If he believes the possible defeat, he will not be a candidate," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win," Alain Juppé corrected, obviously resigned.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain government securities purchases
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to clarify the modalities for overcoming the crisis or at least to announce the cessation of many of the non-conventional monetary policy operations that must end at the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis obliges, the Frankfurt issue institute will probably not be able to afford to be as perempt, otherwise it will worsen a more than tense situation today in European bond markets.
The political cost would be all the higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde praised the active role played by the ECB in resolving the crisis in the countries' debts in Europe.
It did not wish to say whether it believed that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my thoughts for my European partners (...) ".
The day before, in Brussels, at his hearing by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, had not been more distracted as to his intentions, merely stating that the programme for the purchase of State securities on the secondary market "continuing" and that "we shall see what we shall decide" at this Thursday's meeting.
The only certainty is that the ECB will keep its main policy rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB's purchases of treasury bonds doubled last week to almost EUR 1.35 billion.
And, according to market participants' indiscretions, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the euro-system's central banks have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt about the expectations of continued procurement (see page 29).
Economists, too, do not expect a significant change in course.
While lending operations more than three months old have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations on generous terms and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this package to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that it's significantly changing its program."
'Otherwise, it would be at risk of causing new tensions in the short term,' said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"A gradual release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," warns Sal economist Norbert Brums.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these bonds to animate an athne market", adds Norbert Brums.
Given the importance of European bank exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It must be a substitute for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent the wage of the most fragile governments from paying," a major bond manager said yesterday.
If interest rates soar, governments will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
The safeguarding of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, Berlusconi government is backring
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation has eased yesterday with the turnover of 10-year bond rates a little less.
A return to precarious calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, the regional presidents said they had heard Giulio Tremonti call the situation "indecipherable" and expect a "unpredictable" weekend, which he later denied.
By anyay, the gap with German long-term rates had reached the record 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy-to-equity hedge contracts (CDS) had flew to 263 points, leading to some affixing in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain the gap with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "very concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
'The bad news is that it's like Portugal,' explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In short, its problem is the lack of growth and the sluggish tax revenues that go with it, putting the State at risk of no longer being able to meet its financing needs.
Brussels' latest forecasts have been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under consideration in the Senate is priced at 1.3% and 2% respectively.
In this context, the European Commission calculates the general government deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared with 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour of a new budget collective that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken", said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently receiving support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been repeating it for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no problem immediately, either on the short or in the long term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts required of Italy are less than those demanded of other countries,' notes OECD Chief Economist Pier Carlo Padoan.
There remains the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, following which an early elections could be held at the end of March.
This would open a period of unfavorable decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis schemes
Christine Lagarde hammered it again yesterday at a press conference in Paris: 'Europeans, I believe that it was demonstrated again on Sunday during the day and at night, are obviously united, determined, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone.'
Although relative, yesterday's relaxation on European government bond rates brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet speak of a beginning of normalization.
Standard and Poor's has announced that it could downgrade Portugal's debt rating, the target most targeted today by speculation.
'As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which particularly affects banking systems,' Exanes BNP Paribas economists say.
All the more so because "political weather is much slower than market times".
Aware of this gap and the dangers it conceals, European countries are stepping up discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis schemes.
The informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are well under way.
This is also in view of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the menu, the fate of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the market single-shotters (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform Far Eastern investors about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground for them.
The first issues of EFSF securities are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, a US official told Reuters that the US would support a possible increase in the funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries that are at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, on the other hand, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the context of the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms in addition to austerity measures with closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from Greece and Ireland.
Both are keen to avoid seeking international assistance before putting in place their own fiscal corrections and deciding on the structural reforms needed to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to speed up the process of standardising sovereign bond markets.
In Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had the first to put forward the idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand it over to the portfolio.
The economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an increase of around EUR 100 billion would be "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, which has so far worth EUR 60 billion.
A council that is likely to be carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange vigilance
Snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on orange watchdog due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna have joined the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later that night.
According to Météo France, sustained snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows low on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, from time to time 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Basse-Normandie regions, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snow episodes are notable enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departmental departments have been banned for heavy goods vehicles of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult, according to the gendarmes, who recommend taking one's vehicle only if necessary, and the circulation of some TER buses has been suspended for the day.
School transport was banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at the Paris airport in Roissy and 10% on Thursday because of the coming snowfall.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport in South London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial blueprints
Since the debate on transport modernisation in the Ile-de-France has been in full swing, the billions have been raining down.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion is mentioned for the Grand Paris metro, which the Société du Grand Paris must build.
To start this GSP, the state has announced a capital end of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical pattern, it is this sum that will then allow the GSP to borrow on the markets a share of the financing of its double loop.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Financial Law, reviewed in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the start of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the office tax in Ile-de-France.
The first, the text of the draft law, article 15, reads "to the benefit of the public establishment Société du Grand Paris".
It is estimated: "The proceeds of this tax are EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a redevelopment of an office tax that already exists "in order to modernize it, increase its product and affect this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that be?
Mystery.
This is not encrypted in the text.
We're a long way from the 4 billion.
'It is specified that these tax resources are in addition to the EUR 4 billion of the capital endowment that will be mobilised by the State and provided to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses,' reads the explanatory memorandum.
In the GSP, this system is not shocking.
"From the moment we create revenue (both taxes), we can cover the studies over three years and then type in the 4 billion after, we explain."
"This will be included in the budget and drawn as we go along."
The GSP estimates that the EUR 4 billion will start to be entered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the promised EUR 4 billion is still available to absent subscribers, risks prompting a somewhat turbulent parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Fascinating hackers and espipes in diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it is a apparent scandal, a scandal that only appears as a scandal in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let's do it by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that every file consisting of a secret service (of any nation) consists exclusively of press clippings.
America’s “extraordinary” revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual habits are merely reporting what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those owned by Berlusconi), and Qaddafi’s sinisterly caricatured profile has long been for sketch-arial cabaret artists.
The rule that secret files should be composed only of already known news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templiers or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (or does not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only in what they already know, and which reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same goes for secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited-minded) the head of the secret services (if he could be, I know, editor-in-law), who retains as true only what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the US embassy in Rome was sending to the State Department was the same as that published earlier by Newsweek.
So why did the revelations about these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what any cultured person already knows, namely, that embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since heads of State can telephone or board a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small performance exercises, have turned into spying centres.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only out of hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put American diplomacy under the wrong light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
The scandal therefore does not put the victims as much as the 'rest's crisis.
But let's get to the deep nature of what happened.
In the past, in Orwell's time, one could conceive of everything as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been completely evident since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the motorway taken and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eyes of power.
But when we demonstrate, as it happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as a vengeful citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the possibility of keeping its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a real secret is an empty secret (and empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that everything to know about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a secret that is a secret that is in the public domain; but revealing, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means to take away all power.
WikiLeaks did nothing wrong to Sarkozy or Merkel, but made it too big in Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, no further information will be allowed to upload any reserved information - this would be tantamount to publishing it on a poster stuck to the corner of the street.
But it is equally clear that, with current technologies, there is no point in hoping to be able to maintain confidential telephone reports.
Nothing could be easier than to find out if and when a head of state travelled by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved reports be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the time being, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore novel, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who travel discreetly in diligences to uncontrollable routes, carrying only heart-tested messages or, at most, by hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept in a single copy in locked drawers: basically, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward in crab, that is, let us backward.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet re-established a wire telegraph (telephones).
The (analog) videocassette had allowed filmmakers to explore a film step by step, going back and forth and uncovering all the secrets of editing, while now CDs (digital) allow only to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, whereas by plane, and the journeys that it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that policy and communication techniques should be used by horse-drawn cars.
A final comment.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was going on in the secrecy of embassies.
At the moment, it is the embassies that request confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France shackles its pledges of financing
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to review the timely pledges made by developed countries.
And the big French bids are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries committed themselves to providing USD 30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged EUR 7.2 billion over three years and EUR 1.26 billion (EUR 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU took the lead in persuading its partners to the reality of its commitment to fast start funding: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, large side event, distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation was appreciable and appreciated: developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries doing the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has made EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on the right track to meet its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen agreement, this money must be 'new and additional', in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being to the detriment of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States whose procedure France blocked.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has considered 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years for fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
On the other hand, France believes that the funding for "all new projects" for 2010 is "new and more".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in previous years or at the overall level of official development assistance.
In concrete terms, the total amount of France's support for developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the distribution of grants and loans.
Here again, there is no rule and each chooses its calculation mode.
Some, such as France, consider that a loan is equivalent to a given one dollar.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
While the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often emission mitigation projects based on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro that will be recovered as the equivalent of a euro that is being given... At most, only the cost of the loan to the lending country (equivalent to an interest rate) should be counted under its obligations.
But France has nothing to do with such a reasoning: it 'respects' its commitment of EUR 420 million by making 91.5% loans (EUR 389 million) and 8.5% of grants (EUR 36.1 million) - see the EU document for self-checking.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) live on their commitments with 100% grants.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union put the largest part of the European Union to fulfil its commitment, France is only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice sleight of hand.
In short, in its fast start funding, France is carrying out a double fraud: on the one hand, on the evolution of action over time and, on the other hand, on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, it manages to make it appear that it is spending EUR 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who made the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why the other Member States would continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter on early funding is only a small, short-term issue compared to all climate discussions.
But it could be yet another grain of sand in the huge machine of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its accounting method for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could take forward discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently under discussion): the issue of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans will not be avoided.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
Hope therefore rests with the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Pesticide alerts ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published on Wednesday by Generations Futures (former Movement for Rights and Respect for Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value in relation to the small number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with", bought between July and September the food generally consumed in four meals and one snack in one day by a ten-year-old child in the supermarkets of the Oise and Paris.
These typical meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as sweets, were examined by laboratories for the search for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The assessment of the trim is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as certain carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (PEs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
'Although, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, our survey clearly shows that the reality of consumer exposure to possible carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is a matter of concern,' notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three known as certain carcinogens, as well as about 20 residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as snacks by the study, has traces of six chemical substances, a fungicide still banned in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green beans, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a banned potent insecticide in the EU.
In addition, minced steak, canned tuna, and even bread stick and chewing gum were full of pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to warm the meal in the microwave was not free of it.
The final risk to the consumer of this 'contaminant cocktails' is probably underestimated, according to the study.
The Europe Ecology-Greens/Greens Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed 'facilitated urgency' to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop 'the increase in diseases of civilisation'.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of them in cereals.
