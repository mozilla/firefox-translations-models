Barack Obama will be the fourth US president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth US president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The diploma, medal and cheque for $1.4 million will be presented to him, among other things, for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and will have a busy schedule.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time ever the five members of the Committee who chose him in October from 172 individuals and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple's schedule then includes a meeting with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The visit will culminate in the afternoon during a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, but only the third to receive the award within the Committee's precincts.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would speak about the war in Afghanistan at the award ceremony.
The president does not want to avoid this topic because he is aware that he receives this award by being a president who is fighting a war in two countries at the moment.
He stepped up the war effort just a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, something none of his critics will fail to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check for ten million Swedish kronor (about 1.1 million Euros).
He plans to donate them to charity, but he has not yet decided which ones.
His busy schedule will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant to accept this price at first.
For example, he mentioned feeling that he did not fully deserve it.
He has also repeated several times that this is not a prize for him alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
As soon as the announcement was made, he said it would be a "call to action" for him.
Conservationist accused of blackmail
Police in Litoměřice charged the president of the Litoměřice Society of Nature Protectors Association with blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction site proceedings and demanded money from investors for his personal gain in exchange for withdrawing his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokeswoman for the Litoměřice police.
The president of the Society of Nature Conservationists in Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and faces up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting bins are not up to scratch in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their beverage packaging, while in the villages of South Moravia you come across sorting bins on every street corner.
And in Brno?
There, you would have to take several minutes before finding the right dumpsters.
I do not want to say that waste would not be sorted at all in Brno.
But I have the impression that the city councillors in our city, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the Stone Age of waste sorting not only because citizens can still only sort paper, glass and PVC, but especially because of the number of skips dedicated to this waste.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle in the city center?
It is a whole science, which requires above all time and nerves of steel.
The only place I have found so far is Moravian Square in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues do not blame me, but it seems damn little.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city it is not a sinecure either.
So, finally, many of my friends do not sort their waste.
Out of laziness.
It makes them a trotte to get to the dumpsters.
It doesn't surprise me on their part.
Myself, after a party, I offered to throw a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except that I did not see any dumpster colored on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately I found the right place when I went to take the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing.
It is, after all, the center of Brno, which is supposed to best represent the city, right?!
It is probably that ecology and an alleged aestheticism do not interest the socialists of Brno too much.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first hockey league that shames the city all over the country, instead of buying a few more dumpsters and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I was able to back up my impression with official statistics after hanging out on the internet for a while.
According to data from the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravian region.
Paroubek's budget took money out of pensions and sick leave
After the left has grown, despite the advice of the government, farmers or civil servants, there may be a lack of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on the State's debt or international legal proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they based themselves on the fact that the government would borrow for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "It's just putting off problems, undermining the field," Janota said.
You should know that on borrowed money the interest to be paid is increasingly high and that it will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state has no real choice as to where to draw money.
If he does not cut social assistance or spending, he will have to raise taxes.
To all those whom the left has now increased: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And subsequently, to their children.
People will receive them and need not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of greater state debt - next year there will be no shortage of 163 billion in the coffers, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will grow faster and faster and with it, interest-related expenses.
The state will need money to repay it and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity leave as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
There will also be a shortfall of five billion to complete road and rail construction because of the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly sections that have already been decided and started and whose projects cannot be modified in order to reduce costs.
At most keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major projects, and the withdrawal of European funds is also in danger, according to the warning of Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very cleverly - it will draw on the dividends of the ČEZ (supplier and distributor of electrical energy), which the state owns in large part and will feed the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is by no means a bottomless pit.
Last year, EUR 18 billion was sailed from the ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, the dividends are used to pay for the elimination of ecological damage, to supplement the pension accounts or to serve as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
Moreover, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GNP according to EU rules.
And this is far from the end of the carnival of transfers.
The budget for various compensation for victims of communism and crime, and even housing savings, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international lawsuit, we will have to pay for it anyway," says Janota.
The minister will then have to save on the department's side or, in the worst case, touch the government's budget reserve.
There is also a shortfall of one hundred million euros in the project of a state fund worth two billion, which should make it possible to follow online what are the expenses of each administration.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister does not find money elsewhere, the project will have to be stopped and sanctions will take place, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, the Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another at the touch of a button.
The projects that have been revealed look promising.
All it takes is one button and you switch from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which deals mainly with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can switch between them, you can differentiate them into personal and professional
Both will work at the same time, VMware Company's Srinivas Krishnamurti said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and it was made a first demonstration a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is by no means fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists of a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM of 128 MB, which simultaneously ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now working with European and U.S. carriers to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to the devices sometime in 2012.
Snow shortage in the mountains bothers hoteliers
Deserted slopes are not only a problem for lift operators.
The lack of snow deters people from booking their ski holidays in hotels and guesthouses.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Internet users browse the offers, ask for prices but do not dare to commit to booking for the moment.
And if they call us, they ask right away if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl.Info news portal.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in Špindlerův Mlýn, it is better not to hesitate too much to book.
If we prioritize savings and the quality of accommodation comes later, then we can try to wait a few more days.
Hoteliers in Špindler currently only offer one-week stays for the New Year.
I think they will try to place them for a while, but they too will give in and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandraa said.
The Ingtours tourist agency in Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
The week of Christmas interests us the most at the moment, it is not completely sold.
There are still free, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That's why we have already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourist agency can also offer New Year's Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February start just as well, the remaining winter stays sell averagely.
This year, interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for it to start falling.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes overlap during the week, Christmas will also be sold out," Schiefert said.
Conversely, the occupancy of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last places left for New Year and Christmas.
There is great interest during the January holidays of Poles and February sells well too," says Karel Rada, manager of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central car park in Jánské Lázně is also eighty percent full during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the newest hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupancy at the moment.
February is a little weaker at the moment but as soon as the snow falls, interest in stays in the Krkonoše will certainly grow even more, said the manager of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
Hoteliers in Krkonoše, however, should not expect more snow.
Thursday it will be cooler and if there is precipitation, it should be snowy in the mountains.
But after that, the weather should warm up, says Jiří Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United States: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It even becomes comical, the assiduous effort with which Barack Obama, president with the reputation of sage, reproduces the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, which he himself considered very simple.
When he finally let his long-awaited doctrine transpire, it turned out that he had copied it with carbon paper since Bush's Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not content with using in the text even several times the expression "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate, moreover, to use the title of Bush's speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward".
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements to an Iraq consumed by civil war as "irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of campaign commanders, was the only one possible and likely to succeed to such an extent that the newspapers at present do not mention Iraq at all.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, but objectively speaking, he left his successor with a much more favorable final situation than could have been hoped.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
It was again the field commanders who asked him for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favorable.
The president hesitated for three months but for lack of a better option, he at least defrauded the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to extract the promise of another 5,000 from Europe, even though he originally counted on 10,000.
What brings the most problems in Obama's entire strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and complete this whole process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine raises more questions than it answers.
Many doubt that a halving will bring the same fruits as the advance in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is the exact opposite — no one can be counted on and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing leaders on a day-to-day basis according to what suits them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain nothing more than window dressing behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
Balancing the interests of various ethnic groups is singularly complex given the lack of clarity about the relationship, which is further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "quick state," which is the basic goal of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy is perplexing by its voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and unrealistic heart can be persuaded that the little soldiers sent into the tumult of war for their "speedy return home" will bring about a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will see it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
European politicians do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the tightened sanctions do not have an effect on the Iranians, the Americans will be faced with the very difficult question of solving the problem through the use of military force.
It will have to be answered, for example, at a time when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Each such solution, however, will lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only fuss for Obama is the fact that there are three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for him to work on a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs Bank executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior executives at U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced this in response to strong criticism of its pay practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive shares instead of cash, which they will not be able to sell for five years.
Shares can be withdrawn from managers in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is leading the effort to link rewards with long-term returns on Wall Street.
"I guess Wall Street is well aware of the global meaning that needs to be taken," said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan.
The concern lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will probably exceed $ 20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the onset of the financial crisis, high premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intended to apply a single tax of fifty percent to bankers' bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds.
The France is preparing similar measures.
This year women won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics
A record number of five women received Nobel Prizes in technical disciplines and literature in Stockholm today from King Charles XVI Gustaf of Sweden.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider received with their compatriot Jack Szostak the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry prize was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with her compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have a winner this year was physics.
The award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical glasses.
Each laureate received the diploma, the Nobel Medal and the certificate of acquisition of the monetary award.
This reaches ten million Swedish kronor in each category. (approximately €1.1 million)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the award among themselves.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize winner has already been awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to US President Barack Obama.
The latter, in his speech, acknowledged the controversial nature of his award since he is only at the beginning of his journey and he is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defence of his policy, he added that in some situations war is indispensable to achieve peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is weighing his stay in government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the Chamber of Deputies.
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also Janota's position in cabinet will be on the agenda of their meeting on Friday.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat briefed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his position on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be submitted for Klaus' signature, the Czech Republic would have to manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday approved the left's proposals on money transfers and increased the remuneration of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the Social Democrats' proposals for the fact that they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, a disagreement that calls into question the future of Fischer's cabinet that had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics say the budget, as voted by MPs, scraps Fischer's government's savings package that he says should stem the state's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the state budget law but is not obliged to do so, said today at a breakfast of talks with entrepreneurs that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irreprone deficiency" of public finances.
At present, according to him, there is no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could bring an improvement, if it could rely on a broader consensus of political parties, according to the president.
ODS president Mirek Topolánek said the budget is staggering and that the government should question its future existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, ODS and Greens clearly no longer works.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "drastic verdicts".
ČSSD leader Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the deficit in the budget prepared for this year by Topolánek's former government is staggering and will exceed 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the ČSSD described the ratification of the state budget for the coming year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman to play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film
Despite criticism that the lead roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus - Undefeated will expose the world a lot about the country, its struggles and victories.
The story is about sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman plays the film about the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it was a ninety-one-year-old Mandela who asked him to play him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I told him, "If I have to play you, I should be able to see you personally.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who won an award for his role in Clint Eastwood's boxing drama Milion Dollar Baby has, for example, played the leader of an anti-slavery movement who became a slave himself, a fictional US president, or even God in the film Almighty Evan but never someone alive and as important to so many people as Mandela is.
The former South African statesman was jailed for 27 years for his hard work to end apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning undefeated and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film tells the true story of Nelson Mandela's joint efforts and South African rugby team captain François to unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite rugby players who are among the underdogs in the world.
The South African team would eventually progress to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela's story to the big screen.
I had no other purpose other than to play this role in a way that brought it as close as possible to reality," Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was of course to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be backstage before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake her hand.
"I realized that when I shake your hand, I get back your energy, it is transmitted and I felt like I knew how you feel," he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he has six months to prepare for a role in rugby's tough world.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I rang the doorbell of the house, he opened it and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: 'I look much bigger in the film'.
Despite the differences between the actors and the real-life models, Invictus under the leadership of director Eastwood has received positive reviews and there is even talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of Daily Variety summed up his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well made film."
In film reviews on the rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry only yesterday acknowledged testing an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from Norway's borders.
The launch was still a failure, however, and the "Bulava" missile, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, is gradually becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during the rocket tests did not have the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava did not fly away, or it was damaged in mid-flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as the "missile that does not fly"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th test was initially taking place normally.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was again damage to the aircraft.
It was obviously the engine of the third stage of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij that was sailing below the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired from a moving boat and submerged
This is why the mysterious light over Norway caused by a precisely unidentified flying object was likely caused by a faulty "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot absolutely speak of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket resisted and the damage only hit the third.
In previous cases, the engines have experienced failures on the first stage.
Even though none of the test launches went smoothly, the management of the Ministry of Defense considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and so they still claim that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will even carry ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The 51-year-old Fetisov legend signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will appear in a professional match again at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will lend a hand to his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably make his debut already in Friday's match against Petrograd.
Fetisov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to work out some details on form," said club coach Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will concern only one game.
"I think Fetisov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players," Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the event of his return to the ice, Fetisov becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford and had 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Fetisov quintet, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players.
For the Soviet Union, he won twice gold at the Olympic Games, seven world championship titles, triumphed at the Canada Cup and the world junior championship.
In the second half of his career, he also collected tributes in the NHL where twice he held the Stanley Cup.
He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001.
Hyundai listened to unions and cancelled all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in Nošovice has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency on Monday.
Spokesman Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai plant confirmed this.
However, management still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday worked again this year.
"We cannot give up on our production plan, it is essential, that's why voluntary overtime was offered on Saturday, December 19 knowing that there would be two shifts," said Vaněk.
The Sedmička.cz website reported that the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of Saturday's team.
It will also be awarded a posteriori for the working day on November 28th.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way it motivates its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for extra hours, or they can take a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their end-of-year holidays, Vaněk said.
In addition to this, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and for their lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and hot point in the comments and demands of both unions and workers who spontaneously stopped production last week, management took the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, workers at the auto plant were forced to work two hours of overtime almost daily in addition to their eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the strike state after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the management of the auto plant and the unions is scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to end the state of strike if they agreed on their demands and signed a joint document.
The situation at the plant peaked last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike over incessant overtime.
They were also protesting poor pay conditions and alleged hazing.
Management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work extra to meet the requirements of automobile production.
When the strike was announced on Monday, the unions also demanded that workers who had stopped production not be subject to any sanctions.
The unions are calling on the company to keep overtime time to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year a remuneration of 5,000 crowns (about 209 €) for these.
Hyundai's Nošovice car plant currently employs 2,000 people.
It started mass production last year in November.
It manufactured about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, having a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "enduring" HIV viruses too
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the enhanced substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality prevails, in some cases, over the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
There is currently no cure for AIDS.
However, it is possible to radically prolong the life of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption leads to a series of side effects.
In addition, the repression of this multiplication has the effect of developing so-called resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT in Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metalocarborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are an assemblage of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way than all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers' work leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bonds on virus proteins.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are formed by boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease, there would be no mature infectious particles of the virus.
If we stop the protease of HIV, we will also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, explain the researchers in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic link, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in test tubes as well as on its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarborans is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however it does not weaken on resistant versions against which common drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarborans, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications, are therefore interesting combinations to be further explored in order to move towards the development of effective HIV drugs, says Pavlína Řezáčová, director of the structural biology laboratory at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Genetics.  molecular of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over the budget. The ODS attacks Fischer, who defends himself
The president of the ODS (Civic Democratic Party), Mirek Topolánek qualified the budget ratified for the following year as "appalling" and in his opinion the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister called the ODS's comments a drastic verdict.
He says he takes time to analyze.
ODS spokesman Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether to rely in the Chamber of Deputies on the minority that is concerned with fighting the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned with remaining in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified the budget for 2010 on Wednesday, but with proposals for changes to the tune of 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The House has increased money for civil servants' salaries, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance with the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's wish that a modified budget is a less bad variant than an interim budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer indicated that the government will still reflect on the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota were to threaten to leave office if the proposed amendments were ratified, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment with the prime minister on Monday after his time in government:
At the same time, he indicated that he was wondering whether he would remain in office.
His disappointment with the budget negotiations is the reason for this.
If Fischer decides to continue fighting the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the ČSSD representatives, who imposed the budget changes, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other deficit-increasing laws, such as those affecting health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: The ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is a matter for the head of government Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing prejudicial, Topolánek stressed in a statement from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries claim to be part of TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of fighting against the amount of the public finance deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that he bases himself on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I have not thought about it and once it is on the agenda then I will devote myself to it, declared from the House to journalists, the Minister of Defense Martin Barták, elected to the government precisely by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew out in the afternoon for a European Council debate in Brussels.
The ODS backtracked at the Prime Minister's request.
Nečas stressed at the same time that the ODS would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not expressly asked the Democratic deputies to allow the budget to be voted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not grandchildren, he reacted to the question of whether the ODS had not been reproached by the president of the party in the House or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I did not notice that my vote would have been lacking.
I already knew when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a Bolshevization of the House and a destruction of all that was positive, reacted Topolánek himself.
According to the new ČD timetable there will be fewer trains for identical fares.
Czech Railways will abolish or limit some less loaded express or regional trains from 13 December and will instead strengthen others.
Total transport coverage will decrease by two percent on the day the new timetables come into effect compared to today.
Most rates will not change, including base fares and discounted fares.
For example, it is the inhabitants of the Ostrava region who will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino train.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the direct Prague - Letohrad line will be drastically reduced.
At regional level, the largest decrease in transport is in the Hradec Králové region by a total of eight percent, while Prague and its surroundings can welcome an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also cancelled and the circulation of some express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the biggest transformations, we can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, whose opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
Distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague's main station (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will depart in two-hour intervals.
Travelers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from December 13.
The bill this year for the regional railways: an additional 200 million crowns.
The express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the railways next year a total of four billion crowns to settle visible losses, the same amount as this year. The regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the State will participate to the tune of almost three billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a ten-year contract, until now the duration was always one year.
The railways appreciate the system, which also explains why they have not resorted to a price increase for the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will only affect ČD Net day tickets and eLiška discounted internet tickets.
For travelers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will again depend on the route travelled, whereas until then it was valid between cities in a region of your choice and was at a single fare of 160 crowns.
Philippine rebels still hold more than 50 people, children released
Rebels today abducted 75 people in the southern Philippines, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed it, but originally spoke of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as was one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 rebels are reported to have used the hostages as human shields as they fled from police.
Local negotiators are now trying to reach an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AFP, police first pursued the kidnappers following violence caused during a settling of scores between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in the southern Philippine province of Maguindanao because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre linked to the elections of the governor's administration were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province in the southern Philippines was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, as was his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
The island of Mindanao also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
South Africa's story is about everyone, according to Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in U.S. theaters in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrates part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter went to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody it.
The male supporting role of the legendary South African rugby champion went to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theaters, the feedback of critics and the public is heard.
Nelson Mandela
Full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of thought, in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside de Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains high hopes since it is presented at a time when on the one hand South Africa is in full preparations for the football World Cup, and on the other hand because the media is agitated by worrying news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, reactions to the new film are for the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations expressed towards the main roles where "strut" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is nonetheless, in his own words, proud of the film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and I prepared well.
"I also met Nelson Mandela personally many times to be able to - as they say - recover his energy, he said at the official premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if you have the opportunity to remember Mandela's personality and message through the film.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual, he added.
Wearing the national rugby team jersey
The film based on the story of the novel by British writer John Carlin the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave his creation to the people depicts the South African human rights defender during his term as president.
Morgan Freeman tries during the film to reconnect two racial groups of a population long divided and like Nelson Mandela in 1995 he enters wearing the national jersey of the South African team on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa had won then.
For showing himself on the pitch in a jersey, which is considered sacred in South Africa, Mandela had been given a long ovation fourteen years ago mainly by the white public and was recognized by the white population.
Hopefully the football championship will succeed in uniting people again into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only "black" on the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense South African situation will improve.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain, recently told LN.
The championship began on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region
In the morning, a fire engulfed a transformer of the Čeps company in the distribution centre near the municipality of Výškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, spokesman for the Ústí fire brigade, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer burn, but they revised their notice and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandátova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission assembly.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure can be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced with a new one.
It adds that in ten years of activity, Čeps has not experienced anything similar and that incidents of this type are isolated.
Electricity supplies were not interrupted, says ČEZ spokeswoman for North Bohemia Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of households, administrations and industries was not influenced by the fire at the transformer station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator of 400 kV and 220 kV transmission systems and power lines in the Czech Republic.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution substations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from transmission to distribution assemblies and lines with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jančura to file defamation complaint against three ČSSD prefects
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will today file a defamation complaint against three Social Democratic prefects.
And concretely against Michal Hašek from the South Moravian region, against Radko Martínka from the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesařík.
Jančura indicated this in Dvacet minut of Radiožurnál.
The complaint relates to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain areas.
However, all regions ended up signing long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three have attacked us and claim that we make the fine mouths, when we only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
This is in exchange for slander about the Student Agency company, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
Similarly, he said he had evidence that no region had proceeded in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Hašek considers that Mr Jančura's complaint represents the continuation of his media spectacle which serves as free publicity for his company and for his person.
I am of course willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I assume that this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Jančura who is manipulating public opinion and resorting to false and misleading arguments about regional rail transport," says Hašek.
Jančura already informed last week that he will invest a few million kroner in an advertisement that will mention the unfavourable steps of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he will stop the campaign after Christmas and that he intends to resume it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will target corruption in a broad sense.
Jančura started his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of the rail links for an order worth about 150 billion crowns, without issuing a tender.
According to Jančura, such an action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to threats in Jančura from a ČSSD MP.
The only threat was that if we did not stop, we could lose our bus licences.
He ran as a ČSSD MP, I don't know who it is but I won't say his name," Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will reverse old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voices are already being raised saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are culminating.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines the maximum prices for vaccines that health insurance companies will pay.
Specialists also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated against pneumococci free of charge.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the following vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of vaccine should be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococci.
Yet parents paid 1600 crowns or more for a dose.
Vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Experts estimate that every year health insurers spend 300 to 450,000 crowns on vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would need.
Until now, the State has spent about NOK 500,000 per year on all childhood vaccinations.
Reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococci are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, there are up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions regarding a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
From January, it must be paid by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
His association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we were able to impose at least this.
I think this is a direction that must now be followed," Kalovský said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the process of vaccination against pneumococci.
"We are not considering it at the moment," said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Society of Paediatricians, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its flaws.
If all children were vaccinated, we could envisage a decrease in vaccination renewals "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional," says Cabrnochová.
Experts predict that by next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated.
Vaccination against pneumococci also marks a break because it is the first vaccination of children that is financed by insurance and not the State.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance companies should free up funds for prevention, saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves
However, this is related to the concerns of practicing paediatricians, who concern the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have vaccines purchased by insurance, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the state.
However, some MEPs feared that this would allow insurance companies to "deduct sums from health insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to reimburse them.
According to estimates, individual paediatricians will have to invest almost 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum Theft"
Frank Frazetta's son, a well-known illustrator, has been accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million (£12 million) from his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
She said Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force their way into the museum in the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press (AP) news agency reported.
AP quoted a police official as saying the young Mr Frazetta may have been motivated by a family feud.
According to a police statement, said Mr. Frazetta Jr., 52, claims to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility," the agency reported.
Frazetta Senior denies giving such permission, the agency said.
Labour defends the increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the tax increase and spending cuts announced in the pre-budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, businesses and unions.
The Tories maintained that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing his decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor has also incurred the wrath of his attack on low and average wages.
Among its main proposals, we can see a 0.5% increase in Social Insurance and a ceiling rate of 1% on public salaries from 2011.
The anger of Social Insurance
The unions protested that low wages are being penalized by a recession for which they are not responsible and warned that "problems" were coming.
The reduction in Social Insurance - which will raise around £3 billion a year - has angered the business community, as it is a tax on jobs when the aim should be to revive the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than £20,000 a year, will affect around 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Insurance will increase by another 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will shrink even more than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
The increase in the company's income tax for small companies has been abandoned
Tax rebates for electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person earning £30,000 will lose GBP 90 per year and a person earning GBP 40,000 will lose GBP 190, while a person earning GBP 10,000 per year will earn GBP 110 more.
Ministers said that their objective of halving the deficit by 2013 led to "difficult decisions" but insisted on the fact that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would fall on the first 5% of employees.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms refuted a tax increase and stressed that cutting spending was a "drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These numbers are important. They will allow us to halve the deficit, which will be absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that economic growth would pick up at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecast for economic growth – which will influence how much it will have to borrow and how quickly the deficit is closed – was put in doubt after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his remarks, he said the economy would likely shrink by 4.75 percent this year — far worse than the 3.5 percent decline predicted in April — while borrowing would be 3 billion GDP higher than previously estimated.
'Missed opportunity'
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday warning against Labour's "debt crisis", have said plans to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years are not viable.
Ministers failed to come up with a credible plan on how to repay, they added, "cynically" evading difficult choices until after the elections - to be held in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
"Important announcements will be made after the elections, whoever wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from further cuts, unlike the Tory's proposals that would lead to a faster and bigger deficit reduction.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money raised through higher taxes and spending cuts would be used to support next year's spending and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "built on wind".
Nick Robinson, the BBC's political editor, claimed that the timing of announcements – such as the increase in inflation for some disability benefits next April, mentioned above – would leave the Chancellor facing propaganda accusations, with the money simply being clawed back the following year.
However, Labour insists that more help is being provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Fake budget"
Although ministers did not release details of spending beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that restrictions on government spending would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies has said the Chancellor's figures imply substantial cuts in many areas going forward, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually only postponed," said its director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the election, whoever wins," added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to Deloitte's Accountants.
"This was a fake pre-budget report. The markets are well aware of this."
FBI Investigates 'Arrests of Americans in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American reporters on suspicion of extremist links.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether the same men were reported missing from their home in the US state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. State Department said it was also seeking information on the people.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are U.S. citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are being held," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are missing," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
She said the house was already under guard by local police and no charges had yet been brought against the men arrested.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters news agency reported, but said the U.S. must "work more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing from their homes by their families in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian 'abuses'
Over the past two decades, human rights have been as little respected as ever, according to Amnesty International's report.
The report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the campaign for the June presidential elections.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its lack of respect for human rights.
The authorities have claimed that such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been arrested and dozens killed in Iran, after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison terms and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, the BBC's Tehran correspondent, now in London, says that at the start of the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
'False confession'
Amnesty International has documented the case of a 26-year-old computer science student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the election results.
"They often punched me in the face," he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the losing candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, alleged that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
Iranian authorities have denied the rape allegations, but have admitted that abuses have taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he was locked in a container with 75 others for more than eight weeks in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed to allow Iran's parliament and judiciary to set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response, but said the mandate and powers of these bodies were unclear and the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks in a bid to prevent further protests.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow was used to transform the Bristol venue into a competition track.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowborders competing for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park track, a small jump preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said the view from the top of the track was beautiful but it was quite intimidating.
It's a great view, with all the city lights twinkling below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowborders in the country – real talent," he added.
Awards have been awarded to the best aerobatics - or tricks performed on the track.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be abandoned to melt.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French do not like the headscarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and preoccupied the country for fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book presents a much broader and more ambitious plot.
A good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide France what M. Bozen calls for "Muslim spaces" for 5m-6m Muslims.
He is very good at listening and reproducing debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim get married in a mosque or at the town hall (or both)?
Should evolution and gay rights be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical problems, he argues, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that preoccupy the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab Muslim.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not take the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists interviewed by Mr. Bowen generally agree with their counterparts advocating purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia who today constitute a small portion of Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each side.
He wonders how committed French politicians (and the virulent intellectual elite guardian of secularism is) really to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims have not been spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, he detects a "narrowness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, expeditions and fishing are navigating new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a Thin Layer of Ice," Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the far north, the polar bear.
A connoisseur of the history and complicated politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers proving their worth hunting polar bears.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then a brave 14-year-old midshipman who had only the tip of his musket to fight, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young cubs, captured while swimming alongside their newly killed mother, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the twentieth century, a famous show gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still usually one millionth of the area needed for an adult in the wild. the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore turned green due to the algae that grew in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit Indians on motorbikes use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating glimpse into what the future may be like there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphericists nor oceanographers can accurately report the speed of change.
It's not for lack of trying.
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering voyages gave the first information about the melting of the ice sheet.
Cold War submarines then mapped the landforms beneath it.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but most of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice-dependent system, formed by nets of brackish water pressed as it freezes.

"In a few months, it may be our turn"
Marines, among the 6,000 people who laid wreaths on graves in Arlington
First Class De'Angello Robinson, 19, took a seven-hour bus trip to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to saluting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, from where we are sent, we may be in their shoes," Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If this happened to me, I would want someone to do the same for me, which is why I just try to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on veterans' graves in different sections of Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
Now, continuing an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife, Karen, make the trip every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to hold commemorations honoring military personnel and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on graves at Arlington Cemetery around the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and the memorial site for the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a career soldier who died.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said for her, the gesture was a way to thank those who had sacrificed.
It's a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops," she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extensive hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers chose ancient graves, dating back to World War I and World War II, as well as the Vietnam War, because these are not visited as often as the new graves, organizers said.
The mood was one of optimism, as children played and couples held hands, wearing the fresh pine wreaths on the gray graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red bow tie on top.
Nearby was silence on Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the gloomy mood of today's wars filled the area.
Some people were crying without hiding, others were praying, and families and friends were supporting each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names carved into the stone while others bent over to see the small black and white information cards, sunk into the damp earth for those whose graves had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many tearful mothers at her son's grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio and drove eight hours to pay her respects at the grave of Marine Sergeant Gunnery David Shane Spicer, who died in action in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free... My son paid for it," she said.
"Long after I'm gone, I want someone to remember him."
U.S. citizen arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. citizen who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, the U.S. State Department said.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor can be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous."
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but he has always been denied permissions.
The detention of a U.S. citizen may increase tensions between the communist Brotherhood government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which is pursuing a "soft" approach to improving relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government move forward in concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the U.S. can reciprocate.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country where the average salary of a civil servant is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; They are mainly used for texting or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day's pay.
On the island, internet use is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors to the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to connect often must provide their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, press secretary with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention is a big mistake.
Activity that in any other open society would be allowed -- distributing mobile phones for free -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch, which recently published a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba called "New Castro, Even Cuba," referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader to replace Fidel.  his older brother who was ill.
According to Vivanco, a defendant is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, as the two countries begin to engage in better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization believed to be plotting to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hoped the case would dismantle a large network of terrorist recruiters who scour the internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were hunting a hidden insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments endorsing the terror waves on the YouTube video site on the internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, the men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote region of Pakistan's tribal belt, home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who was briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that the men were not participating in the CIA's plot to infiltrate the terror network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the northeast that have become a safe haven for terrorism.
They were seen as undercover agents.
That's why they were rejected, said a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The official said the men were determined and were still trying to obtain the necessary permits to gain entry into al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law forces.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- emphasizes the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly, in determining who to trust.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the US secret services have made it a priority to infiltrate men into the al-Qaeda network.
The organization's recruiters play the role of gatekeepers, denying entry to those who do not show serious commitment and those who may turn out to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are being closely studied by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups must also be increasingly careful in recent years in choosing who they accept because US intelligence has become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment pattern that so many others have already followed? Kohlmann said.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen demand climate 'action'
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here on Saturday, demanding greater climate action from negotiators working at the city's Bella Convention Center.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a small number of masked activists set off a few explosives near a cluster of government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when little happened during the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched across the city, unfurling signs in English saying "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, declaring "Earth says she's had enough."
Several celebrities joined the protests, including Danish supermodel and photographer Helena Christensen, who said traveling to her mother's native Peru opened her eyes to the heartbreaking issues facing the country due to the impact of climate change already happening.
That's one of the reasons I decided to join the big march -- to spread the word and call on world leaders to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions," she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said they arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said they arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked not to be named because of his involvement in the climate talks, the activists, who wore masks and black clothes, set off several explosives near Copenhagen's main canal, which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They launched them near buildings, he said, adding that they were rockets first, followed by "some big explosions."
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around television screens to follow the march throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters have failed to awaken the conscience of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's climate representative.
Asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English: "Actually, it's something I wasn't aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, declaring "The event being important, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He observed that walking could seem harmful or useful depending on the perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or interfere with the freedom of others."
Test results reveal stubborn discrepancies between breeds
Last week's federal math results report brought good news for Washington D.C. public schools.
While the District still lags far behind the top schools, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are making much greater progress in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between the performance of African Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average results of white children in Grade 4 (cm1) in WashingtonD.C. have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
The achievement gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling only one point, from 245 to 244.
The average blank result was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
The overall picture over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in the Grade 4 (cm1) class, when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District expressed concern that the rise celebrated by Educational Institutions Group Director Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D-D.) was being propelled by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean we've elevated the aggregate by looking at the top, which is problematic and inconvenient," said Jeff Smith, director of the D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equality in District education.
I'm not jumping for joy for one or two points won," said Kwame R. Brown (related Democrat), a D.C. board member whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary School.
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said the message of the test results is that the city's middle schools desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect that.
But the scary thing is that we don't devote enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of struggling students.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the late and early middle school grades who did not integrate the basics of reading earlier in their school career and who are quite behind their peers.
Each day, the math curriculum, for classes from Kindergarten (kindergarten) to Grade 6 (6th) focuses on real-life games and experiences, as they were set up in the District by former chief Clifford Janey, who is also to be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think we need to keep working to provide better interventions for these lower-than-class students," said Rhee.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to elevate the overall results of the system while providing the money and resources for schools with lower results to close the gap.
It's a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education instructor at the University of California, Berkeley who studies city test results.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
So this targeting can have political repercussions that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like other superintendents of schools, she tries to take advantage of the middle class of whites and blacks.
We are focused on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, no matter where they come from, can be assured that their children will be able to get an excellent public education.
Janey, now Newark's superintendent of schools, said in an interview this week that one of the key elements in closing the achievement gap is the length of traditional public school, now 180 days in the District of Washington, to compete with charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with his teachers' union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a "starting point" for another raise in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise for the future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets off and blinks for a moment at the sight of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela's parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
So while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students in the group explored Gettysburg where tuition is $38,690 per year, her attitude was less that of an impressed new student than enthusiastic.
Great That's where I'm going to study! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, as the guide directed them to the entrance of the science building.
Yup, really?" she said thoughtfully, when she was told about the low ratio of law professor to student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh the kids visited on their three-day journey of discovery and now they had fully embraced the message: The question isn't whether you go to college:
The question is where.
While this question still largely arises for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who dropped out of high school or became parents as teenagers, hundreds of thousands also benefit from the college education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "one in five 'second generation' Hispanics go on to high school -- a notable achievement considering that so many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, say the researchers, they pave the way for the next generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study the fighters say they have a natural affinity for school and an innate need to succeed.
There are also many whose parents set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentorship programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college -- especially if her efforts are consistent and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who don't have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, won't help them, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who has studied Latino students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit to Graciela's universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize college preparation programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school and continue through the end of the high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been attended by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry Secures Deals with 10 Foreign Oil Companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its struggling infrastructure in two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by Iraq's Oil Ministry with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are poised to play a major role in rehabilitating Iraq's oil industry, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies walked away with a stake in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday.
The only one who had put a bid lost.
Two U.S. companies were awarded contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of US oil giants in opening up Iraq's oil sector surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an Internet news site.
It will be a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombing on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military troops withdraw have held back U.S. oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with more force, which has the world's third-largest crude oil reserves, analysts say.
U.S. companies were, in some cases, at a disadvantage because of their rivals, particularly the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labor costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they were not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to be awarded contracts with the Department.
The most important United States companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which had strong links and technical advice to the Iraqi Ministry of Oil, left empty-handed.
Russia's Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded over the weekend.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. bid more on contracts than other companies and walked away with significant stakes in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological powerhouse," said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on par with its competitors and realize its commitments in Iraq.
Companies pre-selected to bid made bids that were then compared to the per barrel rate the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of al-Qaeda's main organizers reportedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that a U.S. missile that struck along the border with Afghanistan killed one of the organizers of al-Qaeda's operations this week, U.S. counterintelligence officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles launched into their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside Pakistan's lawless tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, a member of Pakistan's civilian intelligence said, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
Authority officials said the suspicious local activists rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of the "totally shredded bodies."
It was completely impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two US anti-terrorism representatives gave unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of al-Qaeda's military organizers who led the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities, who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of the airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic instructions of al-Qaeda leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second U.S. official said Somali had made rapid progress in al-Qaeda and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the general American public, but that does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, the second official said.
If confirmed, Somali would be the second prominent al-Qaeda figure or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, along with three other operatives.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has decreased since the summer, from about six operations a month to two, according to figures put forward by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a nonprofit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have made progress in decreasing their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site claims.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
U.N. special envoy to Afghanistan Kai Eide said Friday he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of widespread corruption during the UN-backed presidential elections.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase but expressed concern about the US timetable for a troop withdrawal that would begin in 18 months and force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community," Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants assisting Afghanistan's political transition.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning but would simply honour the commitment he made to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement," Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has already begun looking for a replacement.
The representatives claim that the name of Staffan di Mistura has been mentioned; they are an Italian-Swiss citizen who recently chaired a UN mission to Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously headed UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai in presidential elections and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the allegations but said Galbraith's accusations -- who was fired -- "harmed the mission because there was already a good deal of skepticism regarding international election observation."
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate relief efforts for U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries than is allocated to the mission in Afghanistan, saying it would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration over the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying heavy UN hiring regulations hampered his ability to bring in new talent.
The UN rules are such that I have only been able to recruit one person since May," he said.
It is catastrophic and it cannot last.
Gates: Iran must face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that major world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to an audience of 300 US troops in northern Iraq during a week-long visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, played down the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such an outcome.
One of the things that weighs on me the most is that if I've learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it's the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a set of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has signaled that some of these sanctions could also affect Iranians on the street.
He said a "set of motivations and punishments" might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons because "its people would suffer tremendously" from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "likely" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program back into full compliance with the UN Security Council and its watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran persists in saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experiment solely for peaceful purposes.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, it indicated that it would resume dialogue on reducing its nuclear programme and agreed to give up a significant part of its enriched uranium storage, in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration pushed such a deal as a way to build trust on both sides and buy time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have moved away from deal attempts — in part, experts say, because Iran's leadership is divided over whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, Iran's hardening in the face of some of the proposals of the international community that they actually agreed to in early October, has pushed the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to agree on what they had not envisaged, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians.  Gates said.
President Obama has set December 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before it turns to other options, including continuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions."
In a statement Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "baseless allegations" by some Security Council members about Iran's nuclear activities and affirmed that it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers.  "in order to obtain a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region to meet with troop leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly over borders, property rights and revenue sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict to avoid any delays in U.S. plans to reduce U.S. troop numbers from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm Kurdish anxiety about the pending withdrawal. US officials quoted Gates as saying to Massud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you."
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters lecturing them, "Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "One more baby is one more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that the Shanghai Government authorities, alarmed by their city's low birth rate and aging population, radically changed direction this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child; Their reaction was instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We don't have a second left," said Wang, 31, a human resources director who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of notoriously cheeked and spoiled only children, nicknamed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate has fallen from 1.8 children per couple to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in wealthy coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai's registered resident population, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said fertile couples should have babies in order to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a shortage of labor in the future."
Shanghai is about to become "as old — but not as rich, though — as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
Gradual mitigation
Drafted into the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is arguably the most controversial requirement introduced by the communist government to date.
Couples who violate this policy risk paying huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and facing discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese authorities have attributed to police the duty to help the country avoid a trend that is dangerous to its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the execution of this policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced women who were pregnant with a second child to have abortions.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys to girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both men and women are already only children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Peking University's Institute of Population Research, said central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters urging families to have only one child have been replaced with copies of regulations detailing who is entitled to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at their homes and slip flyers under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial counselling to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response has been disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for files from couples wanting a second child after the campaign launches, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
Huinan commune, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai's Caolu commune, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have minimum health insurance and government-given life insurance.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly view the one-child policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
It's true, we are robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the HR manager, said she only wanted an only child because she was one herself. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us."
We're not used to taking care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation company, puts it more bluntly.
For middle-class couples working together, who lower the birth rate, he says, you have to be selfish to succeed.
People in their 20s and 30s grew up watching their parents struggle in the early days of capitalist China and don't want to have that lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from their parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his resume to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are willing to experience it once, Chen says, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to enjoy a higher standard of living, he says.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
UN group has draft plans for emission reductions
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- so far characterized by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- returned to the spotlight on Friday, with the release of a document outlining ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden.  in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as much as it illuminated the path to be taken.
But it was seen as an important breakthrough in time-running negotiations, with more than 100 world leaders arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Drafted by a special UN working group, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to support global warming, in the short and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key questions, including how developed and emerging economies might decrease their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of global temperature increase that policymakers would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Washington Representative of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what UN Executive Secretary-General on Climate Change Yvo de Boer described as "the full picture".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions in 2020 by 25 to 45 percent below 1990 levels, while major developing countries, over the same period, would reduce theirs by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also revived negotiations on Friday, pledging to provide $3.6 billion a year for the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and droughts or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, U.S. representative to the climate negotiation, rejected any discussion that would require industrialized countries to reduce greenhouse gases, compared to the voluntary efforts made by major emerging economies, if they were not funded by developed countries.
This shift is a signal that the Obama administration is becoming tougher on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei said the top U.S. negotiator either lacked "common sense" or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the U.S. would not help China financially to fight global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the world's major powers at stake, flaws have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about rescuing individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the US squabbling over each other's obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that major powers were fighting over who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to hold large emitters accountable for their actions.
It's really a game in which a new economic hegemony is being developed, said Ulate, who is also climate adviser for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they will continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants say the negotiations will lead to at least a political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the European Commission's climate unit, said the action of small island states has "put political pressure on the entire political process", in part because they are now unified and are asking emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The debates became an urgent matter, as delegates focused on resolving most of the outstanding issues before heads of government reached agreement.
High-level officials such as India's Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China's Vice Minister stepped off their plane and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend closed-door meetings and informational conferences, so they could make claims that will be considered over the next week.
The true image of the rally -- in which 13,000 people enter and leave the Palais des congrès every day -- of guitar-playing activists present nightly shows mocking countries they say are betraying each other and that proposals are written and distributed in paper rather than email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the big leagues," said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Policy at Conservation International.
The heavy trucks are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine the Monday syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will blow through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed commuter train will reach 225 km/h, as it runs from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister for Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin commuter train outside London.
He hopes the new service will bring Britain into an international network of fast and reliable trains and link the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
Small lost holes will become thriving suburban towns, business travel times will be much shorter, and switching from plane and car to train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental hazards are likely to put the brakes on Britain's high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be designed within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment may be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also expected to present three options for a larger, northbound high-speed network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are put forward in a Y-shaped configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two at or near Birmingham, with a branch going west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another going northeast, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It looks like this will be the best performance option," said one rail professional.
When this is over, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which won't open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, up from the current one-hour journey.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains of 400m in length and able to carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham route.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given space constraints, it is planned that an existing station will be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should go ahead, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if he starts the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will initially be forced to run off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, maintaining journey times between London and Scotland in excess of three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure a transition from planes to trains, constituting a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay £75,000 loan for Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, the leading Tory MP, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to reimburse the cost of an orangery he built in his constituency home.
The party leader who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of parliament were being "maintained", increased his loan by £75,000 to build an oak extension to his second home, in Rutland.
He had been allowed to charge the taxpayer hundreds of pounds a month for the additional interest.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carries out a control of members' expenditure. Last night, Mr Duncan said the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his riding of Rutland - Melton.
The neighbouring houses were sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor has a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the emoluments office says Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for fun."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to explain the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons Privileges and Standards Committee into its pre-borrowing provisions.
The Committee cleared him last month of any charges of non-compliance, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the legal certainty of the GBP 271,406 loan from his London property to his constituency house which he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a Member of Parliament.
Documents released this week show Mr Duncan was claiming around £1,400 a month in loan interest until March last year.
In April, his applications increased by more than £1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were intended to finance the £75,000 loan.
The RBS variable standard interest rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, unchanged since then.
The latest release from the Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan was still asking for £1,250 in May.
Mr Duncan lost his post as shadow chief of staff in September, after an undercover journalist allegedly filmed him saying members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the spending scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live 'on budget' and you're treated like 'm... e"
He said: "I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small portion, based on what was okay.
And I could have asked for damn much more, but I didn't."
The MP, a millionaire from his previous position as an oil trader, began having to explain his expenses in May after it emerged that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the fees office that it "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a £-shaped hole in Mr Duncan's lawn to protest after it was revealed he had been asking for £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Mr Duncan said: "It was for major improvements, approved both by the fee office and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of evasion or making or using rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It couldn't be sharper or simpler."
Faithful, come and see the Brighton Advent calendar
Brighton's beach huts have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabins for each December day, using Christmas carols as a theme.
The event began on December 1, when visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., each day, with pâtés and mulled wine served for free.
Christmas carols chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest in the diocese of Chichester and director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a church, why do we wait for people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should draw closer to the people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
"The idea for the beach cabin advent calendar came right after a conversation with some friends, over dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experience and represent that through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world for the climate
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police made several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Conference, responsible for reaching by Friday an agreement that could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization on climate around the world, illustrated by these demonstrations, has contributed to make "the political price" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the procession, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed entirely in black, smashed windows with cobblestones and hammers, an AFP journalist found.
Riot police immediately intervened unceremoniously.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to them members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violent small groups that had distinguished themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of activists were arrested "indiscriminately", stressing that a hundred of them "were still held in the street Saturday night "handcuffed and kept in a sitting position despite the extreme cold".
Starting from Parliament, the procession, rather good-natured, took the direction of the Bella Center, site of the negotiations.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to enter.
A stage was set to welcome the scheduled speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrators had come by bus and train from major cities in Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue raincoats, had formed a first rally in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand reparations for the ecological debt in favour of the South," said Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can not continue to say: we have time, said the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that are drying up in Africa, streams where you can walk like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alterglobalist movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, explained that he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no break between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, marched in red, wearing bandanas touting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, rallies of a few hundred demonstrators were also held to demand strong action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, particularly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia elects its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounced a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to take part in this first election after the Russo-Georgian war in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognised by Russia.
Polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
Turnout was 58 percent hours before the close, according to officials from the Abkhaz Election Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates running, including outgoing President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which left several thousand dead, Abkhazia is seeking to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state," Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who said she voted for Bagapch, told AFP.
She was among voters who went to the polling station at a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a pretty white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are installed throughout this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, gave a warm welcome to the Russian officials who came to monitor the conduct of the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support, especially the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations," Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, replied while raising a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Butba, criticises the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, such as the one ceding control over the Abkhaz railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be held within two weeks.
Climate: global protests, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen climate conference, where police on the alert arrested nearly 700 people on the sidelines of a massive demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts until December 18 delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement that should enter into force on January 1, 2013.
Starting from Parliament, the procession, generally good-natured, took the direction of the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage was set to welcome the scheduled speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Moments after the procession left, a group of a few hundred demonstrators, dressed entirely in black, armed with bricks and hammers, smashed windows, an AFP journalist found.
Riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened unceremoniously, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violent small groups that had distinguished themselves in particular at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in the east of the France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was wounded in the jaw by a paving stone and four cars burned near a squat in incidents that led to the arrest of about twenty people, according to police.
We have an eye on extremist groups, warned police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, as police helicopters circled in the sky.
The majority of the demonstrators, who came by bus and train from major cities in Germany, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue raincoats, had formed a first rally in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".

French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no break between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam mobilized several personalities, including Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who were to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and wearing bandanas touting solar energy in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, rallies of a few hundred protesters were also held to demand action on climate change.
In France, the events organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, particularly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
History-geo emerges strengthened from the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
National Education Minister Luc Chatel said in an interview to be published in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography were "strengthened" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory education in scientific terminal.
Now, first-year students will all have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the minister, "we must get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S stream is no longer a scientific sector" but "basically, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L streams cannot remain sub-streams of the S, he continues, stressing again: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals indignant at the absence of history-geography in the final year in technological high schools".
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L'Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French people (69%) disapproved of the government's plan to abolish the compulsory teaching of history and geography in Terminale S. Many intellectuals and teachers have also criticized this suppression, as well as the left and some right-wing elected officials.
On the other hand, the minister added that there was "no question" of removing the philosophy of the Terminale S program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will take at the beginning of the year an eligibility test that will focus on their discipline, then at the end of the year an admission test that will focus on their ability to teach, explained the minister.
They will also follow internships in situation during the year of M2 and will be a first year in front of the students as trainee teachers.
If you add up all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the minister indicates that he will propose "the individual right to training, something that does not exist in national education".
It also reaffirms the plan to abolish school mapping "by 2012".
At Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince on the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the stakes of the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge taken up Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure of the rue d'Ulm.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a series of interventions by experts, fifteen minutes each, filmed and open to the public, noted an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more, explained on the sidelines of the conference Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of this day which takes its name from that given by the students to the fish of the school basin.
We choose about twenty speakers from among the experts in their discipline and we select them for their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel, who spoke without notes, but with the help of graphs, in front of about fifty people.
This is part of our role as scientists, he stressed, hoping that listeners will remember that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
The videos from these conferences will be posted on the school's website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others on a bimonthly basis.
Late payments: anger of prison guards, planned actions
The unions of prison guards on Friday called for a "general mobilization" to demand the payment by the end of the year holidays of bonuses and overtime whose payment has been postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2nd union of guards) asked staff who will not be on duty to demonstrate Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and to "block" them, to "denounce the theft of their dues".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", judging "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "overtime, night bonuses, Sundays and public holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of guards, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger."
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and has not all been budgeted, but assure that the balances will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I am not unaware of the efforts made by the staff for the functioning and modernization of our penitentiary system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I have asked the management of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation born of a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours does not recur in the future, adds Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be meagre, except for management staff benefiting from the famous bonuses of functions and objectives, lamented the Ufap / Unsa, for whom "the budgetary constraints have a good back".
This is a pure scandal, indignant the interregional union FO of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and public holidays if those of October are not regularized in December, ditto for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the funds of the staff, says the CGT-penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, with some less poorly off than others.
But anyway the account is not there, noted the secretary general of Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he's offering "nicer stuff" than the stuff he gets.
US President Barack Obama, who is preparing to spend his first Christmas with his family at the White House, told the "pope" of the small screen Oprah Winfrey that he has a simple rule when it comes to gifts: "I give nicer stuff than the ones I get".
In a special to air Sunday night on ABC, the president and his wife Michelle offer a glimpse of how they intend to celebrate the holidays in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion will be there.
Santa Claus also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, adding that the dog would "of course" have a gift, according to excerpts of the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: "Certainly not, I gave you some cool gifts last year," she teased the president.
Absolutely, he was forced to concede before responding with humor by pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who offered you this?".
During this laid-back, hour-long show with the famous host who was a staunch supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father that he rarely saw gave him at Christmas.
"I remember that time I met my father who came to see us for Christmas and he gave me a basketball," the president said.
It wasn't until much later in my life that I realized he was the one who gave me that ball.
The First Lady remembered her dollhouse on her side.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arranging it around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse," Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday reoperated, RTL says he is in an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was reoperated in Los Angeles because of significant "lesions" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL says that the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was reoperated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors found "lesions resulting from the operation" of the herniated disc suffered in Paris on November 26, said in Paris his press service, specifying that these lesions had "required a restorative operation".
The singer's press service, however, wanted to be reassuring saying that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be communicated within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, partner of the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday would have however been plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he has opened an eye, adds RTL.
Questioned by AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no drain would have been installed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of Parc Monceau for this herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, had been performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic world.
He was not available Thursday evening to comment on RTL's information.
Following the operation he performed on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, for an infection following the intervention.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close to Johnny Hallyday, estimated Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but assured to be "no worried" for the rocker, who is "a fighter".
He called me just before I left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was because flying twelve hours after such an operation is not playable," Mitchell said.
Wednesday night, the producer of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, was reassuring, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "contained".
Mr. Camus had also said he had spoken with Laeticia, the wife of the singer, and did not notice any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on for a "small colon cancer", then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been widely commented. Fans and journalists have noticed the singer's difficulties in moving around the stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Bousquet's first on his favorite distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist at the Worlds-2009 in large pool, won Thursday an international title on a distance he particularly likes, the 50 m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 in short course in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where wetsuits are allowed for the last time saw only three world records broken while we expected a surge.
One was improved by Hungary's Evelyn Verraszto in the 200m 4 medley and the other two by Russia in the men's 4x50m medley relay.
A regret for Bousquet, who was eyeing the world record in the 50m freestyle, of which he holds the mark in large pool (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the 50m freestyle, it was the 28-year-old Frenchman who won in 20.53 seconds in a final where ten swimmers started against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet edged out Croatia's Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russia's Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world mark (20.30) as he had planned.
You can always dream better and in this case, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane suits, which will be banned from January 1.
At the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations finish their epic in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of combinations did not serve this time to the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in large pool this summer in Rome, world records to the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark in the 400m freestyle (3:32.77) but nevertheless won with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russia's Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Denmark's Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give it my all on this race.
I knew I couldn't break a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola sold for 1.5 million USD
A Roman sarcophagus panel that belonged to French writer Emile Zola was sold Thursday $ 1.5 million, well above its estimate, announced the art dealer Sotheby's.
This front panel of two meters long by 63 cm high, dating from the third century AD, was estimated between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and bacchantes, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have bid the most so far, told AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back a few days.
The panel remained in Rome for nearly 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively by the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it part of her bathtub in her Parisian mansion, and at Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council before the accession to power of Marshal Pétain.
There remained a gray area of about fifty years.
While searching the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola estate" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's abortive attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico
Mexico considered Thursday that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the ousted president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied a safe conduct by the coup government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation overnight with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities of carrying out this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arriving in El Salvador on Wednesday to bring back Zelaya, the Mexican government plane left for its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate General of Migration.
The coup government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "resign" and ask for political asylum abroad to grant him safe conduct.
But the ousted president refused, because he wanted to visit Mexico as a guest sitting head of state.
The coup government "experienced a new failure by wanting me to renounce my office (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, about which he has spoken often since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added playing a few chords the deposed president, who has been taking refuge in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy has presented us with a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum request, the Minister of the Interior of the coup government, Oscar Raul Matute, told Honduran radio station HRN on Wednesday.
I am not asking for asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
A possible departure of Honduras will have to be done as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors of Zelaya's departure had mobilized Wednesday supporters of the ousted president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military has strengthened its siege.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government's position.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had grown closer to Venezuelan socialist President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he organized a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled in Costa Rica, he returned by surprise on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested to answer for the offense of "high treason" of which the justice accuses him, according to the putschist government.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected in the controversial election recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted overwhelmingly against Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended higher on Thursday, the figures of the US trade balance testifying to the recovery of activity both of the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced by 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the tech-dominated Nasdaq by 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We have good news from different parts of the economy," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, she tempered, believing that the market was focused on "the glass half full".
Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners said investors focused mainly on the U.S. trade balance figures, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter."
The US trade deficit narrowed in October by 7.6% compared to September, to 32.9 billion dollars.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected the deficit to widen.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, especially for goods exports, which reflects the growth of the economies of the United States' main trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
By contrast, new jobless claims in the United States unexpectedly rose last week to 474,000 claims.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to the lowest in a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.482% from 3.423% late Tuesday and that of the 30-year note to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: hundreds of supporters of the government shouting at the "Ladies in White"
A few hundred supporters of the Cuban government on Thursday shouted at the wives of political detainees gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were arrested.
Forty "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were booed in the street by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they marched to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, an AFP journalist found.
Down with the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" chanted, fist raised, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes agents who had come to "ensure their protection".
The day before, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havanese district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate Thursday for International Human Rights Day were arrested by plainclothes police, an AFP journalist found.
The police forced the dissidents into civilian vehicles, who were booed by government supporters, according to the journalist.
Arrests of dissidents in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Recipients of the European Parliament's 2005 Sakharov Prize, the "Ladies in White" had organised an unauthorised march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", 200 according to the dissidents, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is one of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain in prison.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the pay of their declared enemy, the United States.
In a rare move, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration by pro-government activists against "counter-revolutionaries."
Cuba, ruled by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, including of expression.
A madman kills an octogenarian with a knife and wounds 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
A madman armed with two knives killed an octogenarian and wounded five other people in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at a busy hour, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the aggressor, aged 28, would have hit with two knives and for undetermined reasons, an octogenarian, in or in front of a pharmacy of 85 boulevard Jean-Jaurès, we learned from police sources and witnesses.
Seriously wounded, the old man, born in 1929 according to an official of the Alliance police union, died in hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then attacked a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, in his thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenarian died.
The other injured man's days are in danger, with vital organs apparently being hit, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then felt unwell and was hospitalized "in shock", according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled into the street, still boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He allegedly injured two passers-by, apparently at random: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter seriously.
The scenario remained confusing in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher's knives that he carried on the cross behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, an official of the Alliance union in Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to testimonies collected by AFP, tried to control the madman.
I saw a guy in his thirties with a green jacket.
Three youths tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was strong," said Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Still boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at No. 61, two municipal policemen, including their manager, tried to arrest the armed man and were wounded with fists, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passers-by came to tell me that there was an injured person outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I saw a very large wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later a second person in his thirties arrived, wounded by a knife.
National police officers arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre prosecutor's office referred the investigation to the Hauts-de-Seine departmental judicial police service (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in police custody.
A police source did not rule out that he would be committed to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to subdue him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" like "all the madmen of this species whose forces increase tenfold under the effect of action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for charges to be dropped
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski demanded once again Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States), the abandonment of the proceedings against his client, currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a case of morality of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of "The Pianist", denounced before three judges of the Court of Appeals of the Second District of California serious errors of procedure at the time of the facts, in 1977.
"I call for the charges to be dropped here and now," Hummel said, adding that the behaviour of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was chilling".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has since died -- would have talked, before sentencing, with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which is a serious procedural error.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired", from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared in late September to have "lied" to the author of the documentary.
Should the court refuse to drop the charges, Mr. Hummel requested a trial, which would allow him to present evidence of his case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no dropping of charges could be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, before his sentencing, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old girl.
He has never set foot in the United States since.
Los Angeles County Assistant District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Polanski "has to be there to show up for the hearing."
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that it is possible to escape?" asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "asks for a favor from the court, while despising its authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed that "there are other alternatives to absconding."
Mr. Hummel was not alone in calling for the charges against Roman Polanski to be dropped.
The lawyer for Samantha Geimer, the victim, has also called, once again, for an end to the prosecution.
Recalling that her client can no longer bear to be harassed at every twist and turn in the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26th September in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, pending possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, held back by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a market torn between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the tech-dominated Nasdaq gave up 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm," said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains within narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the release of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "helped improve the market's view of the strength of the economic recovery," said analysts at Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and much more than expected.
U.S. consumer confidence also recovered sharply in December, to 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indexes were held back by a further rise in the dollar, to the highest in two months against the euro, which "pushes down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technology stocks have lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.540% from 3.482% late Wednesday and that of the 30-year note to 4.497% from 4.492% the day before.
The election of Miss World once again in South Africa
After a month of travel through South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World are preparing to cross Saturday the final stretch to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sport or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I have seen so many things and had so many experiences!" exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which is taking place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I couldn't ask for a better country to hand over my crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I am happy to have experienced it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the austral summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss are now focusing on the competition.
India's Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and running in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom have become Bollywood stars.
It's every woman's dream to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown," says Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional costume and of course in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by a TV presenter, Chinese Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee official Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is difficult to match, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
As last year, the candidates went on safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
Unusually, they also met with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Not common for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their fondest memory will undoubtedly remain the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've dated people I never thought I'd be able to approach.
I will definitely come back for the 2010 World Cup, enthuses Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news of Johnny Hallyday "are very positive", according to his son David
The news of Johnny Hallyday "are very positive", assured Friday his son David upon his arrival at the airport of Los Angeles where he had to go to the bedside of his father hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, it is going very well, said David Hallyday to the press as he got out of the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13:00 local (21:00 GMT).
The son of the singer, looking relaxed, assured that he would go "very quickly" to the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be reoperated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday because of significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles where their daughter Jade is schooled, to attend a school show, said an AFP photographer.
The head of orthopedic and trauma surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would go Monday to Los Angeles to visit the singer.
The producer violently implicated Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, Camus said.
"I've heard about a possible upcoming court proceeding," he said.
Jean-Claude Camus estimated that Johnny Hallyday had "left much too quickly for Los Angeles, with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon".
"I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it stunned me, given that I had two herniated discs myself," he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer had apparently "left without drain, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic community.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma following a cerebral hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulphurous reputation, convicted several times by the courts, in medical liability cases, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of the order, and who is "far from recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He said the operation went "perfectly well" and that post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the installation of a drain," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been multiplying since this summer, seems to be in brackets.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, editor's note) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF association raises its voice and calls on the New Centre to stop using its acronym
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, reacted Friday to the attempted takeover bid of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former Giscardian party, by putting him on notice not to use it on any medium, under penalty of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after reaching out to the left.
The Minister of Defense, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (former UMP switched to the NC) who claims ownership of the UDF trademark for having been the first to register it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday evening, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to be dispossessed, came out of its silence to launch a formal notice to the minister and the deputy, urging them to no longer use the acronym and to transmit to them the ownership of the brand, under penalty of prosecution.
In recent days, you have multiplied the declarations indicating that you were going to propose to your political movement to +take back + the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the board, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also saw fit to follow on your militant material and on the cover page of your site, the name of this movement, the +New center+, with the slogan +the UDF of today +, also note the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to the use of this acronym, explains the office of the UDF which puts in formal notice the NC to remove "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium as well as (its) website".
It also asks Hervé de Charette "to transmit the ownership of (the) brand to its legitimate beneficiaries".
If you did not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they specify that the UDF "has been a political movement in its own right since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and to create an office responsible for defending "the material and moral interests" of the party founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, continues the office, "when he filed the trademark", he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but to the UMP.
He scandalously and fraudulently takes advantage of the absence of filing the acronym UDF to carry it out on his behalf.
This indelicacy, they denounce, before ironically on the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for oneself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled."
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as accused by the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenarian to despoil part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, an offense punishable by a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear each other apart while holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th Criminal Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87, should be conducted collegially by three doctors.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, at least not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre prosecutor's office during the investigation.
The designated physicians on Friday will have to submit a report before March 10, 2010, saying in particular whether Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness and at what times.
I think she will abide by it.
I will talk to him about it, said at the end of the hearing the lawyer of Mrs. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady who must be protected, he said.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist jack-of-all-trades, whom she accuses of having taken advantage for years of the weakness of her mother to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or paintings of masters.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-time friend.
While the court had to examine the admissibility of the action brought by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the pleadings of the lawyers sometimes turned to the big family unpacking Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer referred to three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I have never been able to talk to her since her marriage."
For its part, the Nanterre prosecutor's office again considered that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially since a guardianship judge refused in recent days to grant her request to open judicial protection proceedings for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to take legal action, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would rule once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Managerial revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain...
For more than ten years, the attitude of the management of large companies towards its employees, recalls the position of companies vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of making employees adhere to "values" determined from above as it was formerly a question of imposing on consumers products designed by the technicians of the factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put market conquest strategies back in the right place. Although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from customer preference factors comes back regularly!
A demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, even more, economic intelligence.
Indeed, EI "demands of all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; It requires a commitment on the part of employees that the recipes of authoritarian management totally contradict.
This is why we are calling for a managerial revolution that would consist of putting employees at the center of the company's concerns in the same way as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls
Will internal opinion polls – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – encourage this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I am afraid not.
- Firstly because I have been able to observe that, faced with a new situation, any structure finally arrives, after many detours, to do as a priority... which she has always done. !
- Secondly, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Coming from engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by American "neuroscience" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by research institutes and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to use the "levers" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos survey published in Le Figaro.fr reinforces leaders in a posture of mechanistic governance, unsuited to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies presupposes the adoption of a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating, in any reasoning or governance practice, a fundamental observation: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to realize part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from Motive Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life projects.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resources management "in place".
They thus create a favorable ground for the concerted development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: 'Just war' earns right-wing praise for Obama
The American right on Friday welcomed the speech given the day before in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives, who had ridiculed the awarding of the prize to Mr. Obama on October 9, applauded this time the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, former vice-presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said," Palin, the face of the Republican Party's right-wing muse, told USA Today, adding that she herself addressed the theme of "sometimes necessary" war in her memoirs that have just been published.
War is, of course, the last thing in my opinion the Americans want to have to do, but it is necessary.
These terrorists must be stopped there, she said.
Obama, who inherited both wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way of explaining his decision to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I thought the speech was really good, said the former speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential remarks.
In some ways, I found this speech quite historic," Gingrich told "The Takeaway" radio show.
The former congressman, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen "a left-wing president" remind the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not give a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush turned columnist at the Washington Post, Mr. Obama gave "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke like an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a bubble of security that they did not create and that they do not do much to preserve it", said Mr Gerson.
Among the few on the right who aren't convinced, a Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "dull, ampoulated and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
To the president's left, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When war is wrapped in the notion of justice, one can easily justify the slaughter of innocent people, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained complimentary of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called his speech a "blockbuster" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," the Californian daily said.
Mr. Obama "gave the right speech," said the New York Times, calling it "both dark and edifying."
Rover Scouts: Three marathons for a deal that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiating sessions, the road sector unions and TLF, the only employers' organisation to have stayed until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that puts an end to the strike slogan and the threat to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "delighted" by this agreement, after several sessions of negotiations, started Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators parted ways in the early morning on Friday, with the hope of quickly signing the text of the agreement by late morning.
And this even if three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting that started at 11:00 for everyone to agree and for the text to be signed by 18:00.
The conflict "would have been very damaging for businesses" and "it was feared that it would disrupt the holiday season," Bussereau said.
The text provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In hourly rates, for low wages, "we go from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but we start from very far, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we will give the order to our militants that there are no blockades, no blockade of the supply centers.
But you can always have a few recalcitrants who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", even if it was "difficult to concede increases on high salaries given international competition".
According to him, the increases will be of the order of 170 euros monthly for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke of "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the revaluation of travel expenses by 3%, and the holding of general reports on road transport in the first half of 2010, which will notably address the issue of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "a decrease of 100 million euros in employers' contributions" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending finance law for 2009, voted on the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote it "in identical terms".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply initially to companies that are members of this organization, and secondly, to the entire profession, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done "as soon as possible," Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers' organisations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "fool's bargain", because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate urgently, not at the conclusion of a shared analysis, but so as not to upset the turkey eaters of the next New Year's Eve, lamented Unostra.
For Otre, the agreement risks "digging the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disruptions this weekend, unions unhappy with RATP proposals
Disruptions on the RER A, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue over the weekend, while a meeting Friday on the 2nd day of strike between unions and RATP management left them hungry for their request for a bonus.
On Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will only be trains between 10:00 and 20:00, at the rate of one train out of two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train out of four outside the central section.
Interconnection with SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Préfecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, which expects 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is making efforts to serve department stores".
The RER A crosses the Paris agglomeration from west to east.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one train out of two ran during rush hour, and almost no trains during off-peak hours, as planned.
As on Thursday, there was no crowd on the docks, the Ile-de-France residents having organized.
Thus in the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially because of the absence of middle and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he got up "an hour and a half earlier, to be sure to arrive on time".
The Saint-Lazare station has not experienced saturation, said the SNCF, which had planned a supervision of agents and police.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left from the Saint-Lazare station to join the metros.
Further general assemblies of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, deemed "meagre" by the unions, of a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, working time, career development etc.
This is not what drivers want, who claim a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its bonus proposals on hold, indignant the CGT, stressing that the management "was not damned to solve a problem while among the truckers and the SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for "a broader examination of the conditions of exercise of the profession," said the RATP.
This also made the unions say that the company "made fun of weekend users".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a works committee at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the management, which until then had refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "for the sake of appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to spread to the RER B on Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
The unions are demanding a bonus of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros including 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to the million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second half of their career, receive from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros in bonuses, for staggered schedules, Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish judiciary dissolves pro-Kurdish party, decision with far-reaching consequences
Turkey's Constitutional Court on Friday dissolved the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry protests in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision is likely to greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "hotbed of activities detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", President of the Court Hasim Kiliç told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's cadres, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Ms Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's assets.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without labels.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party maintains however that it has "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court's verdict comes as the government has reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, in an attempt to dry up Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders had said a dissolution could lead to renewed tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where numerous protests against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
As soon as the court was announced, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP offices in Diyarbakir, the large city in the south-east populated mainly by Kurds.
The security forces fired tear gas canisters and used water cannons, while demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails or stones, with slingshots.
A hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Turk said the court's decision would "deepen despair."
Turkey cannot solve this issue by banning a party, he told reporters.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of parties.
It solves nothing, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
The move is a total torpedoing of the democratic opening launched by the government, political analyst Ahmet Insel said.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snows can fall
What Wolfgang Brauwburger wants is a harsh winter.
But the head of the road clearing and sanding service (FES) makes it clear that this is not to annoy citizens.
This is simply so that the agents can test the technique of the vehicles and learn to master them well.
And according to the meteorologists, it could well be for this weekend.
More than 300 officers and 120 vehicles are ready to tackle snow and ice.
The ESF follows a very elaborate plan here.
Brauburger explains that as soon as it starts snowing on the city of Frankfurt and temperatures drop below freezing, large blasting vehicles travel 20 main routes (called A routes).
This includes busy streets, main arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire service accesses, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as Atzelbergstraße.
FES officers start their shift at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometers of roads must be salted with a road fondant that adheres well, in 3 hours of time maximum.
This is why the FES service starts at 3am "so that the roads are clear when the daily migration traffic begins".
Where it gets more difficult is when the snow starts to fall at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, says the head of the road clearing and sanding service "because no motorist is willing to let salting vehicles pass".
Then, if it is no longer snowing, access roads and service roads - such as Rat-Beil-Straße - are taken care of.
Side lanes and side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger knows that this always causes some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES pedestrian team sets out to clear priority areas deemed dangerous and passages.
As for cycle paths, the FES services generally cannot deal with them.
Mr Brauburger points out that there is a special service in Frankfurt which monitors the condition of the bridges between 10 p.m. and 4.30 a.m.
As ice forms very quickly on these surfaces, salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
The police may also call on this special service when needed.
The birthplace of dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 2 meters long and 1.50m high, its hind limbs were powerful, its elongated skull had sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended in sickle claws and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would not have been exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues report in Thursday's Science magazine, Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs to feature these morphological features.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at the time was part of the land surface of the supercontinent, Pangea and was located towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says the discovery of Tawa sheds new light on the evolution of early dinosaurs.
Indeed, it informs us about the ties of kinship, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
In 2006, Sertling Nesbitt began excavations with other paleontologists at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the excavation team says they sometimes found a dozen bones in a day, which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating back to the Triassic.
Scientists quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
Excavations uncovered the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories concerning the early evolution of dinosaurs.
Researchers named it Tawa after the word of the Hopi Indians for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is a truly exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare and limited to a few incomplete bone fragments.
Not all paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery particularly spectacular, but he says that it confirms certain theories concerning the early evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the earliest dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, when saurians split into three major evolutionary groups: theropods (carnivores), which include the tyrannosaurus and velociraptor that appeared later and from which birds descend, sauropods, quadrupeds with long necks, and those related to them and ornithischian herbivores including species such as triceratops and stegosaurus.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first theropods.
This species has an interesting ratio of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers have found evidence that Tawa hallae has small air sacs in its bones at the skull, just like birds that are descendants of theropods.
These small air pockets make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It seems that in Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air sacs in its bones.
Since the related lineage of the huge sauropods also possessed air sacs and light bones, it can be assumed that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
Since the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in South America, researchers concluded that saurians appeared there.
As a result, the three major evolutionary lineages divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, i.e. all the land masses that formed the supercontinent Pangea.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor that would have migrated, the researchers argue.
Alan Turner of the Museum of Natural History in New York and co-author of Science Studies magazine says there have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says there is an even older species, the silesaurus, which lived in present-day Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a mistaken view because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while there are hardly any on other continents.
On the other hand, how dinosaurs managed to become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era, when they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, remains a mystery today.
In the Triassic period, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of present-day crocodiles and many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic dinosaurs spread all over the planet thus favoring the development of many new species while others, which were related to them, disappeared between the Triassic and Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a mass extinction in which dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or, dinosaurs were better adapted and so they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favored the flourishing of a group of animals that had also developed during the Triassic and that since that time vegetated in the shadows: it was mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are those of professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are lecturers from the University of Naples, Quebec City, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police evacuation of Frankfurt's J.W. Goethe University casino is making waves across the globe.
278 professors and lecturers from the J.W. Goethe University as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protesting students at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they condemned the police intervention called for by the university's board of directors.
Last week, University President Werner Müller-Estler evacuated buildings occupied by striking students and teachers after walls and artwork were smeared with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories consider that the damage did not justify "such a violent intervention by the police commando against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
The evacuation represents an "unacceptable infringement" on freedom of research and teaching.
Focusing attention exclusively on acts of vandalism only serves to "delegitimize and criminalize the protest" and tries to obscure the reasons for the mobilization.
The University's Steering Committee has thus withdrawn from the debates that would be essential.
The lecturers demand that criminal proceedings be immediately suspended.
The majority of occupants did not take part in the damage.
Legitimization of protests
The young people of the Verdi service sector and the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
The protests are just a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional youth secretary of the Verdi union.
As for the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took up the cause of the action taken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the premises is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden regional parliament last Thursday during the Aktuelle Stunde TV show.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism," said CDU MP in the regional parliament Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the opposition SPD, the Greens and the Left (Die Linke) did not share this opinion.
The CSU is using a few painted walls as a pretext to criminalise protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Linke).
Instead of thinking about the students' arguments and demands, they are evacuated.
The Left Party has tabled a motion calling on the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new "Silicon-valley"
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under Soviet rule, a place of secret weapons research, under strict surveillance.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet "Silicon Valley".
Important places of production and research in micro- and nanoelectronics are located there.
As early as September 2008, representatives from Zelenograd established links with Riedberg, the place of science in Frankfurt – with the academic institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There have been reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Protocol of Close Cooperation".
The signatories were Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of the Frankfurt project section.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will enable FIZ companies to enter the growing Russian market.
Russian scientific societies, on the other hand, want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and societies.
It is home to the Moscow Institute of Electrical Engineering, the major firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The commune was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") takes its name from the forested hills in the heart of which the research centers are located.
The S21 project: a brake for Stuttgart
The scale of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be set high enough.
For its supporters it is nothing less than "the new heart of Europe".
If you will. S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, into a desperate chaos of construction sites for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 80s.
The head stations, with tracks that ended in the middle of the city, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of nineteenth-century transport technology that acted as a brake shoe of modern rail traffic because it once took a long time to move locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that's what you have to do.
That is why the head stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart too: a passing station for trains, which is about halfway on the Magistrale Trans-European Rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realization of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners acknowledged that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
To tell the truth, the stations at the head of the line no longer pose any real problems of entry and exit since there are modern, reversible trains with railcars and pilot car at both ends.
However, the construction of Stuttgart 21 is now underway next to the new route of the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and communal policies prevailed.
The railway company is on board because it is the taxpayer who bears the brunt of the risks of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public company.
From an urban planning point of view, this project can be justified relatively well.
The result is an urban space that – if we believe the graphs of the computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The passing station and the widening of the section are designed for human trafficking to which - and this is typical of the 80s - a huge growth was attributed.
At the time there was no competition from cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on increasing freight traffic, because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than lorry transport on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros are going to be swallowed up in the Swabian project.
That is the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion is more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be lacking for other junctions and bottlenecks in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport lists a total of sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the widening of the section through the Rhine Valley by a good 180 kilometers.
Since 1987 this line has been built at idle.
It would be really urgent to press the mushroom all the way here.
But the S21 project has the effect of a braking shoe.
The Rhine Valley route is becoming the bottleneck for international freight traffic in the heart of Europe.
Government reviews airport ruling
In the Wiesbaden regional parliament, the Land government raised the possibility of appealing the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court concerning the ban on night air flights.
Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had appointed experts to examine from a legal point of view the judgment handed down by the Administrative Court, which is a document comprising more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Court had justified in a written document that the Land would have to adapt the regulations concerning the ban on night flights in the event that the project to build the north-west landing runway at Frankfurt Airport was carried out.
The authorisation to land for 17 aircraft between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the state government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night-time air pollution.
The coalition must have decided by 4 January whether it wishes to appeal in cassation against the ruling.
The opposition criticises this delay and tries to put pressure on the government representative to drop the appeal to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD parliamentary group leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel is calling on the CDU and FDP to return to their promise made before the elections to ban night flights. Otherwise, it will be considered a total breach of a given word.
It's damn hard to be allowed to keep your word," Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the FDP's election slogan "We keep our promises."
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's reproach that the Land government is still trying to allow night flights using "avocassery and rubbish".
It takes time to do an accurate legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision based on a "quick first impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The opposition's interpretation of its faction's statements on the ban on night flights is completely wrong.
U.S. banks repay aid
The big American banks, badly affected by the crisis, are divesting their links with the State.
Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully repaid the Treasury $45 billion (more than 30 billion euros), corresponding to the aid granted as part of the Tarp rescue plan.
The American television channel CNBC said in a report that Citigroup was also considering repaying the aid received.
Banking institutions are thus seeking to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of sums, such as limiting bonuses awarded to managers and paying higher fees.
Bank of America launched a capital increase through the sale of securities to investors that brought in $19 billion in new money.
The rest of the sum comes from the bank's coffers, which are well filled thanks to the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked American taxpayers: the injection of capital has helped considerably to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capabilities by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
Citigroup is also considering raising money on the financial markets in order to free itself from state supervision.
The US bank could launch as early as Thursday a capital increase of $ 20 billion, reported the CNBC channel citing banking circles.
The Citigroup spokesperson declined to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
In the end, everything went faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the dismissal of the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German broadcaster ZDF, the successor has already been appointed.
The commission wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who heads the Berlin editorial board of ZDF, was the big favourite.
However, the channel did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that there was also the desire not to further harm ZDF steward Markus Schächter in the event that the proposal was not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 out of 14 Commission members.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of writing of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract by five years, but this was rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had declared themselves in favour of Brender's reappointment and 7 others had voted against. Brender's impeachment by vote represented a bitter failure, though predictable for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which has a majority on the Board of Directors, had already hinted several weeks before the vote, that it did not want to reappoint Brender to his post.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse, who organized a league against the editor.
He refused to allow the contract of the esteemed editor-in-chief to be extended, citing the fact that the viewing rate of ZDF news broadcasts had declined under Brender.
This is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, castigating the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
In the end there were even 35 public law experts who had interfered in the debate and believed that Koch's way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it was useless.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked for Südwestfunk (radio in Rhineland-Palatinate) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German daily newspaper with national reach).
In 1983 he became editor at ZDF, first of all at the news magazine "heute-journal" (today's newspaper).
Then his career continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was the assistant editor-in-chief of the time; then correspondent in Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (bimonthly news program presented in the morning); until 2001 he was head of the foreign policy department of ZDF and then head of the Berlin editorial board.
After Brender's disgrace, when he had just been elected journalist of the year by the specialized magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opponent on the board, Rhineland-Palatinate Minister-President Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty so that the intendant's personnel proposals could not be blocked by a biased political majority.
However, Beck does not plan to call for the removal of political figures who are members of ZDF's supervisory committees.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor, had cleverly maneuvered with the Board by vehemently criticizing the commission in its decision to fire Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to nominate him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, just as the Board of Directors could elect him without being suspected of placing a political partisan in the position.
In the arithmetic representations of parties, Frey is classified as a left-wing liberal.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Rectors' Conference, an agreement was reached stipulating that the working conditions of Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to lighten the burden of examinations: a single examination should make it possible to close the chosen study module.
In addition, the workload will have to be redesigned to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions want to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also undertaken to organise more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor's and Master's courses.
At regional level, there must be no different regulations from one Land to another.
Fewer exams
Since the start of the student protests last June, the Ministers of Education of the Länder and the rectors of universities have constantly had the buzzword "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on a concrete meaning.
The accreditation council has decided to considerably reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module should normally be able to be concluded by a single examination," reads a document of about thirty pages on the future conditions of admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Council, said that significantly reducing the burden of examinations should help to stop slippages, which were significantly detrimental to studyability.
Moreover, "studyability" should be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies in the future.
The modules as well as the background must be carefully examined to see if we can avoid this feeling of suffocation that we sometimes feel in the choice of courses.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and flexibility to enable and foster personal initiative".
The new regulations will concern access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on the accreditation councils set up by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exerted some pressure on the Länder to put pressure on the agencies so that the curricula were not too busy and the examination regime not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and colleges of applied sciences have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only Land to have agreed to allocate more resources to the development of the Bologna Process.
With these funds, universities are to organise tutorial programmes and strengthen the teaching guidance offices as well as the examination offices and the international relations service.
The Länder and universities have a budget of EUR 10 million for this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wanted to table an amendment to the law on higher education institutions in Parliament.
After that, it will be necessary to pass only one exam to complete his studies.
The organisation of studies will have to be more flexible, in addition it must be possible to guarantee the recognition of transcripts from other higher education institutions and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all university cycles will have had to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the issue of study conditions in the country.
The decisions were appreciated but critics were heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students said that he would like the organisation of education policy not to take place in future "behind the closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as concerned persons should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Delegates of the Rectors' Conference (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of the students is very useful to us," she said on Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW), the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the right and the possibility for each graduate Bachelor to enrol in a Master's cycle.
Andreas Keller, member of the GEW Executive Board, also calls on the Länder to assure today's Bachelor students that tomorrow there will be enough places for Master's studies and study conditions that are as good as possible.
The Länder must therefore hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of easing access to the Master's degree.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
It is with these words "Arrived in Germany and it's beautiful, almost more control... " begins a work by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he thematizes in disturbing snippets of sentences, the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany who won freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later a collection director in a children's publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner has received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the coveted chair of poetry at the Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm Artist's House in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of headlines in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files".
Visibly unsettled and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to fellow German-Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Securitate political police.
Söllner received in 1989 the German Language Prize together with some of the participants.
Enlistment trials had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, Söllner concludes, "therefore someone who has not sufficiently resisted the Securitate's attempts at intimidation."
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize honoration for Herta Müller and her exemplary literary quarrels with the mechanisms of power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abyss and baseness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as current knowledge can tell, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own Securitate dossier, IM Walter played a role, writes literature scholar Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, and he refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded on his behalf.
"He was able to pull him out of all the difficult situations at the time," Markel said.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and in front of this audience was unexpected, however the admission of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret service is in fact, not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for Securitate spies, Herta Müller wrote in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of her own dossier.
It can be assumed that the victims will have made speculations and will sometimes have guessed which real names were hidden behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike Germany, where in the meantime consultation of Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused.
Systematic clarification has been repeatedly thwarted and slowed down in past years.
It was not until 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the archives of the Securitate (CNSAS) but the restitution of the files has rather dragged on since.
Since 2005, there has been a law defining the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great is confirmed by the interview with a former official of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, spoke very dismissively towards the laureate.
She had psychosis, and in the end she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power thought it could be expressed here, without any gene, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Certainly, many inescapable questions are associated with the Söllner case as so often happens in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who was robbed? The balanced reaction of the listeners, to Söllner's admission, gives hope that the rest of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Uproar in the Champions League
It looked like a rep was coming in, coming straight from a cool Christmas party, on which the sporting goods manufacturer had spread its wares when new VFB trainer Christian Gross climbed in a Mercedes C-class at a quarter to midnight, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier in hand.
The man, whose bald skull attracted attention, allowed himself to be led into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our fifty-year-old could have driven himself – he hadn't drunk alcohol and he wasn't drunk with happiness either.
He had had a pleasant evening but tomorrow we had to go back to work.
Because now was the time to start.
The words of the Swiss who had just been hired three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth final", that is to say in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania" but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight not to fall back."
The "big job" awaits us on Sunday.
Here, it is a question of repeating in Mainz the results of the Champions League on a daily basis.
And it will be necessary to overcome the weaknesses that resurfaced after the three quick goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Prize draw
The eighth leg of the Champions League (first leg 16./17. + 23./24 February/ second leg 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn on the 18th. December in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel's successor's fulminating inauguration was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not moderated only in the one who had brought luck, who had transmitted to the professionals of Stuttgart destabilized, a flawless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I advised them to be braver, explained the "plumber of souls" – Gross – the recipe for success that sounded so goodbut no longer worked with the healer Babbel.
He set off a certain magic, admitted Jens Lehmann - a supporter of Babbel - "in football when there is a new impulse sometimes things happen that we never thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of break due to injury, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" seen by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of the new leader: "He is someone who takes action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
But apparently Babbel had run out.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the course, warns manager Horst Heldt
At the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs tenacity above all.
Like Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overestimate the victory against a totally overwhelmed and weakened defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having a bad awakening four days later in Leverkusen with the 0-4 , Khedira objected.
Horst Heldt, the manager, pointed out that they had achieved one of the objectives of the season but that there were others that were still a long way off.
We have not yet passed the difficult course.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday doesn't have the heart to celebrate, even after the first home win in three months, is due to the events of the weekend that a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann bounced just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and Jens does not, Heldt countered, in response to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He accused management of poor style and said they decided to change coaches under pressure from pubertal fans.
Lehmann also saw it as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his free day after matches had been taken away from him.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt said and foreshadowed consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were no longer in danger of becoming lifelong friends with these two forty-year-olds.
In any case, they agreed on everything else, that is to say that without the prior work of the group by the replaced coach, the strong sporting and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "largely successful," retorted Heldt and Lehmann in chorus – and even the man with the plastic bag nodded.
World Heavyweight Championship
Hot fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly verbally and gesturally provoked the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his title of world heavyweight champion according to the version of the WBC federation.
By unanimous vote of the judges he won the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his World Heavyweight Championship.
The WBC federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a victory on points at the judges' unaminity against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko defends his title with honor since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had already won the WBO and WBC world championship title twice.
Unfortunately he did not pass the long-awaited knockout.
Klitschko, a 39-time winner in 41 professional fights, had to admit defeat twice due to injury.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Bern Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted above all to dictate the fight, from the top of his 2.02 meters, by his left counter.
Johnson, eleven centimeters smaller who, before the duel, had heralded the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the champion's blows, thus preventing Klitschko from bringing his dangerous counter-right into play.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to get through the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his blows rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, to have exceeded with Klitschko the distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko calling him a "nasty zombie" who "is not really capable".
During Friday's weigh-in, the champion couldn't help but provoke Johnson by knocking his sunglasses off his nose "so he can see his eyes."
Fourth win since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko won again in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had previously had to give up without a fight.
That year, defending his championship title, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
"I just took a hit in this fight and am in perfect shape," Klitschko said of his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together in the family the four most important titles.
His brother Wladimir is a WBO and IBF champion.
But it is the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was scheduled to take place in September.
It seems that his promotion company is now planning to play this match at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack on the opposition: The leader of the Greens' parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused Defense Minister Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz Affair.
The SPD and The Left (Die Linke) parties are asking the Chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After examining the latest information on the Kunduz air attack, the opposition has accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The minister intentionally "formulated an untruth" about the deadly strike on two tankers last September, the leader of the Greens' parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, said Saturday during the news program of the ARD channel "Tagesschau" (the 8pm news).
Clearly, this means that he lied.
The order to kill was given in complete disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That, in essence, is the content of the report available to NATO that was read by Mr. Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the objective of the strike was actually not to destroy the stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or wounded in the US air attack, which was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, SPD and Left on Saturday urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak out as soon as possible in the federal parliament and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his Green Party colleague Renate Künast are of the opinion that Angela Merkel must make it clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Federal Government's Afghan policy and whether the Chancellery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellery has in no way influenced the army's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices were growing in doubts about the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to information from the newspaper SPIEGEL, the information they had given to Guttenberg about the attack on the tankers was both correct and complete.
Officially, they allegedly concealed the existence of the NATO report and hid some inconvenient details from the Minister.
In the entourage of the two senior officials, however, it is suggested that they informed the Ministry of Defense of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein and a report from the military police.
The Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reports that Wichert has in the meantime asked in a letter for clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received a response.
On Saturday, the Ministry did not wish to comment on these accusations and referred to the commission of inquiry of the federal Parliament that would be constituted the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
The worlds of dreams
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only among the mentally ill, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality merge.
As long as these phenomena manifest themselves during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our darkened rooms, we can indulge in the wildest dreams and fantasies without hindrance.
However, the one who, awake, experiences a dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in the mentally ill or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, but sometimes prompts the boundaries between dreams, madness and reality to merge.
A state of conscious awakening, taking the form of a dream, can come in the most diverse forms, in the best case we call visions, at worst madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect stand out, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions occur when the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain - first and foremost dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and achetylcholine - breaks and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts very often manifest themselves during schizophrenic psychosis.
The earthly force of attraction no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dreams.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of daydreaming; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
It was autumn 2001 when Henning T turned into a comic book character.
Its body is two-dimensional with garish colors.
The earthly attraction no longer has power over him, he hovers at the raz of the ceiling.
He feels a blow.
Behind him winged devil creatures, grimacing, mouths bloodied, showing their teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain all over his body.
Thunderous, nasty voices scream, coming out of walls and radio.
He can no longer stand these voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. rips two cables from his stereo, turns them into a loop and attaches it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a cabinet and passes the loop around his neck.
He jumps.
The loop is detached.
Let this serve as a lesson to you, shout the voices in a chorus to tear off his eardrum. "Go to a clinic and get treatment!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last of 2 years, the first of almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: schizoaffective psychosis, paranoid, in addition he is manic-depressive, he takes medication against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives; In psychiatric clinics it is the most common illness after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the people concerned can no longer differentiate between the inner world and the external world, they find themselves in a state of hyper excitement, which makes them suffer hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned in sensations.
Like dreams, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is right in the middle of the situation, everything has a meaning centered on him.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is as in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience a hallucination once in a lifetime.
Unlike dreaming, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis, is fundamentally preserved."
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real setting.
Why our brain does this kind of mess is always an enigma for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to momentarily lose their perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies of twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
The researchers assume that those affected have minute brain damage.
It is assumed that neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what still remains unexplained is how the abnormality of the neural system occurs and moreover the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain heats up.
The crazy thing, says psychology professor Erich Kasten from Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and illusory image phenomena for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The unreal world in our head".
Hallucinations are part of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses but also of an impressive number of many other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising to find that under certain conditions even the brains of healthy people are prone to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions, are overactive or not sufficiently restrained; When our brain heats up but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state just like brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimuli, stress, heartache or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of participants admit to having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and she goes to high school.
A very normal girl actually.
If it weren't for the pictures and voices.
During recess, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long chestnut hair, speaks to him.
When she answers her classmates look at her, astonished – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think that this shy girl is a moody dreamer but Sarah K is not dreaming, she is sure.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She may even perceive his presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young person friendly.
Am I crazy?" she sometimes wonders.
But she knows that this young person and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are, in general, frightening.
Often the visions are heavy.
When she is in class, sometimes she cannot follow the class because the teacher is just introducing a new student in his eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is obviously explaining equations on the board.
At night the apparitions are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that comes too rarely and far too late, she often cannot distinguish if she is awake or already dreaming, if the images she sees, the grimacing faces or the girl with bloody gashes on her arms and legs are in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she shouts to these creatures.
She doesn't tell her parents or friends, they would think she's crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She graduated last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact via the internet with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the likelihood is high that they will hallucinate after a while.
I guess the brain is not busy enough, so there is animation.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she had called daddy, since she was old enough to think, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for actual impressions and noises, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to tell the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience," according to Kasten, "takes place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, nocturnal dreams are also a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That's why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a special talent.
There is only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our overly consciously centered world, we unfortunately quickly tend to mistake imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious illness, painful but also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called dreamlike form of experience, a particular form of modification of consciousness awakened by dreaming.
Dreamlike experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is awake.
The dreamlike state of consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully conscious, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, with his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is in fact an intense form of means and interpretation, in a situation that is in itself intolerable, a capacity for organization that is given to us, men, so as not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Classen also describes his dreamlike experiences in his book "Change of heart" as an action to safeguard the soul.
He is 49 years old, when his conscious leaves for a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; Meanwhile, his body is condemned to remain motionless in intensive care.
Claussen plunges into a world he created from scratch, visits foreign places, travels back in time. He sees himself as an old man bedridden in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lived in the Middle Ages among nobles who made narcotics from blood.
He is kidnapped by a Greek on a motorcycle who takes him to his country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the névé of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He is completely absorbed in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is an entirely different state, he writes, describing what he experienced.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental journeys are extremely clear and highly detailed even years later.
We can even say that they are much more distinct and intensive than real experience.
The intensity of this experience shatters the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, dreamlike delusions, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even when awake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, psychologist Kasten summarizes, "can cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite rewarding.
The first snows can fall
Burda
At 27, the children will take over the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen as CEO of Burda Publishing House is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told the newspaper Spiegel.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at 27 and are determined to join society, Hubert Burda, 69, told Der Spiegel.
All details have been worked out in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise thereafter.
We will also have to see if they are able to do so.
You cannot impose your children on 7500 employees without knowing if they have the capacity to take care of them.
It would demolish the children as well as the company.
Burda said last Thursday that he was stepping down from the position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was first responsible for the technology sector.
Later he took care of the treasury sector, i.e. he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took over the head of marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
Thus for the first time it is not a member of the family who is at the head of Burda editions.
Burda's children are respectively 19 and 17 years old, her son Felix who would now be 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The Kallen nomination also serves to make the link of the next 10 or 15 years."
Burda says the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in families who have allowed themselves to be carried away by a bulimia of capital, who have made huge unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
That has never been my strategy.
I never had a dream of universal power," Burda said.
I absolutely do not see myself in the role of preceptor of the country as Springer could be and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have become far too important.
Integral beauty
Everything you could desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is the objective that El Corte Inglés seems to have set itself, which has just inaugurated in the shopping centre of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious brands such as Hedonai, specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation and beauty treatment rooms, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food department, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you among other things to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relaxation area to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax thanks to a jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, 250 m2 are divided into 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Such as, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide the steps of customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts with entering your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to properly perform our exercise program.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (warm-up and stretching included), are enough to work all the muscles of the body.
And, if after working our body, we want to go through the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi brand has a room where we offer hair repair, luminosity or nutrition rituals, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the watchwords of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Various necklines
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our festive wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, acquire the electric car
The electrical company Endesa, in collaboration with the Ayuntamiento of Barcelona, has created the "Oficina LIVE".
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "Oficina LIVE" (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and set up agreements concerning mobility, carrying out procedures, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the implementation of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
Its objective is to promote Research and Technological Development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa is involved in the promotion of electric cars.
The company participates in standardization groups on a European scale and has a set of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE in progress.
Zapatero sees "a future of tranquility" for the engine industry
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees "a future of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
During the presentation of the Prime Minister's Economic Report for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without a competitiveness plan for the automotive sector, we would now have a landscape of abandonment, closure of some of our main production sites," said the Prime Minister.
"Thanks to this plan and the decision of the brands to stay in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can envisage a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), has dedicated 800 million euros to the projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which have mobilized an investment of more than 3,000 million euros.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also highlighted government measures to support demand, referring to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with the autonomous communities and car companies.
According to the President, this plan has reduced by 6% the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market and has contributed to a "sharp increase" in registrations, which increased by "40%" in November.
20,000 m² of classic cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Classic Car Show, a meeting place for professionals and enthusiasts of the engine world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 m², where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can you find vintage motorcycles and cars, but ClassicAuto Madrid will also find items of all kinds related to the world of motoring.
Thus, at the exhibitors of the pavilion, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, complements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will delight collectors and the curious.
Among the participating companies we will find, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, specialists in car sales, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Francisco Pueche Cup, sale and restoration of automobiles, or Cochera Clásicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Outdoor aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this fair will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Proficiency tests with vintage cars and motorcycles will also take place on a circuit outside the fairgrounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Sustainable sportsmanship
Mazda wants to prove that sportsmanship is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated on the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for now, is only available on the 2.0 gasoline engine of 150 horsepower.
This second generation Mazda3 is illustrated by the good rating it obtained overall.
The details, the finish of the vehicle, the roominess, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the cockpit, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and attachment.
The feel of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the control panel and console, we see how Mazda has continued in the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
This is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more particularly with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough roominess to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Added to all this is a large chest with regular shapes.
The engine's automatic stop and start system, at least for now, is only available on the two-liter, 150-horsepower gasoline engine and with manual six-speed shifting.
This engine is a real pleasure. It is distinguished by its finesse, its low noise, its performance and the control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the Mazda3 most in demand are diesel models, those who do not drive a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its great speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sport, in other words the one with the largest number of standard elements.
Standard equipment includes lane change assistant (RVM) that eliminates blind spots, traction and stability controls, cruise control, photosensitive interior mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio,  as well as the 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly noteworthy.
In addition, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for 1,500 euros more, includes among other elements adaptable bi-xenon headlights and a BOSE audio system with disc charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is distinguished in particular by the quality of the materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not drive many kilometers per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the 2.0 gasoline engine of 150 horsepower.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this significant sum, the Mazda3 will offer us a large dose of satisfaction every day.
Luxury "Premiere"
L.A. covers the red carpet with sensuality embodied by Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled us more than ever, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as she was accustomed, had opted for a dark "lady".
The FonPeek Promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to look at your e-mail, without even offering the possibility of even seeing certain type of attachments or browsing the Internet.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, less than half of what the iPhone's data subscription costs, for example.
Given its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is just as limited as its American big brother, but comes with a surprise.
The price of his monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it's like to give up data when crossing a border or desperately looking for a cafeteria on Wi-Fi (or a Fon connection) to check your mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly appealing and it should have been working for a long time.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I'm concerned, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
The European Commission's repeated calls to order to propose affordable roaming tariffs across Europe have had a barely noticeable effect.
Outside your country of origin, you are reluctant to use the data, and you are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon when it does not have Wifi) offers this type of tariff, means that operators are starting to think differently and are studying different proposals to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other internet research.
Without subscription and without hassle.
It is a connected device and you pay when you buy it and not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: a purchase option with lifetime access like Peek already offers in the US.
Not that I want to buy it.
I check my mail on my phone, thank you.
I simply want it because I believe it is a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is, arguably, the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to Barack Obama's inauguration of the presidency of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, she has, in fact, chosen the same to accompany him in the second moment, without a doubt, the most important of his life: the presentation in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow pulling towards green with bright reflections, both times, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so that at first glance, it seems that the First Lady of the United States is following in the wake of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to put on the same outfits.
But the fabric from which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If for the taking office it was a thick lace, on the other hand, she wore in Oslo a printed velvet.
The accessories are also different: green shoes with medium heels for the first occasion, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now raised while she wore it loose the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had professional problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women from younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study "Fertility and professional career of women in Spain", carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers have had their professional careers limited because of motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life in a couple and the number of children, whether the woman works or not and the type of job held.
Those who do not work outside the home, work part-time or have an unstable job, start a relationship earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, postpone entry into life as a couple and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women aged 35 to 49 with a permanent job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after moving into a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "These data show that women with stable employment have needed more time in their lives to get it, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment held largely influences motherhood, but less so the date of the start of cohabitation," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
Educational attainment is another factor widening the gap in the age of marriage between women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the later they marry and have their first child.
The difference also persists among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35- to 49-year-old group, those with elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at an average age of 25.1 and 32.1, respectively.
"Another distinction also appears between women, depending on their level of education.
While those with elementary education marry and have their first child before finding stable employment, those with middle or higher education reverse this program and prioritize getting stable work as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also well worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will embody the image of several of the brand's products, singing the universal motto "Because I'm worth it".
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other celebrities registered with L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
On the men's side, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
British fashion prices
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its greatest representatives, designers and models, past and present, gathered for their annual award ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vincent's Ace Poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "X-rays" of writers who have crossed his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
He does not do this according to predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent spares neither fears nor enlightenment.
A delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to read and re-read.
I leave you here some snapshots.
On Albert Camus: "In its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the very one I felt without naming it: pleasure against fatal fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that almost killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in the flesh of which he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven by the path of perdition."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight-thousand-meter peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed by the north face, on which the best mountaineers let go again and again. »
On William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
Of himself he sometimes said that he was the heir of a landowner in the county and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were great. »
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the insane cry pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century, in his literary form, and he did it in the flight of himself and invoking posteriority with a violent speech to maggots. "
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she got down on her knees and prayed, 'Beloved God, I beg you to stop writing like a woman.'
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved the verses of Spenser: "Sleep after effort, / after the storm the port, / rest after the war, / after life, tired death delights. "
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband would normally accept that she told him that Edward VII was spying on her between azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent exceeded madness. »
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if not try to hide Joyce at Baroja's house?
What did Benet try if not to have Baroja shot by Faulkner?
What did this do but suck up the glory of this man to serve as his pedestal? »
A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood in the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a blood-sucker, rescued from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they kicked her twice that left the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what is fun to gratuitously attack a small helpless animal which, moreover, was on a leash.
To this must be added the indignation of a lady who was walking quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energizer who attacks an animal is able to do the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., a Tuesday like any other, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog whined all day.
We have of course filed a complaint with the local police station even if we doubt that it will serve much purpose and not to touch the sensibilities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
The indignation led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what happens to young people so that they find it fun to gratuitously abuse a helpless animal that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where the proper education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, helmet kits
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage helmet use, mainly among the youngest motorcyclists, as indicated today by the two structures.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, since it is the only protective element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeled accident.
Michelin said the campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing ever safer products" and said it contributed to this objective through other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to encourage the use of helmets on two wheels, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, to ensure their widest distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles grow
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market is starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the employers' union of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, the dealers' union.
However, the good news needs to be qualified, since the benchmark used for the comparison in November 2008 was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite last month's rebound, registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, when all vehicles in the light commercial vehicle category (derived from passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, light vans and light-frame trucks) are added together, 95,853 vehicles have been sold.
The big clouds that affect their demand the most have not dissipated. Indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay almost 100% of the time with external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions implied by the limitation of bank credit, we must add other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
Faced with this situation and unlike passenger vehicles, the aid for the purchase of the 2000E has been of little use.
In addition to individuals, self-employed persons and SMEs who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle weighing less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, it was again recalled the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers' association forecasts a year 2010 similar to the one that is coming to an end, for which it calculates a 19% drop in sales (passenger vehicles and 4x4s).
Emergency brake assist is now mandatory
As happened with ABS anti-lock braking system and as will happen with ESP stability control, emergency brake assist systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory for newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a waiting period has been set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen pedestrian protection, even if, by its mode of action, it can also help avoid many rear impacts.
Emergency Brake Assist works by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system through the driver's kick.
But the latter does not always keep up the pressure until the end.
According to a study by car component manufacturer Bosch, a third of drivers involved in an accident were unable to press the brake before the collision, and half of them did not take advantage of its full strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in revancha, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is calculated that one in four accidents with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to radar or camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps him by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts the maximum force on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva would be launched in the first week of April – probably on the 8th – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it will need more time to conclude Opel's contingency plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants every point in the plan to have been approved in advance by the affected party.
And this may mean that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, is postponed until early 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, it is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with possible new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, backed by Russia's Converg Group, is gaining prominence.
In the event that there is no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their latest and precious jewel, Porsche engineers started from the Boxster S and managed to slim it down by nothing less than 80 kilos, which leaves the balance at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to do without, in the first place, the automatic roof which was replaced by a manual tarpaulin roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors like those of the GT3, another 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the gas tank from 64 to 54 liters,  7 kilos gained, to mount sports bacquets, another 12 kilos, and with light tires of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, gaining another six kilograms and replacing door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual-clutch PDK transmission, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual transmission model, mainly on secondary network roads in California, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous bends.
His behaviour can only be described as irreproachable.
The decrease in weight does not prevent the car from driving on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it has been a long time since we tested such a small and light model that, at the same time, guarantees so much safety in corners, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles at low speed for the necessary time, until we ask him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again...
That's what we wanted. Thanks to its steering, as communicative as it is precise, the car will do what our hands indicate on the steering wheel.
And she will do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be reinforced with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether stationary or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The road surface we drove with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car handled potholes well.
The electronic assistants barely showed up all the way, while on some corners we found ice in the early morning and gravel later in the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, one of the most entertaining to drive and which is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
"Bag Girl"
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the fashion shows of the house, the singer displays her face of bad girl with as much capacity as her Chanel bags.
More than a "Bad Girl" or an "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia wins Israel
Caja Laboral scored a resounding 91-82 triumph on their visit to Maccabi Electra's tough pitch, despite the many absences suffered by Dusko Ivanovic's team. It is thus at the top of its group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight three-point baskets was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
The Vitoria team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great deal of commitment and collective work, even if they had to wait until the end to take the victory.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 three-point baskets scored, largely determined the final victory.
The match started quickly for the blue and red, who took the lead from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were scored from the perimeter, suggested that they had jumped on the Israeli court with hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the final 18-20 of the first quarter.
The second quarter was in the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barac's inside play and the work of Eliyahu, who was greeted with cheers and applause back at his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best player on his team, scoring 13 points, although Splitter's "minus six" rating already hinted that this night wasn't going to be the Brazilian's best.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from it, and the Avala team wanted to remind the Vitoria team that you do not win so easily on their pitch, and thanks to "Elias' hand", they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini were instrumental in helping the yellows take the lead over the bright 50-49.
Other challenges
Ivanovic's players, injured but far from dead, needed to string together some skillful actions to get some fresh air, and that's when Mirza Teletovic's machine gun emerged, which, with three consecutive three-point baskets and the help of English and Ribas, put the clock back to a reassuring score (54-67), and that the locals managed to accentuate at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Avala team came out to play everything for everything in the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) advised that they were not going to tire anyone to take what they had deserved during the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign themselves and tried to support it from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for fouls, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis came close in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory eluded Tel Aviv for the first time this season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to Olympiacos and ceded the lead in Group B of the Euroleague, in a match marked by the absences of Unicaja players, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or by the size of the rival, undoubtedly one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter, allowed to dream the Andalusians. An aggressive defense and three consecutive three-point baskets, two from point guard Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio who dazzled the home team 12-18 in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the home team's arsenal with the inside play of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, made it possible to turn the score 22-20, in the thirteenth minute, when an action, an early fight, between North American leaders Beverley and Williams resulted in the disqualification of both players.
The Greek team began to function by showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit due to injury of English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal fouls of Carlos Jiménez weighed on Unicaja.
The interior players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, extended the lead 44-32 in the nineteenth minute.
An impossible ascent
The third period was particularly offensive for Olympiacos who, despite the 19 losses, were superior and even managed to equal the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, in the twenty-seventh minute, shaking the lead of the group.
Unicaja were trying to overcome the absences and the last outing of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the game.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis' support, left some hope with 66-57, in the thirty-first minute.
But victory was virtually impossible as Olympiacos were relentless when the players pressured and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the score to 81-62, in the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can find out how much they deserve based on their profile, thanks to a new app from Trovit, the search engine with the highest number of real estate, job and vehicle classifieds in Spain.
The tool "How much should you be paid?" calculates users' salaries from more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, years of experience, age and the city where you want to work.
In the week that the application has been running, the search engine has detected that, as a rule, the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid," Trovit's product manager, Albert Ribera, said in a statement.
According to data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the lowest paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 euros gross annually and a Frenchman, 31,059, while a Spaniard receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives €34,247 gross annually in England, €25,751 in France and €16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 euros net annually, followed by that of salesman, with 14,725 euros, and that of worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are driver, part-time and social worker.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The ousted president will have to give up the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of his mandate.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27, at the end of his mandate, he must look for another destination."
The channel also quoted the former proxy, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the established deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, since Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that the de facto government presided over by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much
After rosy days since last spring, when asset inflation was the dominant note in the markets, uncertainty is once again arising, which is not surprising given their natural state, in an environment where agents are making decisions about an inherently uncertain future.
The remedy employed by central banks to stabilize markets has been to monetize debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving abundant liquidity at near-zero rates, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been virtually finalized and, without questioning their maverick liquidity policy, are starting to put some sand in the wheels, as the ECB did, with their one-year auction next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain an economic recovery without heterodox measures, and we are seeing a reversal of the reduction in risk premia.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads are rising again, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
There is again a flight towards quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the safe havens chosen by investors, causing a widening of the differences between the countries of the euro area and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor'sa threatened with a further downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad for silencing moral hazard advocates, who were again trying to provoke a case of conscience among world economic policymakers who had curbed the destructive effects of credit limitation on job destruction, when what should be done was to declare a new Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the emirs to restore its place in power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot of roses.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be completely irrational for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a eurozone Member State to fail to meet its commitments.
What is logical, however, is that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens jointly responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we find ourselves faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in high positions, this would be to be expected.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt spreads grow in line with European corporate bonds, we need not worry.
If European gaps were to narrow and ours continued to grow, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecasting indicators force most research departments to anticipate their recovery models and revise upwards their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission coming back with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not bode well for their warning.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the moment "prudence is the mother of safety".
Connected sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades is being discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán sketched for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommittee, behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros until 2020 and 60,000 million more between that date and 2030, in the event that the nuclear plants currently in operation remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60 000 million but to 95 000 million.
On the other hand, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the question changes, and it will be necessary to increase the power.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal power plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this area, he considers that an additional 18,000 MW are needed, with other "supporting energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft law on sustainable economy that the government has just approved is in line with what his company is demanding, did not want to attack the royal decree aimed at encouraging the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this direction, despite the "punctual" measures, as the president of Iberdrola described them.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must begin to be made, as they take some time to reach maturity and a stable remunerative framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus material handling contract at ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, Ferrovial's subsidiary for airport services on land, will play the role of privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been disclosed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a collaboration protocol to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Center.
The alliance foresees an investment of 20 million until 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the centre's tasks will be to carry out research on energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes in its first motorway in Australia at Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession highway in Australia, a market it is already working on as an energy company and water manager.
The construction site at stake is a tunnel estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5-kilometre-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and motorway concessionaire.
The town hall of the city wants to be able to dispose of it by the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the presentation of their offers next May, the planned investment amounts to 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros) and in the last phase three consortia are competing with each other, with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the lisse, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium is fighting, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French manufacturer group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major construction sites and privatizations, but entering it represents a great difficulty, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which still remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS has just gained a foothold in this market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Acciona is focusing on a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, in which it already has a large presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the consortium of companies responsible for building and managing the Adelaide watermaker, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The underground toll lane, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Bureau and the so-called Northern Link, is set to connect the Toowong Western Highway to the Kelvin Grove Ring Road (see map) through 4 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule set by the administration indicates that the auction will take place during the summer of 2010 and that work will begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that this toll lane will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the work will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will consist of two lanes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to grow Hochtief, which yesterday mentioned winning a contract with the government valued at $154 million.
The ACS-owned company will equip the national broadband network infrastructure with fibre optics through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This intervention will provide 400,000 people with fast access to the Internet and will provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company sold the project to build the 27-storey King George Tower in the city of Brisbane. Work has not yet begun and Hochtief has completed the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, more precisely in Manchester, she shared with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be €75 million.
FCC awarded tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the contract for the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for €64.5 million.
The company was awarded the contract a few days after being awarded the 130 million extension of the Bosruck tunnel in Austria.
Alpine is thus consolidating its experience in tunnel construction.
Construction is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Sra. Rushmore awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe has entrusted advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the Sra agency. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, said the rail operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was chosen from 16 agencies that submitted to Renfe's tender, four of which were finalists, including TBWA, which has been responsible for creativity for the past three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Telecom to curb competition
The French competition regulator has fined France Telecom €63 million for its anti-competitive conduct in the country's Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programs outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still a state company, accumulates more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it puts on its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has also been increased because the competition authority considers that France Telecom has committed similar infringements in the past and that it is therefore a repeat offender.
An app store
On the other hand, the mobile phone subsidiary of the French company followed in the wake of other operators and opened an Internet application store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
Initially, Orange's app store will be active in France and the UK.
It was not until 2010 that it arrived in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has brought in 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its inception.
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs, since its birth in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona earned 467.4 million, which places them in third and fifth position of the clubs that have pocketed the most money in this competition.
Manchester United are at the top of the list.
Manchester United are at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League doesn't just bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
Indeed, the competition distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to information from UEFA.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served in this distribution.
The white club was the third on the continent to receive the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, current defending champions and last winners of the old European Cup in 1992, are fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And this, despite losing to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, in terms of money brought in by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox can be explained by UEFA's complex procedure for distributing money.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to earn 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will spend €413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification matches (including Atlético de Madrid) received €2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to 550,000 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and tie (400,000 for each team). Those who reach the knockout stages receive three million each, the eight teams that reach the quarter-finals receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will earn 9 million, against the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, under fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four designated places.
The previous year's champion pockets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday listed the details of the share purchase offer by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not oblige it to launch a takeover bid for all the securities.
Concretely, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share, which will be disbursed in 10 years and will be remunerated at a rate of 1% per year for this deferral.
Yesterday, Sos shares ended at 1.85 euros; Nueva Rumassa's offer therefore values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerez group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to indicate their interest in selling the shares.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company said it had contacted the regulator.
If it were to take place, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay out of possible takeover bids and the legal backings of its former directors, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, it announced the election of María Luis Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a management position in the food company.
This is a newly created position that will report directly to the chairman of the group.
And it is not free of controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal new embezzlement cannot be ruled out.
Regarding the Salazar credit, former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Court that they had been informed of the embezzlement of 212 million without knowing its destination.
CNMV authorises Paternina's takeover bid submitted by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusionary takeover bid presented by Inversora Mer for Federico Paternina on October 9.
The monitoring body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were adjusted to the standards in force and that it considered "sufficient" the content of the explanatory leaflet presented, following the amendments applied on December 2.
The CNMV specified that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of €7.65 per share, which represents 8.95% of the share capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares were immobilized, and that they could not in any way be transferred before the completion of the offer, the price of which he indicated had been set by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the regulations in force.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a loss are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage and the cost of repair.
Every claim is different, and calculating parts costs and labor time can be a long and complex job.
Calculating by hand the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
For this reason, almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Providers of claims assessment and maintenance services and solutions are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers as a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of assessment tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that in the last five years, more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car hits the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very difficult job, because you have to catalog each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and enter its price.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image of each model is created that can be clicked on the different parts of a passenger car.
If it is a massively sold model, the work can be ready in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If it is a low-selling automobile, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have, for example, information on Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghini.
For vehicles on the road, the figure is over 99%.
To carry out the documentation and database development work, Audatex has eight centers around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than one hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million annually to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million pieces of data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer different products.
The most common application concerns repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing breakage parts or to calculate the market or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that provides information on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
Looking at the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
The company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard claims assessment solution for adjusters.
It includes cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it takes into account repair times estimated by the manufacturer or paint schedules.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expertises, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it has rolled off the assembly line, only by its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glasses, and AudaSubastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows bidding on vehicles declared wrecked.
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geo-demographic analyses or knowing common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a given brand have gone to the garage for a breakdown or how many have suffered serious losses for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the manufacturer's official parts, prices and times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of claims, breakdowns or car maintenance.
The GT Evaluation Guide is a historical reference product in the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has grown at a rate of 20% per year over the past three years, and it made a turnover of 10.8 million euros in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, it began its internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established itself in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, 3,000 of which are located in Spain.
Solera Group's worldwide revenue (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, 3.3% higher than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed on the stock exchange for $1,000 million, today its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the benchmark Standard & Poor's index.
Internet auctions of damaged cars
Last October, the Solera Group bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of damaged cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company's capital, which could expand next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This appraisal and sales service is aimed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, junkyards and professional sellers who must be registered before starting operations.
This platform was founded in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 sellers and 4000 registered experts on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and in the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer be driven, but on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Classic cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex procedures.
Four-step garage quote
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
