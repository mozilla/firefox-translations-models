Inflation in Europe has slipped on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, the price increase in the 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, after an inflation rate of 2.6% in October, annual inflation of 3.1% was recorded, said the European Community Bureau of Statistics located in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 per cent, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the interest rate by saying that declining interest rates, with growth in commodity prices and falling unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two per cent.
According to an analyst, Catch 22 for the ECB is "we must deterre" inflation so that we no longer have to intervene on this subject at a later stage.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent is a record in the last 12 years and in Spain it rose from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area took off as a result of the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
The market term of the cereal ratings have increased by 88 per cent and the price of soya has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of edible oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world price of oil rose by 52 per cent, and last month a barrel of black gold was worth almost 100 dollars.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3%, however, the average annual rate will be 2.1% over the next 3 to 4 months.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to lower the policy rate twice in 2008.
Gallup reports government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of the Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) increased significantly in early December. Thus, since 2002, it currently has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Proflation Institute) has never seen such a low socialist support before, according to 13 per cent.
For the faithful voters, the difference would represent, because of the greater determination of opposition voters, support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of a five-month (20 per cent) for the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSP).
According to the poll, the MDF (Hungarian Democratic Forum) and the Alliance of Free Democrats are below the parliamentary threshold: their support is two percent across the population.
Of the loyal voters, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 per cent.
The economic climate continued to deteriorate from the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who considered the country's economic situation to be particularly serious has never been more severe, it stands at 41 per cent and the situation is quite serious, and the situation is quite serious according to 46 per cent.
With the more optimistic prospects of spring and last summer, families are once again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population expects to increase and only one tenth predicts an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71% of respondents, a majority never seen in Gallup’s previous polls, said that the prime minister was doing his job rather poorly than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcs-ny, while 38 percent support Viktor Orban.
54% do not trust the Prime Minister at all and 27 per cent in the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of change in the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that the prime minister's discontent vis-à-vis the Prime Minister can be dealt with without change of government.
While the riots of last October, 35 per cent of respondents wanted the government and the prime minister to remain in office, currently only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believes that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
To the question concerning the intention of voting, 60 per cent of respondents say that they would certainly vote and the additional 20 per cent say they would probably go to vote.
To make the comparison, for a "organization election next Sunday", only 55% of respondents would certainly participate and 15 percent would probably participate. According to the current intentions, the outcome of the referendum would be of no doubt.
74% of people would say no to higher education fees, 79 per cent would say no at the consultation fee and 84 per cent would say no to hospital subsistence.
When we look only at the same proportion among the persons who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the voters, respectively, would reject the introduction of tuition fees, consultation fees and hospital subsistence expenses.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets in the commercial triangle in Budaers maintained the average price increase of 16 per cent last year, the difference that this year's VAT rate did not go up.
Article by Napi Gazdasag (daily economy)
This year, in the Budaers trading triangle, the usual daily Christmas basket also increased by an average of 16 percent, a much higher value increase to a thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
Prices, which had already soared in the department stores last December, did not rise sharply compared to the previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that the items purchased well below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand Hints.
The daily basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded the psychological threshold of a total of 10 thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
And the highest value in the basket was 10,273 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at the level of last year, however, turkey, nut and poppy prices rose sharply.
In shops, the price of flour and bread followed data from the KSH (Central Statistics Institute), but at Auchan's only bread was found from 1 kg to 139 heints.
Competition did not lower the product price below 200 forints.
It was astonishing to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the two-litre Coca-Cola bottle was below 200 forints, so it only cost 257 Vints the recorded bottle included.
It only preempts this year, in terms of daily basket, Auchan was the most expensive and cheapest Cora.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its daily basket by 15 per cent, while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 and 18 per cent respectively.
Comparing the most expensive basket of last year and the cheapest basket of this year, we see a gap of 12 percent while the difference between last year's cheapest and most expensive this year is 21 percent.
Prices increased by HUF 1,480 on average.
Last year, prices rose by HUF 1 206 on average, while knowing that the impact of the increase in the VAT rate was already noticed in last year's Christmas prices.
This process has perplexed trade, hypermarkets could not visibly determine which margin to apply to products as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he risks losing a large profit on the margin adjusted to the intensity of trade.)
As a result of the change in the VAT rate, the increase in daily basket prices has changed in such an assume so excessive that the most expensive basket was 1 720 forints higher than the value of 2006 whereas the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive since the value of the most expensive basket was 1,630 forints higher than last year's, and the cheapest prices also increased by 1,284 forints.
By bringing the two seasons closer to Christmas, we have seen a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of everyday consumer goods have risen by more than 30 per cent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH data: for some foods of primary necessity, the Institute of Statistics has found a price increase of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and egg.)
According to the daily basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has risen by just more than 10% from the base.
According to the evidence, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have succeeded in getting the huge price increase also accepted by multinationals.
In the commercial golden triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experience, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take the long-life foods in pallets.
On Wednesday morning, large tails formed at the checkouts of the three hypermarkets because the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, turnover is lower in the provinces, and many multinationals are complaining to the fact that they are not even up to the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overwork of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the chief doctor of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also save on disinfectants
Not long ago, an MRSA infection was diagnosed at the trauma department of the Junos Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was detected in a man hospitalized as a result of a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured person in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital but not until recently had returned due to an MRSA infection and since then the doctors have not been able to do a major operation because of the bacterium in his body.
As of December 10 this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multidrug-resistant pathogen were reported to the National System of Civil Surveillance, said Karolina Bocz, chief physician of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
Namely, it's the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. by staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
One third of people carry the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium in their noses without developing a disease.
Infections caused by AS (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, and are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used in excessive or inappropriate ways, the bacterium, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a well-resistant bacterium that will proliferate rapidly in poor hospital conditions.
In the event of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or sepsis, on elderly patients, low weight or with a weakened organism.
According to the doctor head of the Jonos Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily life of hospitals.
Above all, infection should not be confused with the epidemic, there is no MRSA just it or we are not looking for it, said Tibor Nyulasi.
ASs are resistant to antibiotics.
'These patients are isolated, the caregiver puts rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics adapted to treat them,' said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, inpatient patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, however infection cannot always be avoided.
The sample elevation is not in the fashion
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multidrug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Borcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and residences for the elderly, hospitals should monitor in-patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these examinations.
Most cases are only found if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief physician of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has rigorous recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are Hungarian directives also for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out in order to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take it into account.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient care and basic care, said Karolina Boercz.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that the MRSA proliferate of one patient has another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, to put on gloves and protective masks. However, there are significant shortcomings in hospitals also in this area.
MRSA proliferate by infection transmitted by droplets and contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
Moreover, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other, while in terms of the epidemic, the sick should be kept apart by a minimum of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also see that hospitals, which are in a difficult financial situation, are saving on disinfectants, they lack nurses, the patients are numerous, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Boruzcz.
According to Karolina Borzcz, in hospitals where preventive measures are followed, the number of infections is lower in demonstrable manner or the proliferation of the pathogenic agent may be blocked.
Government project against the MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenses for social security funds, which is why this infection is being combated everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a programme to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSAs.
According to published data, this programme is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) identifies among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-drug resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The commissioner, who had a fatal accident, was not drunk
The official statement relating to the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement has been drawn up.
It may be excluded that the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who has since resigned from his post, who crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, reportedly led in drunkenness or dizzy, said Attila Morvai, spokesman for the Ministere's public in the capital after the relative finding had been made.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation which already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before driving
Last Tuesday, the former head of the police station in the 22nd arrondissement crushed a 55-year-old man who found himself facing him when he shot, with his private car, in Kossuth Lajos Street in the 22nd arrondissement. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing through the pedestrian crossing.
(Besides, the fact that it crossed the road outside the pedestrian crossing is not a mitigating circumstance, according to the Highway Code, a car that is entering a bend must allow pedestrians to pass.)
The pedestrian died after being taken to the hospital.
As a result of the accident, the Commissioner resigned from his post and asked for his retirement because, according to the police communication, this accident shocked him a great deal.
The investigation into this case is led by the Bucharest Department of Public Prosecutions.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner cooperated with the magistrates conducting the investigation.
Additional EUR 400 million for infrastructure
The Hungarian Minister of Finance, J. Veres, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements on a total value of EUR 400 million on a credit line on Budapest to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy efficiency.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for Hungarian budget financing of transport and environment projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, of which a credit agreement worth EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties. This time, the contract signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement also concerns the budgetary financing of projects linked to education.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, with the remaining EUR 150 million available for later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a EUR 50 million contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope primarily as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the metro line 4 project was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would discuss the possible amendment of the original contract once Hungary has finalised the details of the metro financing with the EU.
According to Jonos Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has provided a total of EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB provides its loans at the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without a commitment fee.
Bulgaria, an EU Real Estate Market
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, with the attention of the whole of Europe being focused on this Balkan country little mentioned in the past.
What, or who buys in this EU market which is still the cheapest but will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and cheap seaside houses.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albéna, the "Golden Sands", the "Sun Coast", the former Sozopol and Nessebar but more and more are looking for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik region as well.
According to analysts at Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also arouse investors' interest, and there are also more and more of them to buy in the cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, offers attractive opportunities as well, the areas of shops and offices promise the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best route to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus to be a priority destination, after the summer season and the winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are still looking for a change in their lives, their way of life.
Most buyers are English but others are from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who intend to move to settle buy renovated buildings, have a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old dilapidated houses, has a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, proximity to a large city, shops and, in general, the local doctor.
The second group includes second-hand home buyers (since last December, Bulgaria is one of the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving medium or long-term capital gains.
The price of buildings in the capital is constantly increasing as a result of growing demand.
In the European Union, house prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, over the past 5 years, they have increased by 21 per cent each year.
The increase in house prices mainly exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Hungarian six per cent
According to the communication by the Minister for the Environment and Waters, the Minister for the Environment and Waters, meetings of professionals are being completed on Tuesday, however, on Wednesday, after the official opening, the ministers' negotiations on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Road Map that is expected to define efforts to achieve the Kyoto Protocol emission reduction period until 2012.
At the moment, there is a great deal of discussion between developing and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, it did not wish to discuss exact figures, while it was ready to sign an agreement on the reduction, until 2020, of greenhouse gas emissions from 25 to 40 per cent from the 1990 level.
Another important topic of the conference was whether developed countries were committing themselves, excluding emission reductions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement has also been signed on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member Governing Council probably under the United Nations Global Environment Facility (GEF), said Piac és Profit (Market and Profit).
The six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for the Environment and Waters, Gobor Fodor, confirms the EU's ambition to retain its role as flagship in overall efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 20% compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the successful signing of the "Agreements 2012", and it was expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 30 per cent if the other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also responsible for making commitments to their responsibility and capabilities.
Mr Fodor recalled that in 1997 the Kyoto Protocol countries had a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members of that time committed an additional 8 per cent.
Hungary is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent from the level of the period between 1985 and 1987, and our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the press release of the Minister for the Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed until 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the need for which was stressed in the new report of IPCC, the international scientific body, which won the Nobel Peace Prize for Climate Change.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2 degrees Celcius could no longer be avoided which, according to the scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army Recruits on YouTube
British Army units communicate on the video-sharing site recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to make themselves popular.
First, it is the British Air Force (BYR) that has been passionate about YouTube: special units in Afghanistan are charging video footage on operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken with the help of miniature cameras mounted on the helmets, are checked at the Kandahar Air Force Operations headquarters and are then transferred to London where the compatriots charge them over the Internet.
The political message is inescapable
Air force soldiers have already passed 139 footage through this route and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75,000 people.
The British Defence Department registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and reports videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan as the Commonwealth Minister (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the original purpose of the air force, the videos were made on the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they also served to make the general public aware of the real objectives of the presence of the army abroad.
Propaganda published by this route bears virtually nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements that have been made on television, the BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant, told the BBC. On the other hand, it also inevitably carries a political message, since it justifies in a special form the validity of the military operations decided by the Government.
Americans have made a game
The army is empathised because, apart from the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos are sent to the sharing site that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the “official” propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
Indeed, many videos were already posted on the net showing the areas of operation in Iraq and Afghanistan that were being carried out on a real mission, but the British army is only rushing to load these videos for a recent time.
Americans do the recruitment a little bit differently using the American's Army shooting game that can be downloaded free of charge. In this game, the player can put himself directly in the place of soldiers in a more or less real simulation.
Christmas raffle and doughnuts in the ministries
Labour Minister Munika Lamperth does not seem to be sentimental: instead of Feter Christmas, she will hold a year-end meeting with her colleagues who will be able to bid farewell to 2007 by taking doughnuts and coffee.
Another minister will organize a party with live music, another will delight officials with a raffle and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Fete, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so entertained power.
The public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas party will be organised by the Ministry of Defence, but it is not the employees of the Ministry who will be invited to do so.
At Christmas, Orphans, the children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts for missionary Christmas, with family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited to attend and a press reception will also take place.
The Ministry provides for a budget of 25 million HUF to create the end-of-year atmosphere.
In comparison with the other ministries, the National Development Agency (NF-plus) and the Minister of Economy and Transport (GKM) will fester.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of HUF 4,320,000 and, of the six hundred employees in bulk, three hundred and fifty are expected.
During this feast, the Christmas atmosphere will be the order of the day, there will be actors and also a raffle.
The NF-Nun Christmas cost HUF 4,700,000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the National Council of Justice (ILO) building with concerts and a dinner.
The rental of the room cost a million Hints, the rest was spent on the more than 400 guests.
According to our information, a service of the NF- is invited to another Christmas party which is organised with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, a company managing the invitation to tender.
The building of the Théâtre de la Gaîté has been rented for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG 'rt' because we have not been able to reach the person responsible.
Suit is not mandatory
The ILO building was not only home to the NF-, but also the Minister of Justice and the Police, who, instead of a Christmas party, organized a ball on the occasion of Saint Luca on 7 December.
The ILO did not charge them for the use of its rooms.
There were five hundred people in the ball.
The party began with the Minister's words of welcome and the dinner was followed by a dance party on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo): the evening dress was not at all obligatory at this ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour and Local Government are preparing a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a fete to its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 HUF.
On the other hand, the Minister of Labour, M. Lamperth, does not officially invite his collaborators to a Christmas party but has a working meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to have a coffee and eating doughnuts, the press service said, the fete will only cost 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Government, will simply invite his collaborators to have a drink in the aula du Ministère des collectivités locals and land-use planning.
The Finance Minister (PM) will organize a Christmas party in its large hall, which is expected of 436 employees.
He plans to spend 2,500 Hand-want Hands per Guest, including a buffet and a glass.
Since the arrival of Jonos Veres, PM employees have been making Christmas every year.
No atmosphere of purpose, the official character is reinforced not only by the Minister's presentation but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will hold a reception on 20 January to mark the new year, the Christmas party will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the town wood, and according to the Ministry's communication, 1,000 Hands per person are calculated for the 100 guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started with a few words of welcome from the Minister followed by a modest meal.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Education and Culture do not make a party at all for Christmas, the respective press services have been provided.
The press service of the Environment Minister did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than 400 people were invited to the organized festival at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega-strand gather
The League's trade unions and the National Association of Workers' Councils will, on Friday, constitute their strike commission, which will be responsible for coordinating the strike indefinitely on Monday.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protest will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the law on health coffers, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause major traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic, as rail traffic will be almost completely stopped and the employees of BKV (public transport company) will also increase until 1 p.m.
The League's Trade Unions will public, on Friday afternoon, the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The LIGA's strike committee will also be set up, it will serve as the coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protest will be held and, starting on Monday, the organisations joining the strike will stop the work for an indefinite period if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in Parliament on the law on health coffers, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Coffers Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call to the strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the follow-up.
According to Monday's agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the Health Coffers Act will take place only late in the evening, or even the night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, large traffic jams are planned: the railways will stop working for an indefinite period and during the morning part of the public transport in Budapest and more than half of the Volon companies are in danger of being stopped.
At the same time, at different points of the country, half of the way will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call, and the list is being updated on the League's website on a permanent basis.
Some organizations report that the strike is being carried out for an indeterminate period of time, others have declared a temporary stoppage of work.
Until Thursday afternoon the Hungarian Railways and the Free Smokeway Trade Union (VDS-S) have failed to reach an agreement on minimum services, but the approaching of Christmas festivals, more and more people are taking the train.
According to current communications, the public transport in Budapest will increase from the start of service until 1 p.m., Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the League's Electricity and Thermal Energy Industrial Unions will make a four-hour strike, the Teachers' Union and the Teachers' Democratic Union have called for a craft for 2 hours and 2 hours to 8 hours, respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will be recruited throughout the country on an alternating basis, the Union of Health and Social Sector Employees (EDDS) attached to the S-EF will make a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands, made by the League, required the government to withdraw its proposal for health reform and subject a new approach to social debate.
The second demand requires that the new method of calculating retirement to be introduced from next year to be introduced in several stages.
The third demand is to provide a guarantee, in the case of retirement before the statutory age, which would make it possible to move the functions that deserve it before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDS-S), attached to the League Unions, of the proposal of the Minister of Economy and Transport concerning secondary rail lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased risk country
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital (Risk Analysing Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August, with the support of Jobbik Magyarorsz-gerity Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary) is increasing in several respects the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its “risk warning”, the company states that, in connection with the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that “a short-term aggressive ethnic clashes can occur as a result of the worsening of the already existing ethnic tension between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population of Hungary”.
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy likely to provoke this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is due to one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have gone through the public debate on the matter of the Roma to representatives of the radical and extreme political groupings that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Gypsies and the Hungarians".
The problem is compounded, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are being strengthened and aggressive conflicts are more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, as a result of the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard “significantly damaged Hungary's image abroad, in particular with regard to the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country”.
They recall that, as a result of the reorganisation of radical and extreme Hungarian straight groups since the autumn of 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 as the name of "national self-defence association".
“The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civilian organization when they publicly declare the preparation of their members to defence missions (disasters, national defence, defence of the order), armed if necessary, moreover, by referring to the unfitness of the police, the army, in other words, of the state,” they added.
They pointed out that everything was happening according to the method which, on the basis of the resentment of the political society and the parties, sought to disguise different political ambitions in a civil aspect.
The emphasis on civil character and the status of association is therefore only only to avoid legal traps from registering such associations in court, but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk compared to neighbourly relations.
“In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a source of potential risk, and the ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries wish to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influences the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the work of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The many Roma unrest that broke out in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) is the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian Guard.
Taking advantage of these events, BNU decided to establish a guard by saying that the objective of the organization is “national self-defence”.
According to them, over the past 17 years, the Gypsies “terrorized” Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and neutral, says Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had given rise to lively debate in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the declaration of some Bulgarian Roma organisations concerning the establishment of their own guard as a resistance signals the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard, which showed similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, does not exclude that the Hungarian Roma are reacting to the threat of the same way by organising their own self-defence, the risk warning of Political Capital reads.
At the telegraphic agency's request for information, Attila Juh's research director, Political Capital, said: risk analysis is one of the research institute's activities.
As he said, their risk analysis is published annually and if events occur that could have an impact on the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The fete is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the days of celebration and, around the leaves, it has become common practice to reorganise the working days, the number of which will decrease next year.
The leaves are not uniform in the EU and the US either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes between national and state days and rest days.
Rest days are often linked to religious fetes or to important historical events.
In Hungary, we are counting the new year, the last day of the year, which is coming to an end and the first day of the new year, the new day, especially so that the New Year's E-mailers can rest quietly.
Moreover, in a year's time, we have a total of eleven marked red fetes.
March 15 is a national party, in commemoration of the revolution of 1848, as well as 23 October, which is the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, we make the constitution of our state, on 1 May is the party of work and on 1 and 2 November we remember the members of our family and our deceased friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, at Pentecost and at Christmas.
On the days of our state, national or religious fetes rarely falling on a weekend, depending on the calendar, it has become common to reorganize working days in cases where there is only one working day left before or after the marked party in red.
It is true that we pay the price for extended weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has been acting in a particular regulation on the replacement days of the days preceding or after the days before the days before the parties.
The law covers all employers and all their employees, civil servants and persons working in the public service.
However, it does not apply to service companies, institutions that rotate without interruption and in service, because of their vocation, and also for rest days.
This year, working days will be changed only around the end-of-year festivals: from 24 December, life is stopped almost throughout the country because, depending on the experience, the majority of people are rather working overtime or take holidays that they have saved for these purposes so that they can spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many of the leaves fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganised the first time around the work party to allow employees to stay at home for four days in a row.
Saturday, 25 April will be a working day for a rest day on Friday, 2 May.
Another change is planned for 23 October: Saturday 18 October will be a working day replacing Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is coming under the banished because from 24 December, everyone will take a non-stop break even if New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six trivial things that can boggle the collegues terribly
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that almost annoy us more: these are things that “beautify” the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether one gets used to these troubles or one recovers the challenge and we consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called from the marketing department," a colleague told you.
That you missed a date?
At best he is sorry and tries to arrange things by calling the marketing department to tell them that he has forgotten to pass on the message (this is the least common solution).
In the majority of cases, the thing is arranged with an apology.
Before having painful explanations, it is useful to reflect on how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a folder, an office tool or the phone and you can't find them anywhere.
Remember the day before you put the stapmaker on the desk but she disappeared the next morning?
Do you accidentally find your pen that you thought was lost on your collegue's desk?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking otherwise they are right to be angry with you for stinging their property.
Don't retract envelopes, post-it in your pocket because it can be embittered that there's no more and you need them right away.
Are you chatting about the privacy of the collegues?
There are no good ways to stop pokins that propagate.
Who did what, with whom?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone about your information (suppositions) about the privacy of your colleagues.
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, do not abuse his trust.
Bury in you the information shared and does not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues are also aware of this.
Do you declare yourself sick for no reason?
When you call the office and you declare yourself sick on the pretext of a heartbreaking pain because you feel bad or you feel you need rest today, think about the fact that your work, your urgent affairs, your missions must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't get into trouble at your colleagues.
If you know in the advance that the next day you will not go to work or that something can happen that would make you stay at home, do not forget to warn your boss and colleagues to avoid them astonishing at your absence the next day.
Frrightness, sniggering, telephone
You immerse yourself in your work but the sneer of your colleagues is brutally pulling it out?
You became, unwittingly, witnessing a phone chat that you would have done better not to listen?
Don't bother your colleagues with humming, singing, talking aloud (which you're leading over their head), kicking, big words or discontent expressed aloud.
They may even disturb if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you accusing others of a mistake?
If your job is not done for the deadline, you forget to send an important letter or message, do not accuse anyone for this forgetting.
Don't put it on the possible chaos in the office or your noisy collegues.
Recognise it if you made a mistake and if it has presented any inconvenience to others, repair the fault.
Ask how you could repair your fault, fix the negligence.
Do you feel too close at home at the office?
Putting a jog and slippers is comfortable at home but they're not suitable for the office.
Don't wear comfortable jogging even if your function allows.
Don't be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing up properly, and if your function requires it by putting pretty and elegant clothes to go to work.
If you want to meet expectations, you're no longer interesting
We move slowly into the usual morning cork.
All in all, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I'm raising the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the tones of all times, then a female choir joins as a real jewel.
Mr.2 broadcasts the song "Wings of Love" by 'agar.
Hungarian musical life has not spoiled us for a long time with good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the plug becomes different if you listen to the new album of 'agar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born of the Hungarian digital underground are not very much starting to change the overall image and, despite the new fashion of garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
He was also from Pécs and he played himself in Yonderboi's group before he embarked on his own lane, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in a shoe".
His project and music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, began to make himself known when he was entrusted with the composition of filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The season of Ferenc Torok).
The initialling of small clubs began to be known by a wider audience when wan2 cited their first album of 2002 among the top 50 records on the Hungarian market and, along with Yonderboi, were the only creators of the Hungarian trend who would also be competitive in the west.
And his whole thing became unquestionably "trendy" but no one asked them if they would wear this label.
The band reacted properly, it released a new and better record.
The recently released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new avenues for them, although the title wishes to represent continuity with years spent in Pécs.
It was a line of the former Pécs group of Balizs.
We're fine with reference to flight but next to aerial music now appears, depending on the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, the impact of rock and roll.
The singer Ligeti, singer currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs at the first album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a real radio hit, mr2 Pet'fi, which has recently been broadcasting popular music from morning to evening, has begun to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
So all is well (?).
hvg.hu asked questions in Balizs Aesger.
hvg.hu: This new tube pushes me to ask a question: Did your music remain music aimed at a certain layer?
The term music for a certain layer doesn't tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, non-alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
So-called alternative, underground music can be equally mediocre and made only to sell them and thus become commercial.
Now, a good pop song can be sincere as well.
The attitude of reception also operates in this spirit independently of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign audiences, is one or the other more open to your music?
Abroad, especially in the west, light music has oldest traditions.
The, people go to concerts and not only young people in the tens of 20s, but also the oldest.
They follow much more carefully the changes that have occurred in light music as they believe that it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or and how many people are listening to your music?
I'm obviously glad to see that more and more people come to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve a goal, but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important at concerts or mutual influence is already functioning but it is only perceived in the elusive changes of the moment.
Now, I noticed that if you wanted to meet the public's expectations, you won't be interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Are you going to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and has been a carrier rather to the west.
We don't really follow his path even if sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
Rather, we are team players who have confidence in each other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, it was of course inevitable that our music would be compared to Yonderboi's because we're several to leave his band and take another path.
hvg.hu: On the palmares of mr2 Petofi, Wings of Love occupies the first place.
Many have heard the name 'agar' for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style you consciously opened up to a wider layer?
We don't plan to make a tube to sell the disk.
This song means more.
We wanted it for the final album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the album.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why are they - what was the guideline?
's.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
We had the idea of composing this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian musical scene.
Thus was composed the six-member choir, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik Hodosi, Juci Németh, who was later named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like this or the girls edited it a little?
This song has been around for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought that something was still missing from this song.
The series of chords attracted the vocals of the song.
I sang at night the melody that girls later learned.
I got it almost right away and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that it galvanized me at the time, but on the safety we needed the Divas.
With my voice she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert too it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except for a brief solo by Judy Jay), they have no role alone, they all sing together and they don't sing louder than music, so music doesn't just accompany their song.
They were behind the scene as well.
Did it want?
's.B.: The fact that they were in the background is only due to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we must forget a little of our ego, forget who comes from, who goes or, we just have to let these wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted others to also feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
Actually, none of the music creation process were involved, we had more difficult pieces when mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, where I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little one little bit, everything came out like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite on the new album?
It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I've already "released" this record.
Right now, it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never the Same.
The treacherous trader risked billions because of his inferiority complex.
A concealing fraudster.
For example, its former employee is the French giant Société Générale, the owner of the Czech bank bank bank.
The bank lost almost EUR 5 billion to it.
Rather, it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, in addition, can in no way be considered incapable.
Unlike all major bankers, he recognized the US mortgage market crisis in time.
"He is fragile", his superiors suggested, who had denounced him to the police.
However, if we stick to Kerviel's statement, reported by the French media, including Le Monde, this man's transactions produced a profit of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year.
The crisis goes beyond the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to win half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
There began information in February that so-called "sub-prime" mortgages granted to low-income clients or those who had encountered repayment difficulties in the past would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he bet well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"As soon as I had won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel said, and added that he didn't, of course, keep anything for himself."
Throughout the interrogation, he confesses to having distorted the reports so as not to be detected.
He managed to deceive his superiors, although the Eurex Stock Exchange began to take an interest in his dealings.
Who doesn't risk anything has nothing
Was he afraid of being discovered?
Pretty much no.
"I thought that the simple fact of getting 1.6 billion for the bank was going to satisfy them."
Where does his desire to risk so great come from?
He reached his post only gradually.
He had started working at Société Générale in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around 51,000 dollars.
Two years later, he was already a trader assistant, and in 2005 he became an independent trader with an annual salary of 90 thousand dollars.
Yet he knew that he would never earn as much as the others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less valued than the others.
In terms of my university degree and my career and staff," Kerviel told investigators.
However, shortly after taking office, he achieved his first great success.
Thanks to Allianz shares, he earned half a billion euros by betting on the fall of this stock in the London bombings.
And the mechanism was triggered -- he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you in peace
"There was like a snowball effect," he told the police.
But the superiors knew everything, or rather, they suspected it.
"As long as I was winning, they were pretending to close their eyes."
However, the blow of the beginning of the year comes.
He is losing EUR 1 billion in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decided to hide the sum.
On Monday, when he gets to work, he is no longer employed from the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost EUR 5 billion to it.
And how did we find out?
He became suspicious because of his leave.
"Last year, I took only four days off.
A trader who does not take a vacation is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another,' Kerviel concludes.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, the Ministers of the Czech Government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could bring EUR 14 billion (approximately 365 billion kroner) to the Czech Republic in the coming years.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion kroner from seven operational programmes will go to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around DKK 100 billion under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the most important operational programme and accounts for up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain under these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of 90.8 billion kroons next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme for SMEs and entrepreneurs is intended to provide financial resources to encourage innovation within the company.
Companies should be able to obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new and more efficient management methods.
Until now, the Czech Republic has been among the new members of the least successful EU funds.
The Tribunal confirmed the sentence of 20 years'imprisonment for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal confirmed on Thursday the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of the country, Arnold Alemon, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 to a fraud of 100 million dollars (nearly DKK 1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released and lived under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether or not the former head of this Central American State, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be once again incarcerated is not clear at the moment.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on the prison officers, either they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or go to prison again.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alemun regularly moved government money to foreign company accounts in Panama.
These were fictitious companies and the accounts actually belonged to the members of his family and his closest supporters.
Some of this money went into the funds that Alemon had created to finance its election campaign in 2001.
The budget has been adopted
That is how it is.
The State budget has been adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the governmental majority without the opposition's support.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - SSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and SSD could not afford his refusal.
Unlike the turbulent debate preceding the vote on the declaration of distrust to the government, this time there is nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies has adopted without any problem this law, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
That is a kind of paradox.
Like it or not, every chapter and every article is the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of the policy, although hidden behind the competition of power between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media, and that's why it's paid more attention in the media.
Political disputes are much more important to opinion than to the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three evils that the current budget is not capable of being regulated at the same time:
The first is the important part of the law-imposed mandate fees, consisting not only of pensions, but also of social security contributions, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" of the SSD and KS-M parties.
The second is a deficit economy, as a result of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the public finance deficit, i.e. the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit of the State budget that is the greatest hazard.
The latter is public and relatively under control.
The real time bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issue stunned bonds, disproportionate debt to their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from money from taxes, tax and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In recent years, they managed to repay these debts by the mass sale of shares in distribution systems, including energy systems, obtained from the State in the context of privatization.
Today, they no longer have this stunt.
If we confine ourselves to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
Our economy has been going through for several years, just as the rest of the world has been growing and it is not enough to sell for it.
It was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
Instead, they were in debt the state more and more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have handled their affairs in a much more reasonable manner than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that falls mostly on previous governments.
We are among the countries on a global scale that are least threatened by poverty.
We therefore do not need massive social programmes which have, unfortunately, been unnecessarily swollen in recent years.
Although some of the absurd populist spending, approved last year before the elections, has been successfully removed if a mismatch in the retirement age limit, as well as a reform of the pension system, will not take place soon, then all policies will cease to exist in that country and anyone in power, it will only be administered.
By barely settling, it can be said that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats distributing mechanically the majority of the money taxed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism whereby ordinary costs are postponed by mandate fees.
The deficit of EUR 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if previous governments had not dissipated all the money they could.
If we really do not want the policies in power to become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what it manages to levy in taxes and tax duties, the calm necessary to prepare new reform laws.
Only the latter will make it possible to gradually achieve a balanced State budget.

Banks Want to Resolve the Crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of England, Switzerland and Canada have decided to jointly combat the financial market crisis.
More than USD 100 billion will be placed in money markets by the auction.
Banks will sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are prepared to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will auction 40 billion dollars, and it will also provide 24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of individual States have decided to take up such concerted action, aimed at preventing or even reducing the effects of the financial crisis.
'This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend,' writes in his report to Bernard Baumohl's clients of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group.
"The concerted action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 per cent to about 50 per cent," Baumohl adds in his report.
Banks have already lost .60 billion dollars to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts still expect further losses in billions.
'If the central banks have chosen this approach, it is because they have to really grasp what can still happen,' says ABN Chief Economist Amro Kieran Davies.
'It seems that the situation is really bad,' he adds.
Central banks fear that, if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more dearly to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the US economy into a recession that could affect economic growth around the world.
The central banks made this choice after it was not possible to lower the interbank rate of London, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks still feared mutual borrowing, despite the fact that the US, Canadian and English Central Banks had repeatedly declined their interest rates during the fall.
'It will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates,' said Tempus Consulting's Reuters agency Greg Salvaggio.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks’ approach will not help avert the crisis, as it does not solve the main problem of the collapse of the US housing market.
President Klaus: Greens' debates are incredible
Global climate change is expected to be detrimental mainly to developing countries.
President Vaclav Klaus has spoken again on the issue of global warming.
This time, criticism has come up against the UN International Climate Change Conference ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he said that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, which is a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organisations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric accompanying it and the reality.
'The debate is not structured there at all, it's just a rocket of words, ersatz solutions to the current problems,' said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed, during the presentation of his book, that his subject is of great importance to him, and that is why he is committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction at the fact that his book also appeared in German translation, since, he said, "I often only meet the caricature of my opinions".
Interested people can now read its positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climate scientist, he nevertheless had, in his view, enough provisions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academic who can follow and appreciate scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics and is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following the following arguments: the climate is constantly changing, so the changes in the book are normal, there is no opinion shared by all the researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too great nor too serious, so they represent no danger and, finally, the efforts made to influence climate change are useless, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
All the more so since he had the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considered it unacceptable to impose inveral opinions on others, which he felt was a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "a reasonable protection of the environment, but against a fundamental environmentalism which does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring".
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken on this subject two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 000 people failed to renew their driving licence on time
Six hundred thousand drivers allowed the deadline to expire and failed to renew their old driving licence, which was valid for the end of the year.
This is the last day when people can still apply for renewal, so that the authorities can issue a new permit to them before the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid licence will use the road.
According to the authorities, their driving licence has not been renewed, especially those who no longer wish to drive.
While municipalities report a drop in the number of applications for renewal of the permit, the authorities in the capital are being flooded with applications and the number of applications for the renewal of the permit has increased this week.
The City Council satisfied about 2,000 customers a day.
There's a tail of about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licences.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to request the issue within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred kroner.
Vehicle drivers who fail to complete the compulsory renewal of the driving licence by the end of the year and will be travelling without a valid permit will be liable to a fine as of January.
The culprit shall be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand kroons.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence by resorting to an amicable procedure.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to DKK 2,500.
According to previous reports, it was likely to be fined even a person who was not travelling.
In doing so, it could be forced to pay up to DKK 30,000.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to be moderating and to impose fines that did not exceed 1000 kroons.
According to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one is at risk of fines in the tens of thousands.
The driving licence is, in his view, a document that people can decide whether they wish to have it or not.
It is not as with the identity card, which must be valid without exception.
People who no longer want to drive should give their driving licences.
All you have to do is bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with documents dating from 1994 to 2000 are still three years old to carry out the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, these are about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal reduced the penalties for detective pacts with Berdych
Former police officers accused of connivance with David Berdych's gang Josef Opava and Petr Kosuk will be in prison for thirteen and ten years respectively.
The Prague High Court sentenced them to a final sentence by one year and two years, respectively.
Originally, the detectives of the Department for Combating Organized Crime were subject to penalties of 14 and 12 years'imprisonment.
It is no longer possible to call against the judgement held today, only an appeal to the High Court is conceivable.
Although Berdych is also charged in this case, he is currently only awaiting the first instance verdict.
However, he has already received sentences in other trials, the sum of which exceeds 16 years'imprisonment.
He cannot receive more.
In January, the Departmental Tribunal found guilty of participating in 19 persons, the High Court of First Instance now dealing with the appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the accused had been calling, since the beginning of the investigation, in question the prosecution, claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemia Court of Justice, police officers, after an agreement, inter alia, with Berdych, passed on information from police sources to criminals, covered the various hold-ups and helped members of the gang to avoid criminal liability.
The gang returned 30 percent of the theft to Opava and Koiak.
The prosecution refers to the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially, armed robbery, including victims, in most cases, have suffered serious health damage, but also from the abuse of power by a public official and prohibited weapons.
During the home searches, the police discovered illegally detained pistols, shells with a steel core, a direct laser firing viewfinder or a machine gun.
According to the accusations, the gang has been enriched with tens of millions of kroner.
Apart from nearly 20 men in this trial, the courts have already found other Berdych handbags and a range of others guilty.
Other men in the vicinity of Berdych are still explaining themselves in court in another trial, and some cases have not yet reached the court.
The main hearing has averted, for the time being, Tomo Pata and Maro-zulej, who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of child substitution: 12 million
The lawyer for the affected families Igor Veleba wants to obtain compensation of 12 million kroner 12 million more costs from the hospital in Tob.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for fathers and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each of the parents.
That is why the lawyer at the Ond-ej Dostul hospital has absolutely no agreement with Veleba's proposal.
'We reject such a claim, it is very high,' said Dostel at the end of the hearing.
"In order to be able to form an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report that the opposing party has commissioned to draft.
We're going to check whether it has any explanatory value.
But we continue to believe that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands,' said Dostel.
According to him, the amount should be set at between 100,000 and 200,000 euros for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloyov family asked for one million kroner for each month when they could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, drafted for him by the university hospital in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological harm and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation was better borne by men, although they were confronted with the remorse for not being able to prevent the substitution of newborns.
Women, on the other hand, remain less serene in the face of the experience of trauma in the news and in the face of what is happening at the moment, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were substituted by nurses at the hospital in Tobbo on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola's home to the zermuk in Pzibyslavice and Veronika at Libor Bro' and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablozov.
The governor of the Vysozina region, Mr. Vystril, at the end of October, handed over to each of the families 100 000 kroons for the reimbursement of the expenses caused by the error of the hospital in Toebo managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally obliged to third-party liability insurance.
In the event of a breach, they must draw on the reserve fund, exceptionally, they may ask the manager for help.
Until now, the courts have received relatively low compensation, and the amounts calculated from the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polovka has lost Valaskatrich (the Kingdom of Vala'sko)
Bolek Polovka lost the dispute over the trade mark Valaské krolovstvova (Kingdom of Vala'sko).
According to the Ostrava Regional Court judge, he was actually the first-time user of the title King of Valaisko, but the project was set up by the team around Toma Harabi, former collaborator of the actor.
Polavka was not present at today's audience.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harbis and his team are interfering about Bolek Polavka's popularity," Polavka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Valaisko evoke precisely this actor and comedian.
Harabis is the same view.
"There is a work behind us of almost ten years.
Searching for money and setting out events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
'After years, they have realised that the project is successful and could benefit from it.
They want to parasitize our work,' he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polovka who first used the title of Valaiska kril (King of Valaisko) in his television programme.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohat was crowned him as a king in 1993.
However, at the time, this had nothing to do with the plan to set up a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabis came up with the idea of publishing passports from the Valaiské Krovstva.
From a humorous action originally, a business and a lucrative business, followed by the creation, by Harabis, of the company Valaské Kr-lovstv.
In 1997 he agreed that his name and signature should be cited in the passport and he even offered the holders the sale of the visit to his farm and his theatre performances.
Who is going to sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabia merely used the naked idea, published by Polavka in the Mané programme, for commercial purposes.
'The popularity of Boleslav Polovka has certainly helped the Valaiské Kr-lovstva project,' said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was constituted by Harabia and her team, which was working on the project intensively.
The collaboration between the now-entnamed parties continued until 2000 when Harabia organized an official coronation for Polavka in Vseton.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polavka a Harabi, who culminated in the deposition "of King Boleslav I voted forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabia, assumed by the singer Jarmila as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polavka filed a complaint against Harasai and his company, requesting that the court have now rejected.
What could shed light on the matter is the tournament for the throne and half of the princess.
A new king should come out of it.
He didn't want to betray the details and the date yet.
"We don't want to go fast in a job.
It would be something like the parade of the kings in Slovenia.
The king would be elected for a while.
Even Mr Polavka can, of course, register", added Harabia.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: diparture of prejudice
Actually, I've never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were not extraordinary, the quality of gear shifting, driving and also manufacturing could, in many respects, be described as below-average.
However, there is currently its successor the Peugeot 207, which is much better on the market.
All the more so since the combi named SW is going a step further, all I have to do is think better.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback I was complaining, for example, about head space on the back seats.
So here the complaints are over because the combi body means that even the great devils will, in this respect, be comfortable.
Let's see quickly
I will refer very quickly to the inside so that I do not repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty successful design, my only remark about the central tunel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, given that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when one could complain about seats or too short back is over.
The lateral guidance has also improved markedly compared to the model 206.
As for space, the increase in the dimensions of the bodywork is also sensitive.
The combi also sees the lack of space above the head already mentioned.
A trunk in the trunk
The most important thing about this vehicle is therefore its luggage back.
I have to rate this one as very well accessible (also thanks to the rear pivoting ice) and a rather easy stowage.
The blind spaces are provided with stop elastics which constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold heavy ailez objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
According to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a rather average figure in relation to the competition.
Apart from the zkoda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in this category in the Czech Republic.
Comparing the 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav's product, the Peugeot remains very substantially behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to going on holiday abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I were to highlight the advantages, I would mention the underbody remaining after the back seats were overturned perfectly straight, or a very low footstep.
120 horses spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with an Otto four-cylinder engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, that's what a 1.6 that makes a family hatchback work look like.
It is silent, consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by the zkoda that often gives the impression of having a muffled muffled muffled with a mop, then I can only be enthusiastic.
Let's go through the rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable for all.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a fairly well-equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4-litre engine amounting to EUR 329,900 is still fair.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 K, which is enough.
The Premium equipment, which is also tested, increases the price of EUR 80,000.
Now, we have arranged in addition to head airbags, an automatic air conditioning, automatic windshields, an automatic control of the rear windows...
In fact, the vehicle ultimately costs 531 900 K.
That's a lot, but try adding the extra equipment to the Fabia price and you'll get a very similar number.
All that remains to do is to choose the mark.
The integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is not working
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, which is causing concerns among remaining concerns about the development of local education.
For the time being, the integration of Eastern Europeans is encountering a number of obstacles.
The British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the inhabitants of origin are turning into violence.
The case of northern Kent, where conflicts remain and immigrants of Slovak origin are beginning to increase, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Disputes, baffles and fights between students have been translated into parent-to-parent relations.
The situation went so far that the police arrested a 10-year-old student in Chatham, who was hitting a 10-year-old student with an iron bar.
The culprit defends herself by claiming that the boy had insulted him with rasists.
The police had also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant by two adolescent girls.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
"When we got home, a young man climbed the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered with apples and pears and then he discovered his buttocks," described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the remaining people went so far as to describe conflicts with immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases referred to above show that the atmosphere in British schools between the inhabitants of origin and the immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70,000 Slovaks who came to find work were registered in Great Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your holidays can be achieved if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches such as snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and the inclusive all with servers offering you pizza, ice or intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you are not going to find this list in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Greater Antilles.
In the time of the Spaniards, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the depot and trans-shipment of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported in Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was erected in the early 1920s.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who built it, since everything that was a crime in the United States (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among its customers, there were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew and cars, belonging to the religious symbols of the 1950s of the last century, were circulating on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojomar he had his yacht.
Showbusiness stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
And now then?
You can leave your autograph yourself on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars are still in circulation in Havana, since jigoulis and previously imported fiats have long, in such a salty and humid climate.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is substantially decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity there are as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places are becoming more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Given that tourism brings the money if necessary, its development is the green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of the province of Holguin, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane had returned from the extensive plantations in the sugar mills on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades, and this is how small locomotives can be seen in operation, the contemporary of which are only in museums.
Where to lead his steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the best-known places.
So there is no need to write a lot about Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise, let us recall that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that the one who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The valley of Vizales to the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
Exhorious vegetation grows on limestone soil.
Mogotes, limestone balloons and rocks rise in the candle from the bottom of the valley, and, fertile soil having caught their bowels, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense plant carpet.
The valley is the place where Cuban tobacco of the best quality is probably grown.
You will be able to meet the final shape of this product if you visit one of the cigar factories in Havana.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major 'eman was shot.
Trinidad
Ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It was the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought it glory and wealth.
The wealth was incarnated in the beauty and window-storey character of this small city.
Koloni-ln-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is a place so far apart that in the 1950s of the last century, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay out of the way.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything, everyone was just having a roof over their heads.
If you have more time in Trinidad than an afternoon, then it is worth also going to see interesting places in the vicinity, such as Playa Ancan Beach or the Sugarrian Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Musica, which comes alive after sunset and where the music only sits in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this village located in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful on the island.
This view is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads that lead to it from Guantanamo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross an almost unmarked landscape of human activity.
UNESCO has inscribed the eastern skew of Cuba, thanks to its unspoiled landscape, on the world heritage list.
The best chocolate is made there, in church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in reality, it was born about a hundred years after the journey of Columbus) and from the hill where the former castle-fort and the current El Castillo Hotel stands, we see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain range, the Bay of Sow and the Isla de Pinos Island, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions practised by the descendants of the ancient slaves, about all this one could fill a quantity of pages.
Only, as they say, it is better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, say Americans
The lack of troops and necessary equipment, according to the United States, influences the conduct of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission to Afghanistan is not going on as it should, representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country have agreed in Edinburgh in Scotland.
In addition to the Taliban movement’s growing challenge, the eight states involved are now also discussing future plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States, through Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO troops have been called on NATO troops this week, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the Afghan government’s authority and the intensification of development aid.
"The development in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the people to start a new development of the economy and security themselves", British Defence Minister Des Browne told BBC.
Ninety per cent
The activity of Afghan insurgents is, according to data from the United States military, the most intense of the last five years.
The number of violent actions has increased by 27 per cent over the past year, to 60 per cent in Helmand province, which is in the south of the country.
NATO countries have about 400,000 troops in Afghanistan, nearly a quarter of them in the southern part.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they call for other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
'We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them,' said Gates.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop today made similar remarks.
"I'm not happy with what we have on land and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that lasted three days.
Which is passive
In recent months, there have also been a gap between the countries involved in the conflicts over the issue if all the allies are indeed doing their utmost in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans in Afghanistan have a relatively large representation.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat requirements they are subject to are not as stringent as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate,' said Gates.
The British tabloid Sun this week described the German soldiers as lazy.
"The Afghan lazy people discovered: the Germans are playing, while ours are fighting," Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tenies.
The German newspaper Bild went on counterattack by publishing a picture of a British troupe during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
The state debt will rise to one trillion in 2009
The burden of a State debt exceeding NOK 84,000 rests with each Czech Republic.
The total debt rose to kroner 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.0 billion kroner this year.
As a result of a better-than-expected change in the State budget economies, the Ministry has reduced the amount planned to SEK 152.8 billion.
The State of the Czech Republic's debt rose towards the end of September to DKK 842.7 billion.
So during the nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
However, from June onwards, it fell by DKK 13.4 billion.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its State debt data from early October.
The burden of a debt exceeding DKK 84,000 rests with each Czech.
Throughout the past year, the state fell into more than KKD 111 billion.
"For the time being, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit expected for next year, the border could be exceeded by a trillion kroner only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one trillion kroner," said Patria Finance analyst David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
The forecast of Next Finance analyst Vladimur Pikor is similar: 'We could exceed one trillion in 2009.
The precise date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the situation on the polar scene was changing, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I do not expect this change,' he said.
Dependencies are growing
The State's debt is the debts of the central government and is generated mainly by the accumulation of deficits in the State budget.
The State's debt is financed by treasury bills, rents, direct loans or, for example, loans to the European Investment Bank.
The State's domestic debt has so far increased this year from 38.5 billion to NOK 719.4 billion.
The State's external debt has so far increased from DKK 1.7 billion to NOK 123.3 billion.
The so-called trade-trade negotiable debt reached NOK 803.3 billion at the end of September and from June it fell by DKK 13.7 billion.
The average accountability of the State's debt was 6.5 years.
"Total debt increased inter-annually from the first to the third quarter by 13 per cent, which is, given the current health of the economy, too high a figure.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by annuity securities, where it reaches 20 per cent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be room for negotiation when the pension reform comes,' commented the Pikora data.
Better than what we expected
The 2007 strategy for financing and managing the State debt for 2007 that the government had planned to borrow 159.52 billion kroner this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to a better-than-expected change in the State budget, the Ministry reduced the amount planned to SEK 152.8 billion.
The sum is essentially the deficit in the State budget, which is clearly worth KKWN 76 billion this year, in place of the NOK 91.3 billion.
Secondly, these are the maximum sources foreseen for the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely NOK 13.3 billion, the reserve of EUR 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of State annuity securities for DKK 43 billion and the repayments of the European Investment Bank's loans amounting to DKK 1.8 billion.
She appeared before a court in Khartoum today for appointing a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days'imprisonment and deportation, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of allowing students between the ages of 6 and 7 to give Muhammad's name to a teddy bear when any depiction of the Prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was liable to whipping.
The 54-year-old British teacher at the Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested on Sunday at home and charged with the attack on Islam and sedition under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints of relatives from the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asks her students, aged 6/7, to choose a name for the class's teddy bear.
“Eight names come out of the mouths of the children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says school principal Robert Boulos.
Eventually, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their favorite first name.
Muhammad is, of course, the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common forename in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the bear photo followed by the caption “My name is Mohamed”.
The bear itself had no label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the depiction of the prophet as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in the Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that might be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she had asked the children to vote for a name", it was only an 'innocent mistake'.
A review shared by many of the teacher's students describing her as "very caring for her students" and "who never speaks of religion in class".
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Great Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honouring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can we give it, for example, to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They did not reach agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians concluded a sixth and final session of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning without having been able to overcome their differences over the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were not able to reach a status agreement", European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger told a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “at stake”, its United States counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to fulfil their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
'The immediate violence is not expected, but we are entering a very difficult period,' he added, noting that 'obvious voltages exist'.
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for a final time on Monday.
The future of the province, 90% of Albanian-speaking, could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final negotiating session since the troika was entrusted with a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, are insisting on continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
'Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,' said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of Kosovo's UN administration, Westerners believe that EU-supervised independence is the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to proclaim it unilaterally whether the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
'Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached,' the President of the Kosovo Autonomous Authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the Baden Hotel, where these 'last-chance negotiations have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, a former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, expressed his regret.
But he added that Belgrade's autonomy plan “is part of a past that led to murders and deportations”.
“Domino effect”
Serbian President Boris Tadic, for his part, felt that a compromise was always possible, warning the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the independence of the province.
Belgrade claims, in particular, to fear a “domino effect” in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
'For Serbia,' he said, 'this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.'
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be taken exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally had the right of veto.
"The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word"
“Only a solution in the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia,” said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council.”
To the journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu replied that “the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on status”, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking people would be “in consultation” with the West.
Bush snatches an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference convened by him on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to enter into immediate negotiations with a view to finding a final settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must put an end to its settlement activities, said Bush, reminding both sides of their "road map" obligations that they accepted in 2003.
The White House leader stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues".
This name covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees expelled from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US President, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations should be "overall and in-depth" and cover all aspects of a regulation, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others".
In turn, Olmert pledged to be "direct and continuous" and to make an effort to complete them in the course of 2008 "
At the end of 2008, Bush set the deadline for the implementation of his co-exist "two-state two-state" Palestinian and Israeli states.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had secured a commitment to that effect from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, D.C., is the source of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it tackles the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," said Prince Saoud in his interview with the Saudi-owned Arabic-language daily.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As with this type of fact each time, official versions and rumours are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation by the Inspectorate-General of the National Police (IGPN), a police car was travelling on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
'She was not in intervention but on patrol, and was travelling at 40-50 km/h, without gyrophare,' explains one police source.
A Kawazaki green motorcycle, “uncertified, so not allowed to run on public roads” (see below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was “very fast”.
“She hit the police car on her left, after a priority denial to the right,” says one policeman.
The inspection of blood alcohol on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (front smashed, starred windshield, bumper torn) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very soon yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation for “acts of manslaughter and non-assistance to person in danger” at the IGPN, co-checked with the departmental directorate of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor said that the IGPN investigation at that stage had ruled out the responsibility of the police officers.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, heard on Sunday evening, confirmed “the police version that this mini-motorb has arrived relatively quickly on their left”.
Yesterday, a kind of groove, probably caused by the friction of the pillows on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained entangled while the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the policemen had very quickly left the premises, thus not helping the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out “any serious fault” with regard to this point.
'This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, on which to be very careful,' said a police source.
Liberation met with an eyewitness of those moments following the accident.
One of his windows giving precisely on the stage.
"We immediately went downstairs, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive them," said the witness.
There was nothing to be done."
He then saw "a completely hagard policeman, who was drinking.
Two more were trying to resuscitate one of the young people, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
In the face of the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and it seems, to the certainty that those present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen were taken by car by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
According to the witness, the rescuers arrived “about 20 minutes after the departure of the police officers”.
They also performed cardiac massage, to no avail.
“I will not say that the police have not provided assistance to young people.
These young people were rescued.
The firefighters arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them,' the prosecutor stressed.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police cracked down on the first protests on Monday since the state of emergency was introduced two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the eastern city of Lahore, some 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency were injured by the tear gas canisters used by the security forces, according to witnesses.
The latter responded with stone-throwing, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Karachi and Rawalpindi-like scenarios, or police officers loaded and injured lawyers.
Several were reportedly arrested.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced protests, following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the gathering.
Other demonstrations are reported to have taken place in Multan (central) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement on Monday received the support of the religious parties grouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose President '' urged the population to send flowers to the judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and litter to those who swore an oath before Musharraf'.
''Musharraf's promise no longer holds'
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly targeted by the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday evening.
It was expected to decide in the next few days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential election, on 6 October, by indirect suffrage, of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was ousted and replaced.
''Everything we see is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to Supreme Court rulings'', the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army and become a civilian 'do more' president after the establishment of a state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
His military uniform was expected to drop by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
Moreover, the Pakistani government has denied insistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf was under house arrest by his deputy army chief.
More than one third of pregnancies remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 per cent) as well as births that are not foreseen or have occurred in an unexpected manner.
Even today, more than one in three pregnancies (36 per cent) is not planned, according to a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the passage of the Neuwirth Act, which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 per cent) as well as births that are not foreseen or have occurred in an unexpected manner.
The various methods of contraception such as the pill or IUD still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, according to Ined.
However, the liberalization of contraception has allowed for a better “fertility control”, according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5 per cent in 1970 to 60 per cent today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated in the near future for one in five couples and if possible in spring, a season judged to be the most pleasant for having a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It took more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew comrades from the International Space Station (ISS) to carry out the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, which is essential for the station's scientific activities.
A risky exit that has accumulated records due to its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, tools "crafted" by astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday as the astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the telephone Discovery, a large cylindrical piece to soon accommodate European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of landing dock for laboratory modules.
But they must be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew's second task was therefore to move a solar power generation module weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began redeploying the module's solar panels, which have a wingspan of 76 metres.
And that's where one of the panels, unfolding like accordions, was damaged on nearly a meter by a cable that got stuck.
Deployment was halted so as not to further damage the sign.
The astronauts, who were originally intended to perform a check-out of the shuttle Discovery, then to repair another solar panel with a faulty rotation system, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to caracolate at the end of the 30 meters length of the remote-controlled shuttle arm added to the station to carry out the repair.
It is one of the best spacewalkers in NASA.
Large, strong, very skilful, it has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, the training doctor was therefore instructed to “operate” the “injured” solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he severed the faulty cable and installed some sort of “splies” on the damaged area.
He was aided by a second "spacewalker" remaining near the airlock and, from the inside, by the other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey machine wrapped with insulation to prevent electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "designed" by astronauts on board the station.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making an inventory of his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts were enjoying a half-day relaxation before seven astronauts today returned to the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
EADS title aptagmed on the stock exchange
The EADS share is currently declining sharply on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the Aeronautics and Defence Group announced that it would have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion to cope with the A400M's delays.
EADS currently loses EUR 21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its forecast of operating income for 2007 following the delays caused by the slow increase in the development of the A400M engine, which is a condition for the aircraft's maid flight.
The cost of making up for the delay in the delivery of its military aircraft, announced in October, is 'between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than EUR 1 billion for Airbus', has announced the parent company of European manufacturer EADS.
As a result of these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating income targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without further quantification.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new loads is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS' operating income fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to costs related to delays in another programme, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspense on Sunday at the end of the polls: the Russians will go massively for President Putin’s united party.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, or even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending voters a televised message on public channels, which has already been recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the top of the list of united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory promises to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the President did not allow anything to be seen by receiving foreign ambassadors, merely giving a new charge against the West accused of interference - its theme of choice during the campaign.
“We know the price of a true democracy and want honest, transparent and open elections, elections without snapshots,” he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from the point of view.
She denounced a campaign tainted by pressure.
The communist leader Gennadi ziuganov said that there had "never had such a dirty election, even in the time of the Yeltsin".
Following the crackdown on last weekend's protests, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, continues to be banned according to his lawyer.
“The Russians have retained the mentality of homo sovieticus”
Behind these unsolved legislative elections are two much more open questions:
- Who will succeed Putin as President?
The Official Gazette yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
No successor emerges.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, in both legislative and presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“Russians have retained the mentality of homo sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their destiny,” said sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada.
Historian Nikolay Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes further: civil society has fallen behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin returned to the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease,” says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians “spoilfully relinquish personal responsibility” they had briefly demonstrated after the break-up of the USSR.
"What's the point of thinking?"
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business community.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (over 85 heads of Russian regions) direct the local lists of united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Public opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for extremists either.
Conclusion by Tamara Cherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: "What is the point of thinking?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them? ”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were previously available only for “humanitarian” purposes, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or his or her successors in title.
The eleven States in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
With the completion of the ratification of this agreement by all States, the opening has been in place since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Access by historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to conduct research “including the movement of prisoners, the camp population and the state of health of the forced labourers”, explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, opposed the opening of these nominative documents to the public, because of the sensitivity of certain information.
Like the supposed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The registers of the concentration camps or arrest warrants prepared by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for practical purposes: to locate civilians who were deported or subjected to compulsory work and, possibly, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are processing tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to waiting for from these documents,” said Professor Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at the Technische University in Berlin in 2006.
EU and India want to reach free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, bilateral Indo-European trade is already reaching almost EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
EU Foreign Ministers last April gave the European Commission the go-ahead to start negotiations to sign Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its largest foreign investor, but India is only the EU's ninth trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact will give a huge boost to both economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans", justified Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second largest market for each of the top ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner.The Asian and European giants exchange annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "ten billion euros of services", said Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has not yet reached its potential.President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering Pound10 billion over five weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday was anxious to ease the current return to concerns about credit conditions, and announced a supply of ten billion pounds at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
"To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve input during the maintenance period starting on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," she said in a statement.
The bank states that Pound10 billion (EUR 14 billion) will be put on the market on 6 December at 12.15 a.m. GMT, at the base rate and until 10 January.
This is the first time it seems that the BoE has put liquidity on the market at five weeks in an open market operation.
These are normally one week away.
The BoE adds in its press release that it "deplores itself to take further steps to maintain the rates" of interbank loans on a daily basis in line with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5.829% Wednesday.
The three-month rate was 6.6 per cent, one higher since 18 September.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the money placed on the market by the Bank of England had been accompanied by a high penalty rate that had deterred banks from using it.
According to rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the price of the pound vis-à-vis the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums placed on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to consider PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused on Thursday to discuss the articles of the Socialist Purchasing Power Bill, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text listed some 10 measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS, including the increase of 50% of the employment premium, the re-establishment of the floating TIPP, a transport voucher or rent management.
As UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes to 115), the sitting was closed at the end of the general discussion, which gave rise to exchanges, sometimes lively, between the majority and opposition a few hours before the televised intervention of Nicolas Sarkozy on purchasing power.
PS leader Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent all of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft budget amendment considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is being built
Following many rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announced the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with Festival Republic by British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it is an honour to work with someone who has, no more and no less, inspired the current festival movement in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produced the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival is scheduled to be held from 8 to 10 August on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which annually attracted some 80,000 people.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006, Festival Republic premiered the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury as the "most inspiring event" he ever attended, Charlie Jones de C3 said that his company and Melvin Benn's company were working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We chose Philadelphia as our market and worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Jones.
"We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been mired in politicians because of the current administration,” says Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to talk to Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after standing out in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of Euro9.8 million and Euro11.3 million respectively in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
'The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, while ours rather take place in urban green spaces,' says Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both a European and American-style film festival impression.'
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The community of Vineland, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the holding of this event,” says Jones.
He refuses to reveal the terms of the understanding, but says 'they are interesting enough to allow them to invest in such an event and to host a festival that hopefully will have a long life.'
Charlie Jones says the festival's capacity is "very big", as is the ability of 80,000 people from the Bonnaroo Music Festival at Tennessee.
He said that invitations had been issued to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed when it came to the press.
"Vineland will be rock-flavoured, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers," says Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, were Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to attract the Hollywood movie trays to Montreal when no one but Terminator objects...
This seductive task is part of the functions of delegate.
A term - 'politically difficult' because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the 'runaway productions'.
Is it difficult to play in the feet of the 'Governator'?
'You have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it's going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she goes there.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge the best,' he says.
The race for festivals
For the time being, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of cinema here.
The Oscar race has begun.
It will be at all West Side festivals, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, talk about presenting Quebec films, highlighting them, and ensuring that directors do interviews.
The Dark Age had a beautiful window at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil premiered in Santa Monica and will be shown at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks before the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands hoping for the arrival of the traditional year-end rally.
However, this year the experts are not as sure as this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December on the stock market generally has positive behaviour.
However, forecasts should not be made exclusively based on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainties in the markets, at least in the short term ".
Although they are not in favour of the stock exchange gaining momentum during the final weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market feeds on the existence of liquidity, willing to invest in the lack of collateral, especially fixed income, affected by the flight towards quality values both in long periods of time and in short periods".
To do this, they believe that the stock market will behave rather lateral, not free from volatility "above all because we know the impact of the odd decline in Fed rates, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of boosting inflationary pressures"
Javier Barrio, head of BPI's sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
'It's not the best thing,' says the expert.
The Spanish stock exchange index, Ibex, has lost almost 4% since 8 November when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganisation of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to the pension schemes that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert qualified that things will be a little different this year since he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the celebration of the celebration of the celebration of the celebration of the Constitution (December 6).
The analyst does not consider volatility to affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst of Inversis Banco, assesses that we are close to the technical levels and 'that is why we could see a twist of the index that could be provoked on the information that is coming from the European Union with regard to the consequences of the crisis on the credit market'.
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading the Ibex to new maximum coats.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year is the return of great values to him".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco claims that the increases will be taken by the bank and industry.
Constructors will also be able to benefit from this rally, if they do so.
'ACS for several months has been picking up positions and we hope that other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path,' the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be protagonist in the latter part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that tech companies will do so very well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
In the last seven years, only on two occasions December has been a bearish month.
The authentic year-end rally took place in 2003, during which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the tech bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, the month of December recorded an increase of 6.68 per cent.
It will be necessary to see whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of winnings (for the time so the Ibex has increased by 8.36 per cent since January) and whether it succeeds in computerization on its year-end rally.
The Banque Populaire will open 200 offices open 12 noon from Monday to Saturday
Banque Populaire has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 are banks located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Populaire Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish bodies, since it was the first group that decided to start to betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8.30 p.m., and to open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8.30 p.m.
Another group that has also repeatedly reiterated that it would like to amplify the hours of its branches, BBVA, although it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with the trade unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturdays instead of opening an afternoon, but not for the public.
The results of the experience of the Banque Populaire will be decisive if other agencies are to join or not to this initiative, which coincides with the schedules of the shops.
It is precisely this objective that the People's Bank is seeking.
Attract autonomous customers who travel in these areas to shop in SMEs and shops on the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 branches throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not about opening new agencies but about renovating existing ones.
To this end, the organization will modernise the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of schedules is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new, more up-to-date design with brighter colors.
The bank sales manager, Angel Rivera, says that this renovation does not involve large investments, but the hiring of staff, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
Agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Banque Populaire has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as explained by Angel Rivero.
The branches of the streets of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Via in Madrid are the streets to have been chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
Banque Populaire currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the brand name of Mundocredit, which specializes in the case of immigrants, also with very ample schedules, which open even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers,' notes Rivero.
So far, they have reached an agreement with Telefonica to sell mobile phones, with staff external to the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the stock market value of its rival Antena 3
We got there.
With this sentence Paolo Vasile, a telecinco executive adviser, expressed his satisfaction yesterday at the close of the stock market when he found that the channel he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect tarnished his joy: 'what hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more but that we have lowered less', he said.
However, he stressed that on a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain stabilized its loss at 15.66 per cent over the past year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday sold 1.52 % and which has been accumulating a 40.5% decline since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of other publicly traded companies is 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million in the case of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Daas) and 1.779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is due to the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we make a profit in terms of audience.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year the first television channel to surpass the 1,000 million gross advertising revenue, as Giuseppe Tringali, the executive adviser of Telecinco and Publiespaia, the group's advertising subsidiary, assured.
For this data to be real, the television channel is expected to record a 3.6 per cent increase in its advertising billing for the current year compared to 965.4 million in the 2006 financial year.
Net billing for Antenna 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million), while net television revenues increased by 0.7 per cent (660.4 million).
One of the factors that annalists point to for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the important pay-out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarria distributed 100% of the profit between its shareholders.
Vasile says that, although it is early to take a decision, this ratio could vary after the 33% purchase of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
'We have the official compromise to give a small 50%, although we have always said much more.
This year I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given securities with the 33% Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced his profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they say, to the projected decline in income growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same company decreased the forecast of Antennae's earnings 3 to 4.5 per cent in 2008 and 7.5 per cent in 2009.

Congress approves transposition of Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In addition to its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the Congressional vote of the amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the year ends.
Representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the effort made by deputies and senators to negotiate and make the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activity of organizations so that markets function effectively.
The Mifid, which modifies the Securities Market Act, involves the modernization of financial markets, at a time when it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the directors of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial consulting services for specialised social reasons and natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting companies (FIAs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and holding companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions in financial instruments, so that it is possible to add multilateral trading systems and order-internationalization systems to regulatory secondary markets, which compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment firms to disclose on the market information on key aspects of its business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they conduct, to facilitate control by CNMV.
Through the Congressional Economics Commission, several changes have been added, including one that highlights that the outstanding debts will be considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been shown with what has happened with the debt of high-risk US mortgages (subprim).
Moreover, they took advantage of the transposition of management took the opportunity to legally delimit the functions that economic graduates can have 30 years after the royal decree was approved, the royal decree, which delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, which will not require the authorization of the CNMV and which will be able to lend its product marketing and attracting new clients to different investment firms at the same time.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices increases by five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which is subsequently used by Eurostat to include it in the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on the evolution of prices in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The leading indicator is calculated using the same process used for the Harmonised Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information on which it is not yet available at the time.
INE recalled that the information provided by the leading indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data that will be revealed on 14 December.
The CPI will continue at relatively high levels
The second Vice-President and the Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, said that the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November is a "time figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue on "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes clarified in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential over monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a large increase.
"We had hoped for an figure of around 4%", acknowledged the Minister for the Economy in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock EUR 42 000 000 million over three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen to more than 2.5% to Pound12,000 million (EUR 16 800 million) since it entered a crisis in mid-September and had to rely on an emerging credit from the Bank of England.
At that point, it amass a few record deposits above Pound25,000 million, a figure that is gradually falling in two and a half months because of the distrust of its customers and despite the 100% guarantee of that money that the government has offered and which it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the organization with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to seize over a quarter of the UK banks’ revenues that will be deposited in the next three years to get the remaining Pound18,000 million until the 30,000 million target is reached.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known for its cheerful advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to obtain its goal.
Northern Rock named the Virgin Association's offer this week, in which three other companies participate, including his favorite to save him from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested today in the early morning the current mayor of the Murcian commune of Totana (of the People's Party) because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption fabric discovered this week.
AD plus, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the chief of police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martinez Andreo replaced the Sunday last May, Juan Morales, the current right-wing Member of Parliament, and so far a municipal councillor of the town hall, who, according to the sources of the inquiry consulted by the SER chain, could be the 'leader' of this frame.
Officers continue to search the municipal and urban planning council spaces and the possibility of new arrests are not ruled out in the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales's lawyer, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot, discovered at the beginning of this semine, was attributed.
As the SER Chaîne reported yesterday to the lawyer of the 'people's party's deputy Juan Morales, he was arrested on leaving Morales's house with important documentation in his possession of the frame.
Moreover, according to sources of the investigation, the subject of the investigation is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange in exchange to facilitate the signing of an urban agreement with a company constructor of the gallevy to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At present, there are eight detainees.
Bono agrees to lead the Spanish Socialist Party candidacy for Toledo and preside over Congress if they win elections
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez, to be the head of the Spanish Socialist Party's list for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
For example, the organizing secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced this during a press conference after the meeting that took place at the federal headquarters of the party with the same party.
The Head of the Executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to rely on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
Moreover, he stressed that 'yes it seems' that the politician of La Mancha will be the candidate of the Socialist Group who will preside over the Congress if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Maron as President of Congress, who made his decision public on 15 November to not run in the next general election and to abandon his political career to focus on the fight against climate change in the academic context.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned him two years ago.
Moreover, he remarked that, although the citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or scream" and to make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems lamentably that the only local in Madrid where one cannot speak quietly and calmly is Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Maron and "his know-how" and he did not want to act as if he was already in office not to fall, as he pointed out, in what his opponents might consider to be "dominance".
Climate propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change subjects both sceptics of its predictions to persecution without mercy and those who give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement who is President of the Government such as zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a “new contract for the planet”.
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government has made a decisive contribution to the European Union being the leader of the European Union in the non-execution of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who is responsible for non-execution, in which sectors it has occurred and why his Government, the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
Moreover, it must make it clear to the Spaniards what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, which individual and collective energy savings will be obliged to make, what economic consequences will it cause.
That is to say, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has been and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it is a question of sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
To the hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party, he seemed to be so dangerous in his way that he hastened to deny it.
That is to say, it is a question of saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with slogans empty of any real consequence.
With sentences that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman, which is so useful for electoral campaigns that does not speak, that does not denounce and that does not demand, embellishes the meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting party that does not pretend that we are moving by bicycle or refreshing ourselves with the fan.
Mayor and Totana Local Police Chief arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Spanish Gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martinez Andreo, the chief of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and a suspicious hotel entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, today informed the sources of the investigation.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to the Town Hall, where many officers gathered at the moment, who also presented themselves to the Urban Councilrship and to the municipal management company for industrial and housing.
These three stops are in addition to the six stops made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation on the upgrading of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 housing units, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last parliamentary term.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested, but they are charged in the judicial investigation, which is investigated by the Court of First Instance No. 1 in Totana.
The first six detainees have now moved to a judicial provision.
According to the sources, the previous municipal councillor of Totana and currently a general parliamentarian of the PP party, Juan Morales, is the subject of the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was imputed, as was the current fiancée of the former city councillor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur of Vigo (Galici) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigracon (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, an agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the bribes were said to have been made.
The investigation is the responsibility of the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operative Unit (UCO) of the Gendarmerie, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out 11 inspections, the majority in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
As a result, only one person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known poultry business in the region, who may have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the municipality of Murcia, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing units, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which were requalified, and its project would involve doubling the population of the commune, which currently has a population of 25,000.
The Nuaria Group is made up of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with real estate development; Conycase, which manages the car parks of Vigo in the streets of Corua, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Catilico; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides yesterday's commentary in Finland's most important newspaper (as prominent as PISA news above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on 18 November, the same day it looked down there, curiously, the review of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the Philosophy course has caught public opinion as a consequence of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit of the dead, a baccalaureate student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Councillor for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato about what is written in the pages of the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat and stated that studying Nietzsche is not indispensabile in the mandatory basic course of Philosophy in high schools ".

A colleague writes on the introduction in the Criminal Code of offences on Internet downloads:
A. The download of a song would be punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a cd shop with a value of less than EUR 400 is considered only a fault (Article 623.1).
B. Theft in a shop for a value of up to EUR 1 000 is already considered an offence, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and you return it 40 hours later, the sentence is less than the one imposed for downloading (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a sentence of three months to one year (article 154 of the Criminal Code) and trafficking in cds would involve a penalty of six months to two years.
(art. 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the authors'licences is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).

My attending doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research called: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others get less '.
That is to say, the feelings generated by workers' monthly pay depends on what colleagues earn.
The study was carried out using tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group in charge of neurocognition images at the Life-Brain Institute in Germany: 'The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed.'
The researchers observed that when both people guessed that they were receiving the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one of them received twice, the activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Balkan Prosecutor
Carla del Ponte for eight years has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals from the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which is in The Hague.
His term of office ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims are dead - ex-General Ratko Mladic and ex-leader serbobosnio Radovan Karazic are still at large.
Their names are in this list, of which the documentary by the Swiss director Marcel Schapbach takes its title, 'the list of Carla' (2006, not shown exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade in New York who is chasing the fugitive criminals and lobbies the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What insurance is right for me?
Motor insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible claims, involves a large expense which will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, length of life of the driving licence, civil status, type of vehicle to be insured or use, among others.
Having a car is the main one.
There is only, escoger el seguro de autom-vil adecuado es inclusiveo m-s dif-cil que elegir el modelo de veh-culo.
And that's that, choosing the right car insurance, is even harder than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is embodied in an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is based on various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the driving licence, civil status, type of vehicle to be insured or the use that is made, inter alia.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the rating to be paid.
It is for this reason that people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these people have a lower rate of claims due to their prudence.
Similarly, using censuses, companies have concluded that married persons tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and therefore the probability of having an accident.
By increasing the frequency, the probabilities increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when establishing the price of the premium.
For this reason, the driver must study the situation carefully in order to choose the motor insurance that best fits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that insurance, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers it a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face various disadvantages when entering into an insurance contract at an affordable price, such as the low experience in driving and long-term driving licences.
Although the ideal way to be well insured is insurance at risk, other more cost-effective options exist.
The most far-sighted drivers can opt for insurance at risk with deductible, so that they obtain insurance coverage at any risk but at a more accessible price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the claim that the customer pays will be established on the basis of the value of the premium, which will be higher, the lower the amount," says Luis Noguera, Spain's manager of First Europa, online insurance mediator.
Another option is third-party insurance extended, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but by damage caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fire and vehicle loss.
One piece of advice.
If you are a 25-year-old trying to be careful and avoid claims as much as possible, as long as it will affect the bonus, which may reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A subsidy is a reduction in the base rate that the company owns.
On the contrary, a sanction is a mark-up of the basic tariff.
"The bonuses and sanctions will depend on the company and the benefit of the company.
If the company has had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses", Clarifies Noguera.
Beyond the age of 25, it becomes easier for drivers when they place an insurance contract, since the rate of claims is reduced by the experience accumulated.
It is for this reason that it is preferable to choose any risk insurance with a deductible basis.
'Nourle young people cannot benefit from the experience beforehand after an accident,' says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is preferable for him to negotiate insurance at risk, however long his economic situation allows him to do so.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be the persons with the lowest level of claims, because the increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance at any risk with deductible (which may be EUR 300), or third-party insurance extended from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured person has a high level of bonus.
"They have a more relaxed conduct and they have greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of assuming a larger amount of franchises," Luis Noguera said.
For pensioners, insurance at any risk with deductible is preferable (with a maximum of EUR 150), or an extended third-party anity when the insurer has a high level of bonuses.
It must be said that motor insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible disasters, but also because it represents a large expense, which is why it is essential to study properly the insurance that suits us most according to our personal circumstances.
Celtic will seek to win a point in Milan to reach the finals
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow will be measured next Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective objectives in the closure of the Champions League, since it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to rank.
The Italians totaled ten points and they already qualified on the fifth day thanks to a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow had nine points, but he still needed another point to make sure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who had six, and who received Benfica who had four, did not pass him in front.
These two Group D games will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as Milan AC is due to play in the semi-finals of the Club World Cup in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place for the final on 16 December.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the draw at the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium seems to be the most anticipated result, although the two teams will try to get out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it would remain first and ensure a better cross in the finals.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team might be enough to rank if Shakhtar Donetsk did not win, but it would not be able to computer only on this since with nine points the game went to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scots, who are hopeful of finishing for the finals for the second time in the Champions League, after being defeated in the last edition by a goal from Kaka during the overtimes (1–0).
While waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' victory, the triumph would only go to the Shakhtar, in case Celtic lost, to finish for the 16th finals to be able to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that Benfica, although it is last and without the opportunity to continue European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls initiated in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the band disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), ' Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their concert at the GM Stadium Place in Vancouver that the group is "".
Around 20,000 people sold the tickets to the concert that was the subject of a video in which the story of the band that was all the rage at the end of the 1990s was told.
The game and the world tour coincided with the launch of a new album that covered their main successes as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo", which EMI published in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls took to the stage showing the bracelets that the 'Posh Spice' husband had given them, the British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the audience that filled the GM Place, although Victoria had banned him a few days before.
Before the show started, Victoria Beckham remarked that the British footballer "has not seen our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think about the show".
'Sporty Spice' which was part of the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and which caused the group to dissolve two years later, also expressed its nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous but I saw that people's feelings changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," said Chisholm on the group meeting she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also remarked that over time, "things have been arranged and we enjoy ourselves a lot".
But much has changed since the Spice Girls exhibited for the last time in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special plane of Virgin Airlines.
When they arrived at the airport, a babysitter army was waiting for them.
She had five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will show up in California (USA), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5-7 December).
In Madrid they will be exhibited on 23 December.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine is sounding the alarm.
A fierce gas price dispute between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of repercussions on fuel oil exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are transported by pipelines, and each conduit is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev has announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two caused a decrease in supplies to the EU countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, a gas-fuelling Russian monopoly company, tried in vain to reach an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase as planned, its prices to Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said that this would include a 40% increase in the costs of imports from Gazprom for Ukraine.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas passes," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters News Agency.
“Changes in gas costs are likely to be linked to our discussions about transit taxes (towards Western Europe) via Ukraine”
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused the interruption of Gazprom supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, thereby increasing prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Department of Health needs to improve the controls to be carried out on its extra-Community employees to check whether they have previous criminal studies, said the Monitoring Committee.
General Review Auditor's warning, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Department of Health does not have any specific data on the number of overseas people it employs.
Nevertheless, his report highlighted other decisive checks, properly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The Auditor General carried out checks on extra-Community staff following the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28, a doctor of Iraqi origin at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after driving through his jeep in the doors of the main terminal.
He was one of three doctors who were filmed at Old Bailey in October, suspected of involvement in various car explosion attempts in the United Kingdom.
The Department of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas personnel, to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experience and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Department of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out the checks on previous criminal proceedings, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside Britain.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor General's report now states that the committees are required to deal with the Office for the Monitoring of Criminal Prejudicing, thus allowing employers to undertake controls on various countries.
“Although we have discovered that some personnel information has been verified, this is not done every time,” the report says.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Department of Health carries out most of the pre-employment checks it would do itself, but he also added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on some overseas staff is available for health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland, said it is "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment controls could identify employees who might commit future terrorist acts.
He said 'the report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently being carried out, are working well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings could bring any added value.'
The Scottish health authorities reported employing 1,161 overseas personnel, most of whom are doctors and nurses.
But the Auditor-General stressed that these figures certainly need to be increased, partly because of problems relating to the identification of staff with open-ended contracts, who might choose or not, to remain in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current health authority control procedures in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are entirely adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and system of pre-employment controls for non-ociece health service staff.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport. ”
She added that the Scottish Government, allied with the health committees, would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report, which should be published next month, and would commit itself to ensuring better implementation of the recently updated pre-use controls, which were valid for all employees, including the overseas personnel.

Winstone stated that he was proud to receive the award named in honor of star Harris, a protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.

Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it had arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells pinning an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on clergymen and armed forces.
State television of the world's largest oil exporter has stated that one of the missile smugglers' cells.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have staged a campaign against the United States-allied monarchy since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight activists, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in Orientale Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 soldiers to protect the sites, following a failed attack on Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper citing a statement by the Minister of the Interior said that 18 of the arrested persons belonged to a cell run by a “missile launch expert” who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the anti-striking of eight missiles in the kingdom.
Twenty-two of the detainees appear to have plotted the murder of clergymen and armed forces.
The government called on the clergymen to do more against the Saudis in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting the Allied forces and the Shia Muslim government allied with the United States, which is considered heretical along the hard line of the Saudi Sunny.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clergymen have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
Activists, encouraged by calls against the pro-Occidental Saudi Arabian by Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Significant efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five months,” the Minister of the Interior's spokesperson said on state television.
Among the detainees are 16 members of Medina, organized into a “media cell” to promote “Takfiri thought,” the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports the use of violence against infidel and apostat Muslims.
Of the detainees, 32 persons are accused of subsidizing the militants.
Venus' climate could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists yesterday said that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live with.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as Earth, as previously thought.
Venus is the planet closest to Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those of the Earth, and may even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with slower rotation, led Venus to a whole different kind of evolution.
Today the planet is devoid of water, ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms, and has a temperature surface warm enough to melt lead.
The findings of Venus Express, the probe of the European Space Agency, which studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the Earth's potential future due to catastrophic climate changes.
Oxford University's physics department professor Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: 'We're beginning to understand why Venus's climate is so different from Earth's, although the planets themselves are virtually similar.
“Our new data allow us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus was originally identical to Earth, perhaps even with a habitable surface. ”
Enriched uranium is held by the police.
One kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was sequestered by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer stated that three persons had been arrested and the equipment was currently being analysed.
He did not confirm that it was indeed uranium, but revealed that the goods would have a value of 1 million dollars (480,000 dollars).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he was not up to the task manager to answer the questions of a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters had registered their questions, submitted them to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening, 28 November, none of the questions asked was as ridiculous as that of another debate in You Tube, when a snowman asked the Democrats for their position on global warming.
But this time, questions and answers have largely reflected the conditions of the Republican Party, which is a candidate in the upcoming elections.
We don't know what criteria, the CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose the music videos of You Tube to show to the aspirants candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest one-goal of a single theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the main topics for Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to phone when they heard funny things: The board noted increases in approval when candidates spoke rudely.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney is leading the major early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his term as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, of employing illegal immigrants at home.
The two combatants became particularly fierce when asked whether they would be prepared to promote “amnesia” (offering clandestines a regular status and the possibility of becoming citizens).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to further this topic.
None of them has the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, can be due to the fact that they have begun to combat immigration before and in a more incisive way than the others.
In general, candidates, at least on immigration, have the same views: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This issue, combined with the concerns raised in particular by the Chinese-made toxic toys case, or other fears about the outside world, encourage Republicans to forget, or to minimize divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the campaign for weapons control.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether putting water in his nose should be considered torture.
One speaker asked whether the candidates believed in the content of the Bible in its entirety.
This led Mr. Giuliani dared to state that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not sure to believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee was not expected to see Mike Huckabee – in pole position in Iowa in a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism – to declare that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When it was insisted whether Jesus would have been on the sidelines, he started laughing and said that Jesus is too fancy to stand for election.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee in Iowa coincides with recent prodigious grant research by Ron Paul, and whistles during Wednesday's debate.
These two are emerged from the nettle, thanks to the fact that the two party protectors cannot agree to decide who is the better known and more traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party quickly and convincingly thanks to a message of success on American greatness bringing the leaders together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole into which to sink; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, this is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no extra marital finger of foot sucked.
But now there is a revelation that a wealthy businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than 650,000 dollars (about 1.3 million dollars), that the party would not have said: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have done well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister backtracked in his election project, stupidly insulting British intelligence proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped, on the contrary, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, like Vince Cable, the brilliant liberal leader- Liberal Democrat, has said that the terrifying M. Brown changed from Stalin to M. Bean.
The takeover of Northern Rock, a struggling bank on the banks of crack, demonstrated a short line of directives and poor judgement in an emergency.
The inadequate proposals for the change in the tax code have provoked a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from the tax authorities revealed an incredible administrative blunder.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: they proclaimed that being Minister of Defence is part-time for them.
At present, the suspicion of shady donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of Labour (and his former head of vigilance) has had to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown inevitably heads to the exit.
However, Governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and don't trust them, but usually leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he risks suspension: the public administration is no longer functioning; the cabinets of ministers are taking stock; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government becomes defensive and without any more objective.
In a sense, Mr. Brown is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his superior lieutenant.
The Northern Rock and tax data problems, for example, are related to Mr. Brown taken when he was Chancellor of the British Treasure.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair’s misfortunes, like the long investigation into the party’s funds “cash for members of the House of Lords,” voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation facing Mr. Brown is not as tragic as she looks.
The blunders are not so monstrous as members of the Tories party make people believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or frauds.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to turn M.S.'s Stalinist tendencies into reality. Brown always, in favor of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal on political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very particular figure, who compares his donations to charity, has stated that he does not want any public recognition of his benevolence.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of politicians' big subsidizers are clear, and they exist for a good reason: the public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who stated that he was aware of Mr. Abrahams, without knowing that this was illegal, will therefore have to be questioned, as will Jon Mendlesohn, the subsidisant collector who had spoken about dubious donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: There is no evidence that he was aware of these moves, although most of the payments made were made following his arrival in government in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative flaw, but he did not draw attention to the fact that decision-making power is based on something he knows well, using a committee of inquiry on the subject consisting of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been flouted, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things than Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent Public Standards Committee, with no leader for six months, and prepare for good reform on the financial part of the political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, at a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead it to abandon its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for such a supporter. Brown.
But it should confront certain partisan facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the election; it has two years to win back the voters, and the only way to achieve a victory is to demonstrate impeccable integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis in contaminate the US credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see stirringy fins around.
Now that the US real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the US credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that credit card losses could be as high as 99 billion dollars if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of credit to the consumer.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in the rates of costs and insolvency, which measures the balance sheet shares that are not recoverable or are recoverable more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took up a total of EUR 1.4 billion in consumer credit, partly because of the weakness of cardholders.
It is still too early to panic.
Costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% in the fourth quarter is almost one percentage point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the laws in the United States in 2005 concerning personal bankruptcy caused an abrupt fall in the bankruptcy archives, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the monthly amount of debt that consumers have to pay.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the emission volume for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
Direct infection links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers may prefer to increase their debt now that fair mortgages have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of cash than to the value of wealth, and so the fall in house prices has not necessarily led to a change in borrowers’ credibility.
They could even bring benefits to credit issuers.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if properties cost less than the value of the loan; therefore, credit card indebtedness would become a priority to repay the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much more quickly than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter prediction limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid recovery in action.
“We’re not going to wake up one morning and re-evaluate all the loans,” said Gary Perlin, the director of Capital One.
If a financial catastrophe of the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a significant decline.
If lower house prices and a contraction in the credit market lead America into recession, industry will certainly face a gruesome future.
Pay close attention to the dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who had to testify their roles in relation to fraud committed by Enron's previous chief financial officer, Mr. Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had first declared themselves innocent of seven charges of alleged collusive fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam in order to enrich themselves with the damage of their employees.
They are expected to report to the court in January.
But during a hearing presided over by American judge Ewing Werlein Jr., they all found themselves guilty of committing fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, have become famous throughout the UK because of the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains an outstanding issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges imposed on them in 2002 made Fastow aware that it was the subject of the government's investigation into the Enron debacle.
The charges against the bankers, nicknamed the "three of Natwest" claimed to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his ex-right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, who helped him rule bankruptcy procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had considered its interest in the subsidiary to be nil, but in fact the three UKs already knew its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest of the bank of the subsidiary for EUR 1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper 250,000 dollars as an interest in this company.
According to the accused, Fastow falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was entitled to pay Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But the truth is that 20 million dollars have gone into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers were awarded the USD 7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others are estimated to have earned USD 12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow suffered a six-year incarceration in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcerated for three years and one month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British people were released as a result of a bond of EUR 1 million each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh largest national company, bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even offer its bogus speculation as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of layoffs, more than 60 billion loss of market value and more than 2 billion losses for pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former general president Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years'imprisonment.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were in vain because of his death from a heart attack last year.
Neither under, nor outside Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine with sufficient fuel life to fly without a stopover from Moscow to Los Angeles, is worth 54 million dollars.
But this is just a small change for some Russians.
“It can carry up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Even if no one really needs so many seats, since it is more of a family-use aircraft or for the president of a company."
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaires's Salon, an ogy of anti-consumer, for four days, which is being held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of the new Russian rich in their varied products, ranging from mahogany yachts to diamond-filled cars like 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was voting on a brilliant orange Porsche, displayed next to his stand.
"It's a nice car, but nothing like our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
“Thanks to an oil boom, Russia’s capital seems to be rolling in black gold, such as Dallas.”
"We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar from the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerged as the world's largest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry enabled Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on the strategy for selling luxury goods to markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
Moreover, two-thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires, who are worth 670 billion overall, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists at the center of economic and financial research.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that's why we are all here,” said Nicole Marais, a representative of London’s Davis Morris.
She participated in the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor, Soho Jewellery Group.
“Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Walking through the salon on Sunday evening, the two real estate agents beat on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 say they are like their clients, millionaires.
"I looked at cars and tried to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Melle Yumatova, who grabbed her high-fashion dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The lounge seems to aim above all for the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to queue in the traffic jams to come to a huge warehouse where Cadillac Escalades, platinum cantage, Movenpick ice creams, custom pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears are displayed.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros (EUR 44.57).
“Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands,” said Mr. Gijrath, sitting proudly at the Royal Dutch Porcelain Delf factory stand, in front of a wall painting of darkening on blue tiles, made of hand.
"it is certain that the Russians are more interested in bling bling"
Indeed, the sellers have stated here that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years are too much according to Russian standards) have already moved from bright logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not be sold at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, either millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, survey the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
On the first night of the exhibition last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of the King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and cotton inlaid with gold threads.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales manager of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also claimed to have sold to a Russian millionaire, the brilliant orange Porsche, for a total of 170,000 dollars.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, President of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said it would sell three brace-like cars, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, for 55,000 dollars each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be embedded in Swarovski crystals to look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs 22,000 euros.
“The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires,” said Mr. Karapetian.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles.”
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the term “Russian millionaire” is not on the agenda, given the rise in house prices here.
"If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There's more you might think"
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian heritage management company.
The company set up four stands representing the British telephone booths, filled with a mass of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said that his team printed 500,000 counterfeit notes for the Millionaire salon.
Passers-by arrested to throw masses of tickets, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or pocketing a few million.
“You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel a millionaire,” said Mr. Karyev.
Unlicated homicide surgeon in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston was watching Just a Little Healthier's glass window and watching an ambulance that had just stopped at the gates of the White Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
and then another.
“Then I saw the medical vehicle stop.” Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, said on Wednesday.
That's when I realized that someone had died.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, which the police have not yet identified, reside at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Miss Arroyo's death, but they are confident about the results of the toxicological tests which, unfortunately, will take time, but which should make it possible to resolve this mysterious death which saddened the high ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo was the assistant of the director of the police, Garry F. McCartthy, since September 2006, and his voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious.” McCarthy said about Miss Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday. ”
"she was like a pit bull."
"she would have done everything to protect me"
Mr. McCarthy stated that Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcohol Drinks Control Commission, and that she left two 14- and 11-year-old sons and a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokesman for the Union County Public Prosecutor's Office, Theodore J. Romankow, stated that the detectives were trying to determine whether Melle Arroyo died because of unauthorized surgery.
“This is a possibility to consider. ”
“the investigation is continuing. ”
The authorities stated that they had arrived at her home at around 3 p.m.
and found Miss arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little over a week has passed since then, and the authorities have said little about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh could not confirm whether Ms Castro had been questioned by the authorities.
Investigators seek to understand whether part of the house was being used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Melle Castro's house where a faded rose rests in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barked in the back.
A blue can called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung on the sides.
McCarthy stated that since arriving in Newark 25 years ago, at the New York Police Department, Miss Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her supervised political culture.
"She said, 'you have to pay attention to this,'" he said.
"she was there when I arrived, and still there when I was leaving."
"It was embarrassing."
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will lower the rates of the booming global stock exchange.
Shares were blown up on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm credit conditions, later reducing interest rates promoted by the soothing statements of the US Central Bank’s vice president.
Stock markets are booming in London, New York, and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, said that those who decide must be “flexible and pragmatic” in their actions in turbulent financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure irritable markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said the recent turbulence has partly reversed some improvements in the functioning of the market at the end of September and October.
Should this harsh turbulence persist, it would increase the likelihood of a later rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into US markets, and that further interest-rate cuts could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped calm Wall Street with even worse news about the US economy, such as the largest drop in real estate sales for October.
The repercussions of this financial tumult were accentuated following the statement of Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it would divest 650 people, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to offset the heavy losses due to the losing bets on mortgages.
Only 20 posts are planned in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 percentage points, or 2.55%, concluding at 13,289.40, while the largest index, S-P 500, rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points or 2.7%, concluding at 6306.2 adding more than 39 degrees to the value of UK companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 rose 2.3%.
Previously, the resurgence of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted following the strong demand for an auction of monthly sorting funds from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a heavy rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to monitor the Fed and the EBC and inject further funds into London’s financial markets, causing credit tensions, have resulted in UK banks’ monthly “Liber” sorting rates causing their highest growth since September, to 6.59% following a strong recovery since November 12.
England faced an appeal against criticism of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We face two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the No. 6 drummer for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will take the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the coaches who was there exceptionally to help coach Peter Moores, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the President of England's CEO, begins to fill out the application forms to become a national coach, at least part time.
Anyone who fails to win bib 6 will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sport is also unfair.
It is never easy to annihilate what allows one man to reach the top of his profession while another never reaches the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than lack of skill.
It is not only cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, the judgement remains subjective.
Is the right time to bring Bopara out?
Is it right in relation to Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which chooses between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both new executives with good degrees, professionals should be promoted: but there is only one place for them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless he is given at least one chance?
The figures are important in decisions, but also opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the one-day cricketer.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in great shape and continued to train himself to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors out of 33 laps to earn a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on average, but they have already lived their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer again.
If it's Shah or Bopara who will play at the Asgiriya Stadium, it's just a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well in the first, with five doors and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the primary cricketer of the Test, and this, despite the fact that his double cent scored against Australia in Australia could still be underestimated.
The likelihood predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at the Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of the young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In Shah's strong and considerable innings of the 88 Test in Mumbai, 32 cents first-class compared to six for Bopara, who was 22 years old, was seven years younger, and his excellent launch ranking.
But Shah made only ten rounds during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test at Lord, his middle-playing town, and that, the immediate rejection by the coaches when Vaughan again in good shape, demanded his place for the next match, seems to have saddened his obvious moose in Mumbai.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy in life.
Nothing frightened him on a cricketfield and he exaggerated when he recently got captivated on a 4x4 during a presentation by Volkswagen, England's sponsor.
He only reported slight injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at him from afar, to ask him "has had seen this?" ”
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his shooting gait allows him to do the services that he goes hand over, and that he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right moment is another.
Maybe this is the real art of selection?
I would be willing to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he will play this weekend.
Buses bring people back to work, and fight against al Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, dumping these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others hoping that the city regained normality.
Some have returned to fight against the militants who have taken them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus 800 people in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdas,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a doctor Sunni.
“I came back today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now. ”
“They say that the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes,” he said, referring to the Shia militia of ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who has forced his men to move away for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Suni-dominated Amariyah area, returned with his two children, as he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and the regime prevented Iraqis from working.
His neighbors in Shia in Amariyah called him to inform him that the militia helped by the United States, drove Al Qaeda out of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of Jordan's new arrivals is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his house north of Baghdâd because of a grenade attack after he incited citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
“two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they set up an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys. ”
“That’s why I’m coming home today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have attracted the growing lull in the capital since American troops arrived, and at the continuous formation of well-armed "groups of involved citizens" collaborating with the American military to defend their neighborhood.
But still others say they were forced to return because of the visa problem and the decline of the Damascus capital, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, the father of three, expressed everyone's suspicion about the exiled visas that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, allegedly asked the Syrian government to limit to force people back home.
More than two and a half million people are said to have fled the country because of the sectarian squadrons of death.
“we had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to give Iraqis no more visas, forcing them to return to Iraq,” said the Retired Sunni.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left.”
The decline in violence may be explained in part by the fact that the Sunnis were driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where there is less tension.
There are fears that a sudden flow of refugees will increase sectarian tensions and bring back the fighting.
Little Saarland, good training.
The smallest federated State conducts professional training, and even shines with the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the sarries, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I lied yesterday for the 50th time to a non-sarreat, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest state, by self-mockery, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the Saarland training system, which is ranked fifth in the training monitor of the German Economics Institute in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Saarbruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have had the opportunity to complete their studies there with a double or even a triple degree.
This is reflected in the status of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Saarland also takes the country's children to higher-than-average schools - many of them without a Gymnasium degree.
'In Saarland, we take advantage of the system of vocational training,' says IW, a training expert at IW.
More than one in five young people obtained their title to a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
Thus, the possibilities of combining vocational and academic training are relatively well developed.
Given the number of inhabitants, the double-curriculum panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by one third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education in Saarland has forced higher schools to a marketing campaign in engineering science subjects.
'After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools,' said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced comparison tests throughout the federated state.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of fish is free of rights - a model that in the meantime other federated states also copy.
Only future comparison studies can show whether students'performance improves in a sustainable way.
In PISA studies in 2003, the number of students at risk decreased from 29 per cent to 20 per cent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not improve as much as other states.
The Bavarians are doing better.
And in the great spite of the saroli, knowledge of foreign languages is not measured by the PISA studies - otherwise one could gain points in this area.
Because the neighbor's language is compulsory in high schools - even if the sarolia are not French.
Chavez sets watches
In Venezuela, watches will soon be ticking in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will set the timer back half an hour in the South American country.
Chavez meanwhile becomes a cartoon in Spain.
As the official journal of Venezuela communicated it, by virtue of a new law, the watches will be paid at less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Chavez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chavez announced on Wednesday (local time) that relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, had stopped a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe would remain President of Colombia, he would have relations with neither the head of state nor with the Colombian government.
'I can't do it, already because of my dignity,' said Chavez, who hastened a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw from Chavez the mandate of negotiations on the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe reportedly "cracked in the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Chavez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, Chavez is in every mouth.
A new mobile phone ringtone is all the rage in the country: "Of the price of being downloaded on the Internet" (why don't you get around) is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded from the Internet.
It was pronounced by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was upset by the constant arrests of left-wing populists and told him to remain silent.
A fall in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the high economic situation, according to a prognosis, a real wage capital loss threatens German workers this year.
Experts cited all sorts of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Buckler Foundation, employees should expect a real decrease in their pay slip in 2007 compared to the previous year.
'Fail lies in the low wage development, the increase in the Value Added Tax and rising food and energy prices,' said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Business Research in the journal 'Bild'.
New charges could also arise in the area of unemployment insurance for the employee.
The Finance Minister Peer Steinbruck told the newspaper "Neue Osnabr-cker 'eitung" that the projected drop in unemployment insurance by 3.3% for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency is no longer allowed to be embarrassed to apply to the Federation for credits or financial aid, in the words of the SPD politician.
It was known on Tuesday that the explosion in food and hydrocarbon prices had pushed inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices rose by 3.0 per cent year-on-year.
Venus is the earth's infernal twin.
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus looks more like Earth than previously believed: the European space probe 'Venus Express' has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and wind eddies at the poles, as similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have been assuming that there are flashes of Venus.
The European 'Venus Express' probe has today proved this - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: the flashes on Venus burst at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud cloud, says Christopher Russell from the University of California to Los Angeles in the scientific magazine 'Nature'.
According to the famous theory of cyprine, lightning revealed life on Earth: the storm stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If there has been life, it must have been on a very ancient date in history," says Sean Solomon of the Carbonist Institution in Washington.
There should be little living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the Earth's infernal twin, but she remains a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which looks so much like the Earth in mass and dimensions, was struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ESA mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venusian research, as no more probes had been on the way to explore this planet since the 1990s.
In the view of the researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several articles in "Nature" do not only highlight the singularity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the commonalities with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more numerous than at first glance.
For example, in addition to the vortices of wind already known at the north pole, found a vortex of clouds at the south pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of draughts in the Earth's hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The so-called evening or morning star germinated revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much more slowly on itself: a Venusian day lasts 243 days of land.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly recalls the Earth, scientists assume that the two planets formed under similar conditions.
Of both, water accumulated and remained on Earth as oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has bonded to Earth as carbonate, it forms most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Kohler defended Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Kohler, demands an end to the dispute between the parties over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs for attacks on the chancellor after the September match.
Federal President Horst Kohler was concerned about the appearance of Germany and summed up the grand coalition to end the quarrel over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
'We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue,' Kohler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he showed understanding for the Dalai Lama's reception by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
'Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for differences between cultures,' said Kohler.
It is well known that Germany should maintain a sensitive foreign policy balance, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the reproaches that she would organize a new policy of China.
The German Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
"China also knows," said Kohler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked outside the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained in particular about the CDU's "tailor-policy" in the field of foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama was greeted at the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese reports.
For example, the Chinese Government not only rejected German Finance Minister Peer Steinbruck (SPD), but according to information from Spiegel, also froze the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
China’s head of government, Wen Jiabao, now demands German Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that hosting the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refused to allow European politicians to receive Tibet's spiritual leader in his official duties, supported Wen Jiabao and China's position.
The words and deeds of the Dalai Lama would show that he was trying to separate Tibetan Tibet from China and other Tibetan areas, which also included other current provinces.
Schauble warns against riots like those of France.
Street fights with police, shooting, burning cars: Wolfgang Schauble warns against riots like those of France.
Every effort must be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not burst into the streets by violence, the German Minister of the Interior demanded.
Burning barricades, thugs firing at the police with hunting rifles: after the severe youth riots in France, the German Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schauble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not also contain itself in our country and defuses itself into violence.
We must take this seriously," he said at Hanover's "Neue Presse".
Not all young people would be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federated states and the municipalities were already working firmly to reduce the problems, said Schauble.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, this is already showing its first successes."
However, it would be too early for an end to the alert.
At the same time, Schauble points out that in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems or from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the Parisian towns of the north, young people had fought serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings burned down.
Greater integration efforts by the German Government are demanding by the President of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as volatile as in France.
However, there would still be a need for action.
Kolat stresses that the quota for unemployed among young people under 25 years of age with a migrant background would be above the average.
Above all, more training places should be provided.
Kolat insisted: 'We must give young people a perspective'.
The President of the Turkish Communities added, however, that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Moreover, many young people with an immigrant background do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged, "But we still have to be careful."
"It is necessary to give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very calm during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter flew over the area with headlamps.
The current authorities reported on three arrests as well as a few cars and garbage cans burned.
Since the conference, a deployment of approximately 1,000 security forces ensures calm.
The police will intervene for as long as necessary, announced Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 policemen were injured during the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the disturbances were overflowing in Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the death of the young people.
In Angela Merkel's empire.
The utopian scene of the Chancellor shows that the coalition is done with the bottom - and there is nothing left to expect from it.
In which country exactly does this Chancellor live?
After his distressing speech in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, we must say: not here - not in the country which should, in the end, be governed by it.
The criticism of focusing too much on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel with a harsh and presumptuous phrase.
It is provincial, she said and has only shown that she does not want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it made it visible to all how accurate this reproach was.
There were neither concrete or feelings about the country's problems".
Instead, Angela presented herself like a cloud: a weightless politician, who flees in foreign policy and even there remains in the near future.
For example, climate protection: in this area, it welcomes the Heiligendam agreements again and again, but does not say how the climate objectives will have to be achieved in our country.
Even, self-praising - to have so little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it just two years ago.
Now it clings to ready-made formulas, which growth would affect people.
By this it destroys its image as a pragmatist, which solves problems instead of beautifying the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic politics problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
He still has a few propagnant sentences for this.
In this area, it is indicative of the number of times when it is a matter of family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to say a half-spoke in mind.
It stitches in uncharted territory, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack branch
In the Youtube debate of Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle – and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already breaking out on the first subject.
He is said to have made New York a "refuge for the illegal immigrants", reproached Mitt Romney for his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
"I would say his own house as a haven for illegal immigrants," said Giuliani and blamed the former governor of Massachusetts for using undocumented immigrants.
Candidates mount the attack: as the Republican base has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use CNN debates first to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users have sent through YouTube are barely more than blowers.
"It was with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power," said John McCain to his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also being lectured vigorously by Vietnam's veterans, when he refuses to condemn the so-called "Waterboarding" as torture, a method of interrogation where drowning is being abused.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign are going beyond the war in Iraq and debates on torture can be seen in the reactions of the Common Room of St. John's. Petersburg in Florida.
Whether conservative values are praised or future tax increases are denied, applause sweeps into the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favourites lie once again.
"I made a mistake at that time," Romney explains, and apologizes to the grass-roots and television audience for still being a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, passes into a noose when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf ruled for the first time in civilian clothes.
A day after his withdrawal as head of the arm, Pakistani man of power Musharraf was invested as president.
Eight years of domination by the army ended.
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf has vowed to abide by the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he passed on his office as head of the arm to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bend to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after taking power by a bloodless coup, the former general now ruled for the first time as head of civil status.
By this withdrawal from the post of Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on 3 November.
Already shortly after his inauguration Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfill another demand of the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of a state of emergency with lawyers in its ranks, had last week rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on one military convoy and four others were injured.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on a street near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of Krautrock are back.
Germany's supergroups of the 1970s replayed: the three members of the Harmonia group took their console again in a concert in Berlin.
For their return, recordings of their great success "Live 1974" were published.
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening poster.
Each has its own small box in front of it, its cable and, above all, its buttons.
Dieter Moebius, at the age of 63, throne in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
He is flanked on the left of a 57-year-old Michael Rother and in possession of a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, curved on his console.
Each contributes to noise, among other things, a Beat.
And sometimes it's inadvertently added to a piece of traditional music.
Moreover, this does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves too much.
The fact that the Harmonia band played again ensured some emotion among Krautrock enthusiasts.
We have the right to unveil here: targeted polls reveal that, admittedly, the name is reasoning in the collective memory of pop, but in no way as sustainable in order for this group to lack so painfully for 32 years.
But why would German not also have the right to celebrate its living legends of the 1970s?
All the more so since what is misleadingly called "Krautrock" has always enjoyed more and more in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, the interrogation German pop faces were seen in the room.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Dusseldorf and Nuz in the panegyric praise, astonishment was no longer limited.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped to the Red Hot Chili Peppers stage as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in the unknown is the one and only.
The memory is therefore already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed for only two years and that during this period, the impactivity that felt was much weaker than what was attributed to it subsequently by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We played first in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then, for a church-subsidised label, for financial reasons, in Dusseldorf.
Rother had briefly troubleshooted in Kraftwerk and eventually made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neua, who was at the time perhaps the most radical German band.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster musicians in exile in the Weserbergland forest.
There, in an ancient Weser farm, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Kommune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the manner of Spitzweg.
So-called was in the trash can a pennant of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many held Harmonia away from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next "De Luxe".
Because as serene and modest as the music sounded, the band suffered from material misery.
The harvesting of dead wood alone was not used in search of self-seeking.
The recently released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of nearly 50 heads, as well as someone thinks they are remembered.
Rother issued at that time the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother lands in the spheres of esotericism and ensured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster reanomated in the 1980s and has been more successful than yet another.
We're doing Griessem's Live album to Herbert Grenemeyer.
His Granland label set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as a German contribution inherent in contemporary music.
It had already been excavated on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia took place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly funded as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire fluctuation band of the Krautrock's influence would be identified with respect to future pop music.
The room left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's phrase hangs in the room in the middle of the singular sounds: "The only true music you listen to the future."
There are photos that show the producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
Spending other black and white photos of bazaar-wired tools are used to form the legend.
In front of them, the three veterans are once again improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and the battery, to pull out unheard-of sounds with the instruments built by the self-made effects instruments.
Today, electronic music resembles electronic music.
The three in large technical fignoeurs.
Even the house choir will not change anything.
Under Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and sing at a nice moment "Aaaaaaah" with accentuatedness.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It's never happened to rock.
Roots have been searched less in the blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the flight of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
He who shouts "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia is not yet irritated by this now.
But what goes most out of light will be meticulously covered on the stage.
Where does the music begin and where does it end?
It can beat someone's nerves (?) or give fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Milenty," two films revolve the Balkan War.
But both do not convince.
Either the projects are too much based on action and on the exchange of senseless shots or, on the contrary, they are too watery.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first of all: certainly the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is precisely here, in the most gloomy hinterland of the Bosnian war, that the actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had ultimately lost sight of the most handsome man of the 1980s, because far too many nice roles and belly in women's sentimental films and far too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism delighted him to feel like showing up.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch "The Hunting Party" anyway - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why should today's films be as long and confusing as collective agreements of locomotive drivers?)
He delivers a magnificent picture of the winks: in the background, his war reporter character Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if fate and the film industry were not as benevolent: a man who has his best moments behind him for a long time, but who, even as a monument in ruins in his decline, has nevertheless kept visible remains of his old charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Mosele', which is also coming out this week, the endless sequel to the Balkan war.
From 'leathous peace', the trial can be carried out quickly: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian of Kosovo snipers, in which one of the two still falls in love.
While it is welcome that here the Serbs are not once presented as the only causes of all the evils, this film as flat as a TV movie is lost far too quickly in action and exchanges of senseless fire.
This remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, one can look at the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why basically there has never been a real good film about the Balkan War.
The story of the three American war reporters, who are conditioning themselves to track the high war criminal "the fox", might have become, along with another director and another screenwriter (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because stories are strikingly similar: two males go in small teams in the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do and for both males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for The Hunting Party's failure is that you just don't let Simon Hunt be the deserted heart cynic, as it's presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute to him a romantic adventure with a Bosnian woman murdered later.
Then 'The Hunting Party' becomes definitively bad, when the reporter, in the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, manages that NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have failed in five years: to catch the war criminal and leave him for a just revenge to the Bosnian Muslims.
It is so bad that the International Court of The Hague should be brought before a crime against film logic.
In this case, the film has too profound a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must exceptionally agree) not to drive the hunt quite intensively because of secret political agreements.
But the well-meaning and the villain this time are so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to us at the idea.
The one speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compassionate, I see the swollen veins of the forehead, clearly: how tired it is to be mean."
Films like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but insinuate how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films about the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been a good film about South Africa before.
This applies to each time: when a star drags on a crisis hotspot or on a minefield, there is then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits to go Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
Anyway, decades were always passed before Hollywood could make a good movie about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List."
Some films still have to mature - those that are now worth classic works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were in no way celebrated unanimously in their time as masterpieces.
But maybe we know today just too much about the conflicts of the world, where every bloodshed arrives live on two screens at the same time at home.
And that thrilled the writers for the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The dictator" actually became as good as well because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good flims.
Perhaps we should have the sarcastic and remote artistic gaze from the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel 'Dictionary of Lemprière' and the Balkan War, he replied: 'It only goes to the fact that some things never change'.
"The big cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be murdered in a horrifying way and war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust received criticism for the cancellation of the Olympiad.
The mayor's retreat from the Hamburg candidacy for the Summer Olympics came to a stark political and economic situation.
Many want to continue fighting for the Waterfront Games.
But Von Beust calls for realism in assessing opportunities.
The senior director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jorg Schmidt-Trenz, described a abandonment on Wednesday as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had deployed as many motivating forces in the city as the idea of the Olympiads.
"Without this objective, the political and sporting momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures".
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find it a new longer-term starting point, "taking another modified agenda as its starting point".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday on his previous statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until the year 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on a candidate for the Olympic Games, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the expected decision of the Sports Federation in early December, referring to Munich's application for the 2018 winter games.
This preference means to us that, in the time we had planned until 2028 until then, we will have no chance."
However, the dream does not belong definitively to the past, said Von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
The impression would be given that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity, burying the plans already now," said the HSB President Guner Ploi on Wednesday.
A drop in the candidacy would further be in contradiction with the statements made by the head of the Senate on the occasion of the reception in full-class meeting of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust would have qualified Hamburg's bid for the 2015 Universiades as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Sports Schools had first in the past weeks nominated Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD faction of the mayor criticized the Senate for not using this precious time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of Little Grasbrook was rejected by the Senate for years because he played the Olympiad map and ruled out housing construction," SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD has always called for a plan for the Little Grasbrook to be integrated into the Olympiads and a later use of the housing, the CDU would have relied exclusively on the "Event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics would have been a great deal of enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg had, however, shattered itself against Leipzig.
These are not Warhols' boxes.
The one that connects the Swedish concepts and a wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or so?
At the moment, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol's list of works.
Many of the ninety Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counter-facies.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned a few months ago the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes, the internal research of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm today leads to a disenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Hulten Museum gave a gift in 1995 to the Moderna Museet,which circulate on the international art market.
The ancient history is entangled, a disconcerting sequence of artistic and curatorical productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York's first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of "Brillo" powder soap cartons.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet featured in 1968 - with the Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: Warhol did not come (for financial reasons) but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models, exposure samples.
At the same time, Warhol had made it clear in 1968 that a few Brillo wooden boxes would be produced in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time today speak of about fifteen wooden boxes which at the time would have entered law into the history of art and auctions, as original Brillo-Boxes of authorized Andy Wahrol, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them reached more than USD 100,000 in auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum mistakenly claimed that about 100 wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would later have given over to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 coffers were produced in Malmo in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol had already died for three years.
Lars Bystrom, the chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, next to the museum's six Brillo-Boxes, three more of Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and sanded, then a white oil paint brush was applied.
The texture of the copies dating from 1990 reveals, on the contrary, that the paint was applied directly without a background layer to the laminated panels, using a roll of paint - moreover, it is not an oil paint, but an acrylic.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes", let the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve, hear: 'If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come yet another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection.
Already in July the Authentication Board has, of course, announced that it would investigate the "heavy charges" that will be raised in the case of boxes of powder soap.
But since we have been with an inseparable silence there.
Manila's Rebel Soldiers Abandoned
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers were abandoning, the same ones who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the President for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not be held accountable for any bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to power had recently stormed the hotel with lacrimogenic gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been entrenched in the building for hours.
About half of them were standing in court on Wednesday because of an attempted coup failed in 2003 - including Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly eclipse with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who were normally to monitor them, had apparently deserted in his favour and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Troops loyal to power sealed the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers'action.
"People have had enough," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who pre-commanded the elite unit of the Rangers Scouts, stated that other army units would soon join the march.
Critics of the regime called for a major demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His Government had been surrounded by corruption reproaches for months.
Manila's finance district had already been the scene of the attempted mutiny of about 200 army members against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurgency broke nearly 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986 there have already been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet became a main shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet secured more than 20 per cent of the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is EUR 14.46, as communicated by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of the share capital would be held.
We had already speculated on a buyout before.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
This step is seeking to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet reported.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the network operator in Dusseldorf from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would hold the money only for a third part, it says on the market.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a nearly 10 percent stake in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares on the stock exchange worth EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet purchased EUR 5.15 million for EUR 31.1 million.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL and mobile telephony products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," said a spokesperson for United Internet.
Both companies founded the MSP shareholding company to absorb the competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to feel satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not to make use of their extra 18.49 percent freestyle, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies would allow themselves all the options open, especially to increase participation in the SA Freenet, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
The poor poker on Freenet that has been going on for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
By the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers linked by a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
The holding of United Internet and Drillisch had a direct stake in Freenet of 6.01 per cent.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will bring about an additional four percent.
The right to purchase 18.49 per cent of the investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
