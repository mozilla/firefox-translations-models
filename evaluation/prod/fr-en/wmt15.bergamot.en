UKIP’s whistleblowers who deny those living with HIV are a prime example.
You talk about when Nigel Farage says that the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the UK to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he replies yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the undesirables.
First you use specious arguments, then you discredit them with a thinly veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to line up behind chronic hypochondria intolerant who think all is due to them.
I think you're using specious arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by right-wing nuts, exists virtually no.
I believe that this is what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP's anti-health tourism measures, so there is no problem.
Only in the UKIP parallel universe Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quotation from a cloth does not constitute evidence.
Yes, then shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, but he only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for propagating such populist propaganda as if that were the reality.
I don't think you know what a specious argument is.
You also know nothing about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when trying to kill the debate with accusations of homophobia.
Farage's phrase came as a lot of surprise, but only because we so rarely talk about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remark.
You're going to have to get over it.
I'm not, of course, where you want to go from, but I guess you don't like it when the media talks about what you don't like.
It is so rarely talked about because, unlike Farage and his crazy Thatcher disciples who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are good, then no.
Eventually, the situation is also rotten in Ireland as in Spain.
With the new crisis coming the period of austerity will have not helped.
Hope for almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland's 'TIGRE OF EUROPE' was bragging to us a few years ago.
We've seen what happens next.
This again should read the article.
There is an attempt to make people believe that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a 'new 'new MONTHly' is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, impots on the lowest companies in Europe, a very flexible working march, a continuous emigration market.
With these ingredients not what 'ponize' at the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 1980s of the twenty-first century, the irthrant was one of the poorest countries of the European Union, with Portugal. Considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
The Greek was in front.
That their development was not a long quiet river, it is on the lookouts of recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That is not true.
Latvia has a tax rate of 0% on companies.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on the impots that are really paid by the multinationals.
According to a report released in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in general in France.
Only SMEs pay full jar.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become a great new, and there are new (and expensive) cars have all the street corners, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery has been evident in the daily traffic jams since the start of the school year.
Is it supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon be on the blazing.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a hanging on the A140.
Does Ryanair now intend to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of aircraft, so a few bumps and stripes on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said, I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of those two once they're getting back on track.
So it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair charge a supplement to the passengers for the additional fear that they were kind enough to give them?
But without these kinds of Irish companies, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I've never taken Ryanair and the last three times I flew it was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can enjoy it.
Any article about Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair to those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay something other than the base rate just have to blame themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair is not going to be satisfied with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays are going to be and whether it will be going to compensate passengers and, if so, if Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an error on the part of the airport air traffic controllers.
The passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour and are not entitled to any compensation.
Sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome on this British Airways flight, which takes English-ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally teeming with people.
People do not come en masse for the quality of restaurants (some, for the most part) or for the Salon de la revue à l'Espace des Blancs-Matsaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With many foreigners spending .....
Do you think the opening of Sunday is going to create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sunday, full of people with 50% tourists.
zolaes, false.
The only argument that would seem acceptable to me is that of areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and is qualified by the fact that they buy tax exemptions.
Tourist areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons.
There remains industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, makes it possible to lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right which, with exceptions, benefits from employees.
That is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister for Economic Affairs nor the Minister responsible for foreign affairs has the least competence to reform the Labour Code.
So they lock it up.
What is the point of law?
To satisfy a part of the population and companies wishing to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday apm I take my grandchildren to the municipal library.
In my city of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal biblioe is open 4 days a week but not the we.
This is access to culture ...
And that's also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he tenaciously defended against fascism
the way of life he defended tenaciously against fascism and Bolshevism
What if her daughter's estate was, against her will, used to pay the inheritance costs?
There are paintings.
Some are good, others are not terrible.
No doubt his succession would want his share of the cake, if you pass the expression to me.
his preference for a victory for nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and its fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
Neither do I.
But for five years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 He stood up to the other aristos of the government who wanted to discuss an "agreement" with the Nazis and he very skilfully won.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting against fascists was the only way to win.
The people of the United Kingdom, and France, and Belgium and, ultimately, the entire world, can thank God for having had during these five years, just five years, Churchill at the helm and no other.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
Whether his descendants sell the paints on the free market to raise the money from the inheritance costs, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them collect the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was "the moment of truth," Churchill's personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A relaunch of the internal market through public works will only favour large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, with infrastructure projects by definition being unrenewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister, they reflect the real frankness: distrust of dialogue
Back to the princeps values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
Let the weakest of us not be in need.
Either in solidarity we come to his aid, or he has RIGHT in exchange for the services he renders or has returned to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the lessor who lives from income from his properties.
A distinction should be made between those who invest in return at the time of retirement and those who live from their pensions.
One good to rent or even two for a couple above is vice
The little genius of finance is singularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great works, but at a time of scarcity in large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, so in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decay is emerging in response to a recession that is only a sudden and therefore a sudden decline.
You would have been right 30 years ago: no need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, motorways, etc.
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investment is screaming: insulation, renovation of the rail network, urban transport, transport and energy storage, etc.
Taxes that favour high incomes and rentiers.
Who is in power?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallop.
Samsung's profits are undermined by the iPhone 6 and its competitors in the same range
AppleTM's introduction of larger screens for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who otherwise would have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided on the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not to Apple.
I believe that it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft implemented this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be met by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I like design.
Some people don't value design, for them options, functionality, and price take precedence.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for a "better platform."
Is there a "best car manufacturer," not really, they're different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving portable industry, with radically different approaches to different people and markets.
It is healthier and must be encouraged.
That is our common interest.
I'm glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it's not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our umply-frontist friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, on Parisian bobos) could tell us which author(s) they are fighting ideas about gender and tell us what books they intend to combat.
Or do they just attack the kind as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric 'emmour?
Okay, Jean, I like you, and you're an intelligent and cultured person.
I said that about Judith in Furusato's vein evoking Holofernes, a rapprochement that hadn't come to me (I don't have her vivacity of mind).
Otherwise, in the "fund," since you refer to it, I'm not interested in this subject, and honestly I don't see where the problem is: I was hoping that you and your friends could get me out of my backwardness, because I'm slow but I understand correctly...
Jean: Recognize that, culturally, send Judith back to Holoferne, it does.
Who is afraid is asking the world?
But what do we fear those who are afraid of?
Furasato and - give us some answers.
The first invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat slicer.
We see how intimate these studies are at home.
Of course, we are no longer in the debate on the idea.
It's something else, much deeper.
Have you read, John, that Le Monde published an article on the need for theology?
I thought I should go to the sources.
Pretending to fight ideas from the only explanation that their detractors make of them (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem very rigorous to me.
But hey, as I explained to our frontist friend, that's the difference between having an enlightened opinion and a simple opinion.
I am not sure that the nuance is understood.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic throat slicer, I contented myself with the "Second Sex" (it was more of my time) which I believe is the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I was looking at the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed up when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and somewhat compensated for the disappointment of sometimes having the view blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, the cloud of last night was really clamping the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Special blood moon flash.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey makes the Labor responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will return its true colour to it as soon as possible.
You're obsessed with that?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I only saw clouds.
Melbourne also managed to cover itself throughout the week of the Perseid meteor shower and for virtually all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm beginning to think that there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are improving a lot on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I couldn't see the eclipse because of the clouds over the suburbs of Melbourne.
I'm going to put a TAX on this eclipse.
WHO CONCARDS watching this eclipse should pay a TAX.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess you when he (obtainably) disappear?
It seems you spend a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people criticize about the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed with them.
Beautiful picture of the moon over Sydney's Harbour Bridge.
It looks like Mars is going to collide with the Earth.
Nothing about stock market and real estate speculation.
Nothing about the inequalities between income from work and capital.
Nothing about tax evasion.
Ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing on the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
No hyperlink to the original documents so that an opinion can be taken.
Go to see today Tuesday 15 October the results of miracle revenues: in Spain, exports are at the lowest level in five years.
In Greece the stock market is collapsing.
However, it seems the examples to follow.
The reform of notaries would generate a claim for compensation of the order of EUR 8 billion.
The Ministry of Economy tells us that these claims are unfounded.
What about the error of the Ministry of the Economy?
Will the decision-makers who have made the political profit resulting from the courageous attack by the notaries have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The rest in its time.
Okay, thank you, JYL....
The State is not comparable to households in terms of the management of its budget because the temporal horizon of the State is theoretically infinite whereas that of the household is limited by the lifespan of its members.
Moreover, unless public expenditure is considered unproductive, it helps to finance tangible and intangible investments that will support future growth and thus future revenues.
Some elements of response.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrates: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first and foremost.
Pretty conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth does not match your fantasy.
Medical personnel would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands tied by the law as written by the politicians.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical interventions, safe shoot rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues, politicians want to please the uncultured masses.
By the way, doctors don't make money from drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't make money from drugs. Since the Liberals want our health system to look like the one in the United States, you should find out how it works.
Phys doctors around the world are courted in the same way, but it's more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to blame the toubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, are giving priority to corporate profits and “research”.
So read the few reports on our spending on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare the world's prices of medicines everywhere, as well as differences between countries in over-the-counter or only on prescription.
This is being reinforced, it is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations for oncological pain, despite the laws that slow them down and the expensive permits needed.
Although manufacturers of certain medicines may not be happy that alternatives such as marijuana are being used, those who arrive at a version offering good quality products at known doses will greatly benefit.
Sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong, a lot is happening behind the scenes for the doctors and the pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were glad to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a hospital manager.
We can't DOWN patents on the grass...
If social scientists were to do research instead of politics and networking, their “works” could be used.
One researcher surveyed, he did not compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not looking.
Comparing is about doing pedagogy, not research.
We cannot say 'the research is complete, we must apply it' and then in the same jet 'we must experiment with everything'.
If your research is complete, why experiment?
If your research is not complete, why do you ask that they be applied?
Can I explain how a “researcher” can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies make it possible to learn on the condition that students learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they cannot learn?
Pisa tests are just an indicator that makes us an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What's the point of building an indicator that informs you of what suits you, a desire for self-promotion, a deception?
A single avenue for training teachers: to distance sophists and ideologues from training and which practitioners teach practitioners.
re-read the paragraph on traineeships (which, unfortunately, is not very much argued) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most inefficient conservatism: “It is a device that leads above all to the reproduction of current practices, and which does not allow us to move the system forward.”
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, it is not possible to hope that only practitioners will teach practitioners, even if they have their full place in a modern teacher training.
Education theorists should have no place.
Practitioners, must have one.
Would you like to be operated on by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating theater before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system.
Giving more weight to education theorists would destroy it once and for all.
Your analogy is totally messy: if I would not like to be operated on by a practitioner who has only theoretical training, I would even less like to have surgery by a surgeon who has no theoretical background and who has learned on the job.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative MP for Anti-Copyright Violation, David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thank you.
If one day I start to feel guilty about infringing copyright, I just have to read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement - vol.
It is the same as they must cite their sources correctly.
Often, obtaining a licence does not cost anything.
No, it is a violation of copyright.
Not the same thing at all.
By using content without having the right license, you deprive artists of their livelihood.
You can always debate pedantic hypotheses -- but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, but it won't become true.
It is a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating copyright
Obviously you don't mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school homework, an almost perfect definition of what a reasonable use should be, then I'm glad to deprive them of that fictitious income.
Lesson 1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and post it on their favorite social networks, they abandon any intellectual property to the site under the general conditions they have passed by a click.
Maybe if they share their mp3 player's headphones with a boyfriend on the school bus, they should be evicted for breaking the law in such a way.
Ah if we could export this resource that we're full of, the gruesome who says everything's going wrong...
If a PS Member says so, then we must believe it.
I have two children, and when they are old enough to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France pulls people down by continuously assisting them.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy will have created.
What pulls France down is speeches like yours.
I've been working in private company forever.
I had the CHANCE to have worked in companies run by excellent entrepreneurs: it exists in France but it is rare.
I am a salaried employee because I know that I do not have the skills to run a company and this choice allows me to shoot red balls at the null bosses that I meet frequently.
At ease in my sneakers I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horrible truth.
Compared to the German companies that French entrepreneurs constantly cite to call for reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large companies and the medium-sized and small - What do the French employers expect to do so??
That the state is holding their hands?
This state that they accuse of imperiousness?
- Jacques L.
Always this anti-entrepreneur couplet from you.
Remember, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be so harsh?
I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is facing an intractable problem: the incompetence of French entrepreneurs who are unable to create jobs and who are shying and swinging while waiting for the permanent state assistance.
It's terrible.
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employers' charges, taxes, work 45 hours/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggshells, dare to demand a reduction in wages if they are not being cut.
I look forward to seeing all the “negative” comments on this subject.
Which is ironic given how people always complain about First Group.
From what I see from where I am, Last has not really been an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep themselves afloat rather than transform.
That doesn't mean that the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of it.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do that, unfortunately.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't succeed.
But hey, Labour is going to get us bored, isn't it...
It's an international subsidiary.
They are already operating trains in Germany.
There is nothing to prevent people in the United Kingdom from starting a more moral company and taking part in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at management, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and the criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all in order for the decision to finally be overturned.
And there's better: MTR, a Hong Kong company won Crossrail's 8-year operating contract.
Well Labour, as they told us during the referendum campaign, is totally for pooling and sharing and believes that all workers must help each other across borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be happy with this decision ;)
This may be because the management of the Dutch is on the right track when the British are not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership, but above all new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
"She was a beating girl."
Lord, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Assuming that being "beating" is a higher quality than many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "ballant" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous 'beaten', who are no less dead, I know of polopads.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, we'll do it again too.
I'm not telling you that this is THE condition for gerying, I'm telling you it's how it looks like.
Nothing to do with any merit.
As for the examples of your life, it's only you to judge them.
I'll do it again.
Insinuating, even for a moment, that we can have merit in getting out of an illness or that one can deter not to get out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that lets go, everywhere, despite the will, despite the confidence in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
Surless to think otherwise, if, to have a solid morale probably makes it easier to accept and prepare for heavy treatments, to try experimental treatments as this woman did and not to refuse them out of fear.
Someone who is beating in medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts medicine.
But if you prefer to rely on the "lord," it's something else.
Neither with the deserved nor with the courage.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you get so stripped of becoming just a zombie.
Personally, I caught two of them, dirt, big ones, and if I "still" as these psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight consists only of clamping the teeth, suffering hell and grabs the blows.
I thought the accusation against Milosevic was decided and finalised a decade ago.
I haven't seen that name in the newspapers for at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted “rapidly” and then swept under the carpet.
Is this the story we told at the time?
The communist who has become a nationalist who has unleashed three wars in the Balkans over the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we deliberately left out: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the MOINDRE rule of international law?
Which country has Serbia attacked?
Comments on RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why do you not mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, it would be swallowed by the Western compressor.
Westerners used a smokescreen to detach a part of a sovereign State that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and waspresibly recognized by Western states, which then lied end to the situation on the ground.
The Serb population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term for not having understood the situation that had developed.
Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
At the end of the day, the Guardian should not call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we do not like him).
To my knowledge, in Greece, only one method of predicting earthquakes works roughly, measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
Such studies are undoubtedly useful and please share the results with us.
This water has nothing to do with the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years from the Earth in the Cygnus constellation that would be "the smallest and coldest planet to have detectable water molecules," according to a study conducted by Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine's team.
Method to be followed, therefore.
Just like those that involve animals that feel a threat to happen.
Thank you Science Passer to feast, often, on the experimental prowess that are done around the world.
How would animals know (in advance)?
Probably by the perception of other elements whose rates are changing in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
A gas that is a priori odourless for humans but may be detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for humans, but not for the measuring instruments at his disposal.
However, we do not have a reliable result on these tracks ...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely with an earthquake, including hens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen a report on arte about the struggle of two scientific teams, one in California, the other in Japan, to have the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to the Earth's magnetic fields, and more specifically to their modification before a seism.
So of course I am not a scientist, but their hypotheses had convinced me.
Or are we on this research?
Why so much contempt for this trail?
We should relearn to listen to nature...
If we look at things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious journal, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the “signs” given by animals, we come up against the same bias: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the goldfish was ringing strangely in circles.
I don't understand why we might think that Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He did too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program, you can't help but think that this man doesn't know anything about it and that he always tries to make a diversion with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said that he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari asked him what.
He could not name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected as mayor and he did not hold a single one.
It just underscores how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, right?
Because it's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because it's a celebrity and we've taught people the adoration of celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him and the rest of the country will vote for him.
When (and not if) he is taking the lead in the party, the Tories' popularity rating will puncture the ceiling I'm sure.
May God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but don't want their prime minister to be one.
That is exactly what we were saying to the people of London.
He should have brought with him his friend the block, smarter than him
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson
The Americans had one as President.
The French have truly and always disinterested themselves in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have taken the trouble to read some books (there are some, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the “Solomon” and the “strait of scrap metal” speak, unfortunately as the deaths that remained there.
It is understandable that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruiser, Australia, must always be there from the bottom since the Battle of Savo) do not want to return.
We are indeed in front of the island of Savo, in the 'Iron Bottom Sound'.
Even if the mission is coming to an end.
It's the little ones.
But the ecolo side is a total smoke.
Calculate the kerozene consumes to achieve the goal that completely discredits the concept.
Just browse the list of sponsors Que of philanthropists.
A more com operation neither did not do it.
The cow, it makes you want to.
I look forward to the webseries.
Your recit makes me revere, by identifying me a little in the process (I also learned to sail with the Crocos de L’Elorn at the Moulin Blanc en rade de Brest).
Chap also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of the displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Keep on making us revere, and show with pride that the Bretons are great travellers.

Good evening I think the red cap that has protested against taxes is pleased to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not spend a penny of our taxes on financing the dreams of even as friendly as those.
Are there any players in the current Serbian language of Kosovo origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly in Juventus and now in Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I do not know if they are still on the team
This is Bisevac, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was midfielder or before in the 1970s and 1980s and coached many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as a striker in Velez's big team who, under the tutelage of the legendary Suleman Rebac, finished twice in second place in the Yugoslav League (and also had shoals like Vahid Halilhodzic and Arsène Wenger's loyal teammate Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you, Mole.
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was in Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn Frisson.
Here, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to the Fener and as far as I know he didn't start.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, is not afraid.
You should love Albania because you are neighbours.
The thing is, the flag of this drone is not the flag of today's real Albania.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is a significant Albanian presence.
A little bit of excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (which I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Greater Albania, but of pre-1913 Albania, when the major European powers decided to give ends of the country to neighbouring countries.
How can one feel "an explosion of joy" when we see two towers collapsed knowing that women, men and no-doubt children are inside?
How???
What annoys me a little in this 'testimony' is that the mere fact of having been able, even once, to spontaneously rejoice at the horrible death of thousands of people, testifies to me of a 'border line' personality whose 'testimonies' should be taken with the utmost circumspection.
Perhaps in the short time of "joy", one will not have thought of the deaths or of the reality of the horror inflicted.
We just thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had succeeded in making the great villain Satan in his very heart really and apocalypepticly evil.
To be made qqch of a powerful.
Grandiose.
It would appear that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims who are gnawed by their sense of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfreude.
We suspected it.
The "Christian/white/Gaul" West cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of musuman when he contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today's Arab Muslim world.
I am talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past splendour, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How do we get the Muslim world out of this diabolical funnel?
Intense, two major poisons irrigate the Arab world: the bigy conservatism of the powers in power and the fascinating nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (sweet or armed) of its critical expression.
That we have understood it before, must not push back the Muslims.
That is the only way.
Has Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose that is true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long, dark, wet, and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
In addition, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is breathtaking in the autumn.
Not as breathtaking as the green of summer when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We've had a nice summer this year, don't make your grumpy cliché.
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in the winter.
But now I'm retired and I'm no longer developing immunity to the germs outside, it can change, I guess.
It's not being about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a febrile that culminates with festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snow and many other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things.
These are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of mark-ups for children, the amount received by the State comes mainly from the deciles 8 to 10 .
However, with regard to the number of households having had their taxes increased as a result of this measure, it is above all the deciles 4 and 5 which are concerned (median incomes) according to Chart 2 .
The abolition of the half share, especially for widows, is not dealt with at all in the article, or rather its impact is completely assessed: EUR 230 million is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And it's not going to get better.
Well, we're not on the straw, but thinkers
For once the PS is a rather left-wing policy, we're not going to cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20% have to pay far more than 75% of the tax hike, why not 90%?
Let's continue like this and you'll encourage that 20% to work less or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I say it anyway.
Long live the Trets and the OICs recycled to the PS: they have understood everything.
Adam, you can see what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it forbids anyone to raise as much as they can.
Beyond a certain limit, the money loses its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money is overtaken, money is only used to make money, i.e. to say to make the misfortune of the greatest number.
We're one of the richest 20 percent.
Probably also the 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth, some of which is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must enable these homes to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or you give up and live on minimum social benefits, especially if you have social housing.
The utopias of the khmer Rouge-headed cutters have happily lived.
I made two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we wouldn't have had in a five-star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the reception or deal with any hassle.
Just go to someone's house, sleep there, put it behind you and go back.
From now on, this will be my first option when I'm on a trip.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before you rent your house.
In most cases you will need some kind of homeowner insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo.
Ah, six hours too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky" No, it's not true.
You just ran out of luck.
Based on the link provided in the article:
At his discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was quick, almost absurdly quick.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred 23,817 euros (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complain that he has not received any support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as if to travel
Hello I'm looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I'm considering paying a down payment and a month's rent at once, but I'm a little afraid to send 1,600 dollars to a site I've never really heard of.
But where are we going?
"Support the troops", the Buheria sang in all tones...
So harmless weapons.
I am sure that it will please the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurds who died in Halabja to learn that their relatives and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombing of Sadg Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically changed by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polite).
Moreover, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still usable?
It is not very clear the author’s style: “in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You believe it is time to weaken the army to strengthen education
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is ALWAYS the time to strengthen education, because we're still at war?
Education would already be strengthened by “they” would already be “worked 35 hours instead of 17 hours.”
At the moment, our teachers are now earning more than engineers.
And let us not be made to believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their curriculum.
But this is not seen since the National Education does not have the means to provide an office in the college/lycée to its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework in short, except that the employer pays neither the computer, nor the internet connection, nor the supplies.
Besides, it is so hidden at 5 p.m. per week and 4 months of vacation that we can't fill CAPES with math, come on, we're waiting for you.
How do you not want to stick up poorly educated horse mads whose parents spit on you while calling yourself a wanker?
I believe that the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadites so that the Khurde population can flourish better.
Where one sees that the Bush administration has absolutely gone wrong.
My first graduate job was in the sale, in London, to earn three times nothing, and yet it was a job for which you needed a degree.
A year later, I saw an advertisement to be a worker for the London Underground, it was paid an extra 5,000 dollars a year and we didn't even ask for the patent.
I never regretted it.
On this subject, don't worry if you can't find a graduate job, try to find something that pays well, or you like to do it.
If I had stayed at the graduate jobs, I would still have to pay my student loan.
I don't really like work in business, so I hope to eventually move on to the public service or in academia.
LOL LOL This article is coming really late.
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a three-year backlog.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Get rid of bisouncury courses such as art/art/ théâtre/media/philosophy/political science, i.e. so-called diplomas of the unemployed.
I have one of these degrees and I've finished production director.
It turned out that the important thing was not the diploma but, as the article above says, a good career path, starting at school and throughout the university.
While the starting salary was lower, the starting salary was quickly raised, because in the real world what matters was the results more than knowledge.
This debate as an engineer/artistic browses has been going on for years.
Scientists can't solve all the problems, it's more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time and interact with people in order to get results.
Are letters, philosophy and art baking?
That's ridiculous.
I guess you're talking about media research genre degrees or whatever absconse's stream you've been to.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real subjects.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the basics of culture like literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Would it not be better a real territorial policy to relieve the congestion of Paris and boost the rest of France?
Personally, I can hardly see the inhabitants of the end-of-the-ground of Essonne and Val-d'Oise making 80 km round trip every day by bike to come and work in Paris.
The intramural and small belt inhabitants already have many more convenient means of public transport (metro, bus, tram).
Several secure and locked parks, as already exists in the cities of northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the roads.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RMs.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
It is as well as benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well, no room has been found for a single bicycle hooking device.
The motivation seems to be stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoi.
Okay, it's not right at all.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other public transport users the reasons why they do not pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that stand out are: 1/ it is hyper dangerous with all these cars, these lorries, these scooters that drive super fast and get into the survival of the bikes 2/ we get a lot of pollution in the head For me the cycle tracks are to go, we have to reduce the car traffic.systematically verbalizing (even bikes on the flat meadow that the traffic code written for cars 100 years ago to bicycles), generalising the buffer zones after the studded passages, not before, otherwise the cars and scooters do not interfere.
Cycling tracks are apartheid, we must live together but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in the greater Paris?
Not a word on the place of cycling on public transport?
EELV is right.
The target of 15% bike travel is ridiculous.
I'm beginning to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
Moreover, according to OR, the EELV deputies seem sceptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racketeering began, it would be better to find who is really behind this massacre.
Hint: it's not Russia.
Not sure to love the way the world evolves.
It sounds horrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I did not hear that a complaint had indeed been lodged.
In addition, they should file a complaint first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not at fault, the fault lies with the airspace safety authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident foreseeable?
Other aircraft had previously been shot down, Ukraine was launching air attacks on the rebels in the area and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian Government taken reasonable precautions in the light of an obvious threat or did it choose to play with the lives of innocent people to pay the airlines' overflight rights?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls defending their usurper government/webternally ultra-nationalists of western Ukraine – and who want to broadly demonstrate that Putin shot MH17.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their sky.
The precedent: a 1986 decision of the International Court of Justice that concluded that the supply of weapons by the CIA to the Contra rebel forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for its actions.
There is no chance that Russia will leave this case to go to the ICJ.
It's funny to think that Abbott wants to tell Putin that Australians were murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope that he can present evidence to support his allegations.
So far, the investigators have said nothing of the sort.
To be called Ricardo and to be such a Beothian in eco is distressing.
To be called Polar is to lose the north is rejoicing.
One question on the question of Beetian: is the poor man of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I can't stop noticing that those who criticize Piketty's book the most virulatic didn't read it.
It's easy to read, it takes a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequalities-concentration, inequality of income from labour, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that the concentration of today's capital is in line with that of the beginning of the 20 degrees Celsius before 1914, it shows that it was the two world wars that reduced the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration resumed after...
Bernajuzan: you say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has some limitations.
Secondly, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is fair or not.
If it is right, it can be debated without having read the book, the main one of which is to argue in one direction in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did you take to read it?
Is the central thesis of his paving block summarized by the press wrong?
I haven't read it and will not read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis, and this is the one that seems to me to be pure fumistry.
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Has humanity not globally enriched itself?
And this enrichment, together with an increase in population, is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the prize without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17 years old.
An age at which most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope that this prize will not be a burden on the girl and that she will find her way to live a happy life.
The problem is not the price, but the political capital of Western governments, which want to prove the old adage that the colored perverts are the embodiment of evil.
I wish Malala's happiness, but she must realize that it is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the working-class districts of Great Britain.
Did anyone think his speech was a little strange?
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that, if she wasn't where she was now, she would have been married at the age of 14.
Isn't Malala herself part of these "colored perverts"?
You shouldn't have any "airtime" on this site.
You are, yourself, a horrible pervert.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father was not going to marry her at the age of 14.
She was 15 years old when she was shot.
His father ran a school where girls were educated and he was in favour of equal rights for women.
He is, and has always been, to receive a higher education and have the right to decide for her own marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, as he thinks that women are equal to men.
What she said was that an average Pakistani girl often had to marry at the age of 14, without having a say.
Sorry she didn't say it eloquently enough for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps she means that, if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at the age of 14.
Pretty disappointed by this season 4 entry and especially by Jessica Lange who obviously has a little difficulty finding her lookalike character Marlene Dietrich.
I have just watched the last two seasons which are quite different but I have to admit that it is one of the best horror series, one of the most successful.
A fascinating first episode.
The film is close to perfection and Jessica Lange's show singing Bowie's anachronistic Life on Mars is simply stunning.
I haven't watched this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I prefer to have all of a sudden watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is certain, apart from the extraordinary Jessica Lange, it is above all the risks of stagings and montages that suit me.
In AHS we have an avalanche of original plans that make a pretty much foolish about the asepticization of today’s productions.
It does not escape me a little to see you throw in the towel in advance for the coming seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge its quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series, but, as you say so well, there are many other things.
No, it's just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her path and the way she uses it) is really ONE of the pillars of the series outside the technical qualities.
And well, I look a lot at her.
Then I think the series sinned by writing, it wants to do too much things at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in the 2 it was too dispersed despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's going to end up as 24 hours chronologically what.
But everyone does what you want.
It is by what I say, 'I will no longer look then', that everyone is obliged to do the same.
I just share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think it will be fatal to her.
But then, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less tax hikes, please - let's cut more in state spending.
No, let's increase spending, please.
Those who wanted to slash in spending failed.
Launching polemics about relatively small items of expenditure, such as development assistance
The problem is that this is less than the margin for error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of direction that voters seem to be calling for, and all the time some in every side pretend that these nuances are far more important and substantial than they are - and voters see their game clearly and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1 per cent of expenditure.
“Debt” is assets held mainly by financial institutions in that country.
“Debt” is nothing to worry about.
I would not see any problem in the government taking over a third of my income (even before talking about consumption taxes) if I thought it would be using it wisely.
But that is not the case, and many taxpayers have the same feeling.
It is said that Nigel Farage was not quite honest about how to reduce taxes, but if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies to roughly useless wind turbines and nuclear power plants that cost twice what they should, you arrive at a figure that makes the tax on the most expensive residences seem ridiculous.
Your first 10,000 dollars is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns 35,000 dollars a year will pay about 5,000 dollars (one seventh of their salary), someone with 50,000 dollars would pay around 10,000 dollars (one fifth), etc. and someone with 200,000 dollars pays about 70,000 dollars (just over a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social security contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking fees and the car vignette, and it is before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is taken at source before local taxes and the car vignette.
I am paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm glad to pay my taxes.
But let us not pret mean to believe that money falls from the sky, or that it is not important to know where billions of pounds pass.
How can an unemployed person looking for door-to-door work prove it?
Even if 20 percent of the unemployed wouldn't, that means that 80 percent are looking and not finding.
Being even unemployed, am I more interested in others looking for or not?
Whether a potential recruiter gets 10 or 20 CVs increases my chances by the same amount.
Indeed, I haven't had any news of Pôle Emploi for months, does that mean that agents are more busy with control operations than really getting job advertisements?
I see no interest.
Because it is not up to the state to do work.
If Pole Emploi does not provide enough jobs, then you have to do without Pole Emploi.
What is this a sensitive issue?
We all have rights and duties, and we are making sure that the unemployed perform their duties in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks for their tickets to the users of a means of transport, a head of service or are the employees of their work, etc.
Nobody's shouting scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed worth remembering that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had to deal with Pôle Emploi, my rights to ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the dossiers, amputated by 40%, it was necessary to fight firm.
It takes time.
I'm not an expert in law.
Filing and control is currently gaining the upper hand, while currently, Pôle Emploi is, in fact, close to being an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern employees, it is they who pay the subsidisation.
Non-employed French politicians and French are granted rights that they do not actually have.
That is not normal.
I would add that a dignified unemployment insurance contributes to the promotion of wage work.
More than waiting for murderous tweets in Arabic...
In fact, we must have a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the Black Death in 1348/9 in connection with war and population displacements at the time.
The Saudis had the presence of the spirit to ban Hajj in Mecca this year from Muslim desiles from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have had their visa application refused because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox in Mecca during the 1930s, probably infected with a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope that the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from flying to Europe?
I thought it was just common sense, but apparently those who "know" decided that you could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be strictly quarantined.
No one goes out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract Ebola while they're out there, they stay there until they're cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Last week alone, people were infected after contact with people in West Africa, despite taking “all necessary precautions”.
The advance of this disease can be stopped.
It is spread mainly by airlines.
Let us forbid them to offer to fly to these countries.
In addition, airport customs officers should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms, so that they can be quarantined immediately.
Let him get the message of the first individual and the second (including religious) group and he will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he is capable of creating as dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It is still far from this conception.
It is only 20 years since information emerged as the premium of humanity, while religion, derived from the cerebellum, has led our actions since Lucy perhaps.
What is the point of becoming an umpteenth Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is largely in the minority in France today, no one is forced to join.
Those who criticize would not put their feet on the Church anyway, but only the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxiogenous"?
Sorry the church has no vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe it will reach more people...
'Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you see it existed before Christ.
Hillel a century before him once said, "Do not do to others what you don't want to be done to you, that's the whole Torah and the rest is just comment: go and study."
Christianity goes far beyond mere reciprocity but introduces a spawning.
Your "promising justice, peace, fraternity" but without God?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Next step: the incarnation and the resurrection are removed.
Jesus will remain that hero who has upset moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace and fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the small number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and converted by force and pushed into immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate too much to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
It doesn't invent.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in his fundraising campaign) but I don't think that's worth 30 dollars.
If you're interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming is currently selling SoM for 30 dollars and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for 30 euros and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll look.
Obviously not at work.
The computer department's roundabout blocks all cool sites.
Hello, is it 30 dollars and then 20% off, or does the 30 plus go pay for the 20% discount?
Be careful though: the PC version is only for DX11.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but can't play it.
Besides, I bought it on Steam, so no refund is zero.
It's time to buy a new video card.
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon 30 for PC, 35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, 44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they'll wipe it off from your library if they decide to crack down on the people who buy it there while they're out of the planned area.
So join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So was France in 1940 a "trearing earth"?
Say, this Nobel Prize seems to me to be a poisoned gift.
We must love France 40, the "strange defeat" France?
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize in Literature, you wonder if Proust or Dostoyevsky would have it today.
The Nobel Prize is not even an event, we don't even want to read the award-winning authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians will read Modiano, who is already difficult to read in French and who describes such a limited and self-centered universe?
I hope that the other Nobels are more credible, but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant connection with literature.
Did you read it at least?
Or another Nobel Prize?
That would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, the Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano is worth it, if they don't already know him.
For your part, continue to frequent Lévy and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso retained their chances.
So let's see who got the Nobel Prize for Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hi the awful ones.
Ever since I drove one in Iceland, I haven't stopped seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this thing has followed me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like the horrible Superman III computer?
Hello Dantra, still hatred?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday.
I had a few days' rest.
It was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham beer and cider festival.
It was messy.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there weren't just CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with camera fanatics).
Driving on the back on Sunday was really hard.
On Monday night we went to a buddy's grandfather's house to play the nine card brag.
Thanks to a real beginner's chance, I was able to leave with several decent bets.
I hope that if I get to 95 I'll be as sharp as he is.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came up with a slice of bacon on it.
I admire Mr.
Read a little Buddha and you'll understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, without wishing to upset you, I think you are a little moving away from the subject.
This famous totality, it prohibits quests for jihadists when they leave mosques.
She reported on arms trafficking without delay.
Either we have eyes wide open like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or we have large eyes closed.
You have to choose.
It is not by keeping your eyes closed that you access the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but again, you are making a monumental counter-sension: all the authorities, organisations or associations that are representative, Muslim or not, having formally condemned the EI and its crimes, the French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official condemnations.
Who does not say a word consent.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, there is doubt for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the Jewish French of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and of demanding that they demonstrate publicly to the rest of the French society that it is wrong to doubt it.
In my view, this principle is the negation of the Republic and can only help to disintegrate French society.
If there is no doubt, as well say it.
Who does not say a word consent, but consents to what?
Consent to a proximity to IA or to the conviction of IA.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to spare the goat and the cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the elections, “revenge” parties in Westminster because a huge gap widened between their decentralization proposals and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified at the idea of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must laugh.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives are completely messing with Scotland as they have no seats.
They can do what they want with electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that Labour losing seats in Westminster to SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who will shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP, which will cut their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMESSE" thinking that he was saving his party but not realizing that he was signing the death order of his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs hold their leader accountable.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and the Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's the important thing.
Not if Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Chopping the 8 per cent pumps to the detriment of 85% is not a great electoral strategy.
In addition, once Scottish Members can no longer vote on matters concerning England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think it is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists and it did well.
Yet he has been in the running for prime minister in 2015 and this since he won the Labour Party leadership.
So, basically, these boxes will be virtually behind every reader to look over his shoulder and see what he's reading, how he reads, and to the end.
It's "The lives of others" in East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Always the same fascination with monitoring techniques.
In the long term, this will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I'm waiting for the next post: Amazon makes your book according to YOUR profile and automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret.
It's cheerful as a world.

Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I still have the reading of pirated files, books in the public domain or bought from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without a snoop.
Given the price I paid for the Kobo, it is without regret.

At your general public bookseller, you will always notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn-c, iterative, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are arguably derisory.

But Kobo has all this information.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish Government in recent days that the country seems to be run by a kindergarten class full of schizophrenics under acid.
It's even worse than that if you take Erdogan's religious fundamentalism into account.
It's interesting that some Erdogan supporters think that Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey doesn't want to shoot itself in the foot unless you get something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will retaliate, so it's actually shooting herself in the foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog: "The PA reports that Iran has warned the US that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad as this would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending a serious warning of reprisals or simply advising prudence.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what really surprises is that today the Iranian and US diplomatic commitment concern Syria, Israel and the security of the region.”
The reading of Indian Punchline is to be strongly recommended to anyone who pays attention to detail rather than to the ringing of traditional media. The short article you link to is important and should be read bearing in mind realistic observations/alternations from Iran proposing from Afghanistan around 1979-1980.
Who are these “moderates” who are seriously fighting the horrendous secular Assad and at the same time the ISIS perverse?
Pipeline policy pushes the world towards abhor, and I would suggest that those who refer to non-existent “moderates” pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in World War III.
“It’s even worse than that if you take Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism into account.” Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in mind.
There should be a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
"Should"?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have any chance of still being alive?
A little late for that, buddy...
Wouldn't criminals be barely old now, like 120 years?
A little late for that, right?
Especially with regard to the CUP triumvirate that planned and led the genocide, Talaat and Jemaal killed just after World War I by vengeance by the Armenians, and Ender killed by the Bolsheviks in a paucadoed place in Central Asia around the same time, when he went there with the dream of founding a Turkish empire there.
What a delirium.
An impressive mastery of the sophism of fatal slope, but apart from that, we seek contact with the real in vain.
So many clichés without arguments.
The fetus will always hear a heart that beats even in the belly of a surrogate mother.
Lesbian couples may simply have a desire for a child and not a desire to be accepted.
Sterile straight couples as well.
As for the children.
What a shame it is to refer to them as psychological unbalanced future.
One day, they will be old enough to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn a living and to pay for the lady's retirement (?)
GPA is undoubtedly a temporary "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world is experiencing.
It is not today.
Many women have brought and gave birth to children who were not of their husbands.
This is still the case, we are so made...
What is important in this area is that this practice should be regulated so that the "mopening" of the body is limited.

In the late '70s in the Midlands I only saw this from a distance.
I had to go there the day because I wasn't allowed to go at night.
But if you like that and you listen to music -- this music today it still touches you so much.
I don't know why there are so many contemptuous comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they're posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years.
I think there is an article on football in the sports section that awaits your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there has been a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of the culture of Northern England.
No wonder Paul Mason understood the social and political context, he understands things well.
Northern soul still lives, but it has been vampirized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can throw an ear in it if you are in the London area in November: 99psoul will again pass soul vinyls, including a full of Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at the Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I, too, thought, "Always the same story," but here's a little, well-written and well-thought-out little article.
Your criticisms really need to be more constructive.
Great article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're glad you escaped Newsnight.
Last train to Victoria Wigan/Exchange and get off at Wallgate.

The Palestinians do not have a partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
Jonathan: Netanyahu is not looking for peace because he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (by the way, Rabin was also the case).
It is clear that Rabin, Netanyahu and their constituents all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock and entered the water.
An Israeli had stolen them from him.
The Israeli representative got angry and vociferated: "What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren't even there at the time."
The Palestinian representative (United Nations) smiles and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its people have no confidence in the bipolar government of Palestinian authority and will not lower their guard...
It is obvious that it does not dislike anti-Israelis, it is not the aim...
Antiionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
And this has always been the case since the Politics is globalized ...
Avoidance, avoidance...
In the Israeli-colonial conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it certainly continues.
You don't answer for the creation of Israel.
What balance of power did Israel create?
Anti-ionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a balance of power today.
Do you doubt that? ... ...
Besides, it doesn't just revolve around Russell Brand, but Guardian reporters seem to have trouble going beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
Much of what he says are only pseudo-chomskyist marbleves written no others.
This proves that you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a series of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes her, which would mean it's a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a hint of awareness that Russell Brand is telling certain truths, perhaps truths that we prefer not to think about.
Hold on, this feeling is going to be more and more common.
I can understand why Brand horripile some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the tabloid absurdities he actually gives the impression of being a beginner populist, but this whole story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and instead cross our arms and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at the interview of Paxman and other articles/videos he posted, he says that voting once every 5 years only for Labour or Conservatives (or the Lib Dems I suppose) and limit the democratic commitment to this is completely useless.At no point does he say that he simply completely ignore politics because these parties do not govern on our behalf: he insists that rather than just voting and disconnecting for five years, people should become much more politically active at the local level, organize movements, demonstrations, petitions, whatever and try to influence politics from that.
I'm not saying I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being politically active in presenting one's requests can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are windweets who will change their mind if they really risk losing the elections), but it's raging to see all these condescending answers that say that this fool who makes Jesus tells young people not to take the right thing to vote.
His solution is highly questionable and it would be nice if people debated what he actually said rather than simply labeling him as irresponsible and putting aside the concerns of him and a great number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The voting thing was completely distorted.
The uselessness of swiping a ballot in a ballot box every five years annoys me deeply, since my vote really does not count for anything.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and Members who report to their voters locally.
Furthermore, I dispute the idea that Russell Brand's remarks are not his own (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own words and ideas, even though these are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counterculture that Suzanne would like to group together under the label "pseudo-Chemskyist marbleves".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in persuading Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne does like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the nods added to the editing.
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russell but ended up becoming one of his fans and invited him on his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to go.
It draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by the traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
This “slinging” reveals above all, in my view, that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time at the RDVs of history, where professional historians have become a minority and where exchanges of specialists have become impoverished for the benefit of condensed readiness-to-thinker Sciences Po for press files.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to attack a culprit, a scapegoat.
They both develop very rational reasoning, but this rationality is based on those scapegoats that are the keystone of their thoughts.
Rather, I believe that the State was indispensable for Foucault as a culprit.
This is a very archaic thought, sacrificial thought, which is also magical thinking.
The problem of the ratio is solved by eliminating it.
There is an anarchizing slope, neo-lib and/or/or-free (both terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing how to seek the relief of the state for its markets) in the sense of at least state / not at all in the state of Foucault.
The old dream of the base that is beautifully self-organizing.
Her thought is built on the guilt of the State: without this guilt she does not stand up.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a statement against the three intellectuals mentioned here.
Nor support, by the way.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of his then god, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you probably read a choua too quickly if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for a Khomeini apology.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel in this way...
Gauchet is deeply considering the contemporary individual and the collective, about the difficulty that the mechanism of accession represents in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.
Seeing this cabal orchestrated by hard-left-wing humanities researchers who can't stand the wholeness of their mantras, is quite laughable.
The narcisisism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these 'rebels', which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chinese and other “yellows” that I witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends on this subject, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian woman could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I last saw a Chinese.
In London and they were sympathetic to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same about whites.
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them making violently anti-white talk.
My father is not happy that his eldest daughter is dating a white man.
I also believe that attitudes in Russia have changed since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are richer and richer, prosperity is spreading outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity, people travel abroad and see how others live.
As I have been told, Russians are mostly prejudiced against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in occupations and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or facing high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the River Ienisei, in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard the views of Australians on Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me I can't stand the Chinese, when I've met two in my life (one abroad), didn't keep bad memories of them, all the people are equal and, in fact, those in London have been very kind, that's why I remembered that they were Chinese.
Otherwise we don't remember who we meet, all the people are equal, how to remember who was who.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here talk about the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with said White.
How many Chinese men are with white men, by comparison?
None, because there is a long chance that the parents of these Blanches would attack them PHYSICAL.
No measure of the impartiality of justice.
However, she is the mother of all the battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left such as the union of the judiciary ...
Marabout: sorry, but the judicial circle is frankly a right.
As for the Magistracy Union, it represents only 25% of judges.
If a measure of its partiality can be made from the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it calls for two obstacles to be removed.
That of the observer’s political vision, as well as that of the magistrate’s factual interpretation.
It remains the obligatory tool of the law to refocus the assessment on the fundamentals.
The measurement of its non-compliance in all judicial acts of judges, including the public prosecutor’s office, forces the distinction between error and partiality of judges.
It would be pointless to claim that the acts of justice were not distributed among those three groups.
Presence and ignorance are not subject to objective analysis.
And if all this is not analysed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
Except only by implicitly revealing statistics that it starts from very low.
The preceding preamble makes it possible to correctly write down the following in the third ratio.
The corruption of the judiciary.
Significantly, a question of the power of nuisance conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The area in question is that of the dispossession of heirs committed until a scam to the proceedings by genealogists of succession commissioned by notaries.
This profession gets EUR 150 million in a year and is still receiving the coverage provided by the quasi-judicial impunity of the French notary.
For the understanding of their mechanism, part of this has been reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this is in line with the above-mentioned statistical improvement, which is moderated by the previous comment, the judicial institution has produced, in numerous disputes between genealogist and heirs who are thus reluctant to be dispossessed, a whole series of case laws contrary to all laws favourable to the heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics that ignore these kinds of rational criteria, then, an elaborate form of lies?
Probably totally prohibitive prices.
More equipment to scam the disabled.
You can say that, but my brother has one of these all-terrain tricycles, custom-built to his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like never before a normal wheelchair, with wheels and bulky tires, could not.
As they say, tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks in the shape.
I think the inventor of the Whill never had to clean a dog's mud on a caterpillar.
I'm sure my sister would love the all-terrain tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra-long distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled man with a penchant for longboard.
Here are hills that they liked.
Prices actually seem high, but there are really people who put this kind of price in a bicycle, so "you see."
The all-terrain tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
Not all disabled people are poor, however.
Many of them have reasonable insurance at their disposal.
Only if they became disabled.
The thing is, the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to charge high prices for things that they know they're needed.
You can't really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately, it's just a sketch, there's no plan to make it.
I'm CONTENT that the "long-distance" wheelchair doesn't come to the market, because apparently there's no way to drive that damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive shelling of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been trapped in the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying Power of the Palestinian Territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-old children have lived all their lives under Israeli blockade.
Unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation, also an illegal situation, since the blockade imposes a “collective penalty” on all civilians in Gaza.
"Entrepreneurs working on their projects are moving a little from their cement to the black market" ...
Ah, that's not the wooden tongue, rather made of concrete and armed the lady...
The references are there to support an argument or a fact.
Anti-ionist ...
The right cement goes into the tunnels.
There's the black market, that's for sure, and it's recognized.
Two million human beings have been trapped in the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
Unique situation in the world, a situation unacceptable to anyone who has a heart and moral sense.
The US has a well-kept ground: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded him.
Remember also that after lifting it, Morsi had re-established the blockade.
And I'm a Westerner, so I approve ...
Jonathan ...
The Block is Israeli-Egyptian ...
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built upside down by the people who chose their masters.
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've thought it hard.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the non-profit sharing economy.
Many are just looking for a one-night stand on Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hoping for it) in some other way.
It's always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, owners and tenants who trust each other often stop using Airbnb and process directly in cash, thereby bypassing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all of this.
"What does she rent on"?
No problem with the verb, what's wrong with your grammar?
We don't use the verb "let to" in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you haven't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure that it is 100% in accordance with all safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers to carry out a commercial activity there (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I've tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, in short, it's really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and repainted, sunk, etc. ?
Barges are so slow that if someone tried to steal it, she would always be near where you left her.
Or hijacked by pirates...
All these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our barges...
Where are you going to moor it?
No Marine Le Pen isn't right.
Populism?
There is no truth other than the truth that exposes the facts.
Poverty is on the rise in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who defends what?
In 2017 the mass will be said.
Capitalism is not going to get poorer.
High finance, speculates, plays with our companies, therefore our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, our food, so our food, with the healthcare structures, therefore our health, with our debts and our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and in our money that they hold.
All this in favor of a few hyper-mega-obese fifrics.
Until proven otherwise, FH said: 'my enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance'.
That was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed the former Rothschild bank as Minister of Economy, just to better defend the interests of banksters, who were solely responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there no one else comptant?
You call it how: return your jacket, lower your trousers?
Primary and populist response
In fact, we don't really know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I'm not sure that Spee really "rejected" to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that none of the parties seemed certain of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book Castles of Steel suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was stormy at the beginning of the day; I don't know if that was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Falklands, where, in the photos showing the survivors being rescued, we see a calm and day-to-day sea.
In addition, rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, it doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
"Some confusion among the German ships reigned over the fate of the two armored cruisers, who had disappeared in the dark after stopping shooting, and a chase began.
The Leipzig saw something on fire, but as he approached he saw that it was only a wreck.
The Nurberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, leaning and severely damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his spotlight on the ship's flag, the proposal to surrender was refused and he opened fire, eventually flowing the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee judged that the Good Hope had to escape and stopped searching at 22:15.
Concerned with reports of a British battleship in the vicinity, he set sail north."
So, if that's true, the Germans, trialously in the dark before the invention of the radar, didn't know that a ship had flowed, and therefore couldn't look for survivors.
They also thought that there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area that could have damaged them severely, so in confusion they escaped to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was aware that they would have to make their way through many ships of the Royal Navy.
Cradock's sacrifice had already wronged them and cost them about half of their ammunition, condemning them when they were finally caught.
Several votes were raised by the UMP to request that it be entered into the law for a definitively convicted elected official to be definitively ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect left-wing officials, of course.
Nooon, that's a joke.
FOR THIS IDE I PROPOSED REGISTRATION TO THE WALL OF THE MAGISTRATORS
When will trade unions be banned in the sectors already protected?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Managed by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to appease the very people who will take advantage of their irreversibility to hinder the actions of the real politicians, who are really trying to make things happen, not the beautiful talkers whose immobility is commensurate with their sufficiency.
I met them in the subway around noon with their little "undersults for justice" placards they came from the provinces and didn't differentiate between Bercy and POPB.
She supported the existence of politicized trade unions whose members put the enormous power they held at the service of her party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing, even extreme right-wing trade unions targeted personalities on its side and were leading a legal-media war against them.
Your assertions are completely free of charge.
If, at the moment, the right is paying the judicial situation, it is simply because it has committed acts which are the responsibility of it.
There is no example of a left-wing personality who has had so much to do with justice, but all those who have been the subject of his attention have not had preferential treatment.
It should also be recalled that the left-wing judicial trade union is not the only trade union of judges and is a minority.
The fact that a minister so strongly supports trade unions shows how useful they can be.
The union you are quoting may be a minority among the judges, but its influence is great in the Chancellery, it is no secret.
It is now questionable whether the "mission" of some judges is no more dirty than an education.
You should be satisfied, the SM is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
"Pealing: You forget that magistrates are not officials like any other: they are the only ones who have the power to charge and incarcerate the whole-one-size.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Good morning, Katie Waissel.
I think even the most fame-hungry moron realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised if someone accepted the offer.
Many used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
The One Direction fills stadiums around the world.
Others then sold many records or left for West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who is indeed one of the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Celine Dion, Cliff Richard, all made the Eurovision contest, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else participated in contests in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the British light entertainment stars.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that's what happens anyway to most of the stars who don't participate in the contests.
Few people, after a tube, manage to make others.
In any case, most singers/groups can best expect three albums and one best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name, has fans only in the United Kingdom.
His fame comes in part from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock path, even though in your dreams you think that all the guitar shiverers who smoke grass in their father's garage and swing three chords on a primary school poem will surely become stars and the only question is how much they want to touch even before they release an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western and the people studied – a distance that turns quite quickly to racism, because sacraistic ethnologists present us as far away people as infinitely superstitious and kneaded with ritual bigotry, while most of their ways of doing things are strictly equivalent to our own and inspired, like ours, of everyday practical considerations.
Except you're recklessly interpreting in the opposite direction.
Or, but rather than saying that the drum is devoid of a sacred character, is it better not to admit that our Mariannes and our Molières also do not have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is as a reminder that the sacred is a kind of well-defined object and circumscribed in the religious sphere.
Very interesting article anyway.
It's deco ephemere to furnish the void.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the sense of sacred still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists.
Any other discipline would throw away non-scientific interpretations that last the life of a Mandarin, rarely less than, the life of a Mandarin.
When will there be a comparative criticism of disciplines to make a little fun?
Because what applies to archaeology also applies to the interpretations of other disciplines.
This would provide a dose of healthy modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is totally unjustified.
It is thanks to them that treasures are constantly discovered, valuable testimonies for reconstructing history, understanding societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and previously archaeologists relied on their “instinct” and knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Nowadays, there are such high-performance technical and scientific means that the interpretation of excavations is better, but can always be called into question by other discoveries.
We are here in the middle (and old) polemics about the shamanism advanced by the prehistorian Jean Clottes (cf. his book "The Shamanes of Prehistory", particularly the re-release augmented by the scientific controversy, published by the House of the Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article.
Hedair men like anal sex?
For you Mike, I could get started.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why can't we continue to three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the gutter?
No, but we're not against a play on that.
We couldn't watch a musical on that, on the other hand, it would be too gay.
You could have expected that kind of comment from you.
It looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost over, may I suggest that you move on to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real, courageous journalists, for them to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their own risk.
Rather than sniggering with these stubborn ass jokes.
Not very clever.
Then go.
If these "puerle asshole jokes" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
You also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people are laughing at it?
Nevertheless, we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
amateur video of the crash on the net...??
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images, it is only to protect its interests in no case those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the pilots, it would have gotten out of the safety because at the time or another vehicle (e.g. crusher) was entering the circuit.
But it was necessary to finish quickly before the typhoon which we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not see fit to put forward the time of departure (right TV, advertising, money ...).
But apart from that, they protect the pilots well.
I have seen this, I also share this view.
But there is also that if the very British FOM brings in the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance at the restart to beat the English that was leading then ...
You're going on this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it's okay, I have a little time to find all your kerasets.
No, just no.
There have been lots of F1 conspiracies, but never one that puts commissioners in danger of death for a distant story of the possibility of winning one pilot at the expense of another.
It is not the FOM that pulls out the safety because it is the FIA.
Size shredder.
In view of the amateur images, the absence of an image allows the FIA to avoid troublesome questions such as: How is the Commissioner waving a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is deemed too violent does not mean that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because one of the agitated commissioners clearly sees a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that one is more under a yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark meconaissance of F1.
Yes, dear Etienne, the race is no longer under a yellow flag regime AFTER the scene of the accident, hence the restless green flag.
This is the usual procedure.
The clerk station just downstream of the accident (whichever occurs, it can be 10 meters as at 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to recover a normal pace.
Sensationalism sells advertising.
I used to think that the media was an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm afraid that, in the end, it's just for money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, the fear of not having sex life, the ad and the media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The news does exactly the same thing.
Doing the buzz with information that we really don't need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so you can keep controlling them.
"When tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch fear." It should be "derail," not "pleasure."
Given the medical reference, “parish” is said much better in this context than “de-scale”.
I wonder if all the people who are panic that Ebola could start spreading by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You do them too much credit.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist.
You're confusing Ebola with Murdoch...
Great article, thank you.
A short and concise article that makes abject pseudojournalism beautifully and solidly ridiculously.
It made me laugh.
I am depressed that the media are talking about most things with this optimism upside down.
The aim is once again to keep us sufficiently frightened and anxious (without getting to hysteria) for the government can get us out of hand when it needs it.
I believe that it is perfectly logical that, if we are to have a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it invented itself.
Isn't there anything fundamentally problematic with the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and for still being of this world almost 35 years later.
Moreover, at first it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s and 1990s.
I'm bluffing, living with the certainty of spending it for years .....
Perfectly unnecessary testimony.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only are the testimonies useless: taken in isolation, they cannot be used as a scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
Trafic: Testimonies cannot be used as a scientific material.
Perhaps that is why we refrain from asking patients in psychiatry when you have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric file mentions that my mother psychiatrist explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
So this is an objective symptom.
When I say it's sniff, it's a never-important subjective testimony.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of the new treatments) is useless in a scientific manner?
What do you base the research on, then?
On fantasies?
Do you put at the same level of fanciful theories and facts (giving verifiable testimony)?
"Resilience": the word can adored by the grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who think of themselves as great psychologists after reading D'ansembourg.
"Jim: There's a lot of meaningless buzzwords in the psychiatrists.
Cyrulnik has made us the result of “resilience”.
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he has tinkered with us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could save us all from Farage and company??
Doesn't that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to bring the Sentinels out of the air...
And why?
It was a great series and it looks like those who come out of it are aware of it.
So let us leave our salvation to the omnipotent who can work miracles.
But how are they going to make children catch?
The only solution that comes to mind is the pee-poe humor, which would kill the show.
It was already a children's show.
The children were hanging on.
Ah, because it's a children's show?
The UKIP is working for the Mysterons.
So keep your Team America.
Still in Supermarionation?
It won't be the same if you don't see the sons and the animation is well done. :-)
I can't wait to see this (albeit an adult), but I hope it will give the idea of a chain to rebroadcast the old ones.
The series has almost never stopped being aired here in Australia; it's been at least 40 years since we have an hour-long episode on Saturdays and Sundays at 6 a.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it has been on one of the second-order commercial channels and can still be seen at these times.
And in addition, half-hour episodes now pass at 05:30, Monday to Friday.
Okay, I'm probably a "sad" 60-year-old guy, but I don't watch this show every day.
There is no "Temple Mountain" in or under the Esparayard Mosque.
Radical zionists have invented this to give political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all the Israeli excavations below and around the esplanade mosque for several decades have been unable to find anything.
The temple mount if it exists it is elsewhere.
Maybe in Argentine??
This mountain is not wanted for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the mosque plaza was built.
Its summit, or dome of the Rock, protrudes in the middle of the Omar Mosque.
For Muslims, Muhammad has climbed to heaven from this rock.
For Jews, it was Mount Moriah, where Abraham failed to sacrifice his son Isaac.
As long as it was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, it is good to recall it regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the plan to 2 states, and scuttled it continuously).
It is also good to show how peaceful the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Can God recognize his own?
The shortest of the Jewish jokes: "God be praised."
To boast about tourism in Israel, we are often shown young naive people half-naked, alanguia on the beach.
Reality is, as usual, very different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scared anyway.
And this picture is a magnificent piece of propaganda.
It is a pity that the Reuters photographer has not photographed the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to return to the Temple Mount and who prefer to shoot the Jewish faithful below, praying to the Lamenting Wall.
"Mat, if this picture bothers you, it's right, it's not the newspaper, it's not the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she conveys that we have to condemn.
This system is not tenable and will end in tears.
The only way to end this system is revolution.
Since the economy seems to be spinning, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have managed to convince their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given ever greater wages to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not tenable, but it will only change in this country when workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of moaning and moaning when someone else goes on strike, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that people are not just being snucked up with impunity.
Unless we give up democracy, in which case it is tenable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like, for example, China and India.
All of this cannot be done well.
It was because we were in a democracy that it had.
Did you vote for TTIP?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people by bypassing national governments through secret courts.
It sounds incredible, but that's exactly what the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is about.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people about the unimaginable damage that this agreement will have on our lives.
It's only recently that we're starting to talk about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement so Look at these links and you'll understand what's being negotiated behind your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat and tears"?
This is having an excellent fallout, while digital money has no reason to fall, let alone grow on trees.
The next weakest link is likely to be the car market.
This gentleman is right, in the XVIII there were trade unions in all the regiments
In the very Catholic French armed, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Leave that way (finally, her officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe himself to be the safe of the eternal values of France, and she will fight and close her mouth.
And then with the country's decline, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of nation, having this little relic, is comforting.
Even if for her, it's getting more and more uncomfortable...
They still miss you the sindicate of married men, the belibaires, the married women, the belibaires, the lost dogs and I don't know what else
If you don't write French properly, I'm a union.
You're warned, it'll be your fault.
In order to defend the interests of the categories, the protected professions with trade unions are already sufficiently affected, which has created a break with other citizens.
A staff member is urged not to laugh at fear of risk.
One can well imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or without the right to strike, as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise, disaster insured.
And with the carts being prepared, the government welcomes this.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since this is the subject here commented...
Let us delete "through its delegates" in the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker shall participate in the collective determination of working conditions and in the management of undertakings."
This is absolutely essential with the invasion of informational power.
And yet you've opened, probably read and comment, and comment on an article specifically called "The Great British Bake Off Review." ??????
Wait, the section was there, any emptiness.
I thought we had to start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding that I watched, and I can tell you that some have been well seasoned.
In the Joffrey wedding episode, we have one of the best moments (like deceptive: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, pie mmmh . . .
Game of Thrones.
I love GBBO.
This is the second time in a row that, strangely, the show ends with a worst baker's victory; no one has done the kind of "boom, here's my fucking cake now buffy it and bow to your master."
Maybe the extra pressure from friends and parents outside eventually had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all these outsiders were kept out of the way.
And there is also the idea of "playing security, there's always next week" that disappears the last week.
I like cooking, but I can't imagine myself inflicting this.
I am grateful to those who do it and thus offer us great entertainment and pushes us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015
I agree, the last challenge of last year, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to do them and they had to tinker with one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to decide, I don't know how they could pick a winner.
At Luis's, the only real flaw they could find was the dry base (though I agree with Hollywood that green icing on Richard's mill didn't make envy, anyway Richard had already lost at that time).
I have to say that several challenges in this series seem a little artificial because of the time available.
There's also cancer lurking, with solar gusts of wind.
Decidedly, everything is happening to us right now.
A bad time to spend on humanity, we hope so.
You confuse solar wind with ultraviolet rays.
UV is blocked mainly by the ozone layer, which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there wouldn't be enough solar wind to "pull" the ozone from the stratosphere.
There would even be more, and therefore less UV and “cancer”.
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a bunch of useful functions that you don't suspect.
If we confine ourselves to humans, they have the advantage of allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to heat us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic UVCs and allows UVAs and most UVBs to pass through.
You know that you do not have to be condescending and to regard your interlocutor as a party when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor clarification that was implied in the commentary, which itself intended to show pedagogy.
Without saying that I am accustomed to melanoma, UV only ACCELD its development.
They don't PROVOQUED it.
Proof of this is that not all people tanned necessarily have melanoma.
Or, when a toubib tells you that you have to avoid the sun and live in the depths of a cellar, it is better not to listen because UV is necessary for every human.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And, more importantly, can we move it to the mixer?
or switch it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the purpose for which it is intended.
I think the army would need something more resilient and therefore not yet adopted the iPhone6 as front-line communications equipment.
But for us,
It's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied.
Except for a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
We make this joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth joke on the fold that I read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production line and you can see how it could come back to it.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been installed correctly and is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don't know how they do this stuff at all.
But, would they put test software on everyone?
Photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of a FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
ah the article for bobo par excellence.
We want inexpensive products and we are surprised that the industrialists produce in 'industrial' We put forward super u but all the brands and meme the petty trade are concerned.
But to answer your post, if it's possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After everyone is free to put their priorities where they hear them.
For me, food is one of them.
Go without grudges, I kiss you
We call bobos, or better boofylos, people who see the world through ideological “software” that causes them to disconnect from reality.
This is total thought-reason unbundling.
They are experts in posturing, for example, claim to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartufery, joining the left-caviar, from which they sometimes come from, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our citizens cannot support this mixture of heavy ideology and tartufery, so do not be surprised to often encounter criticism of them.
Wow, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theorization as well as for all the associated details (airplane, shower...).
I would like to be part of it, but I do not find myself there.
The concept is not so complicated.
Boboecolos are one-piece.
Did you understand the concept of the left-caviar?
Well, you're able to understand the concept of boboecoon.
It is the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were to turn to the ecologists at all.
The boboeocello is one of them, but is only the most visible segment of the ecologists, because it is the one that infests the media.
This is a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, nobody wants to look this giraffe in the face.
It's so badly made that it vaguely looks like a female nude.
Shh, you're next to the plate.
You have to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the stunning beauty of truth of this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to comment since you have not spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic ability.
That's "art."
No, it's a pig.
The fact that Emin can't draw
This is not really a fact.
Rather, it is an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can enjoy are realistic reproductions of dogs smoking while playing billiards.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in that case.
Drawing is much more than just representing the real.
If you're just looking for that, a camera will do.
The author also speaks of Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the picture speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing that you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still savings: horseback riding activities, the number of horses in the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
The honesty obliges to say that France is shrinking, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastically, starting with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operational without the support, it quickly finds its limits.
A singular approach, at a time when we are seeing the weaknesses, the shortcomings of our defence tool, particularly in the Sahel.
This is a bad blow for the local authorities concerned, which are losing a scale of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuary?
That's what I was saying, look elsewhere where to save money, but certainly not at home, it's really not possible...
That's exactly what you're proposing to do, look elsewhere where the gobegology is certain.
Let all those who have certainly rubbed should the military thing dare to come and say here, with their eyes in their eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting with laughter...
Applying the same potion to the entire civil service and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really retold: look at the inflation of public jobs in other ministries and you'll understand why Defense can be a little loaded.
Well yes, the economies that everyone agrees that we have to do them, must it be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls groan at murder when it happens at home, poor darlings.
It should be done, but above all that it does not fall on me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go.
How will the closure of the Val de Grace weaken our defence tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, history is repeated at every post closure, maternity, hospital and barracks.
But everyone is for economies of course.
It's weird, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and doesn't rejoice at the savings in public spending.
This article is really the most mind-boggling thing I've ever read.
That embarrassing moment when the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It's depression to scroll through her Facebook feed and see that 80 percent of his friends started their status with the phrase "This embarrassing moment."
I think they're going to make a movie out of it.
He will surely rely on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex on the bus on his way to work and only realizes that his skirt has entered his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely stupid.
Not really, in my opinion, the author is taking the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and clench our teeth.
I'm sure if you're a Kate Bush fan, the announcement of his return to the stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who will be entitled?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
Not having a computer.
God, I need to see this movie before I die.
I can't believe how much this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read.
Charlie has really just demonstrated that he is at the top of the cosmic universe of satirical journalism.
I fall back in over.
It is absolutely essential that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the enlightenment and discover the incredible fulgurance and unsurpassable genius that springs from Mr. Brooker as a divine gleam.
God, it was really sucked.
Especially if they are neither women nor transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development in democracies: the rise of regional policies and effective associative initiatives.
Until further notice, we have the right to save our planet by States that play tartuffs at every meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, as citizens, to take matters into our own hands.
With the Commissioner they planted with energy, all these fine recommendations skyrocketed ....
Translate: Wind turbines and solar farms are the Roundabouts of tomorrow.
All financed by the tributor.
Please stop this pro-nuclear discourse.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the sector is not fully mastered, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, provided, of course, that our consumption is drastically reduced.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France is not concerned at all.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity through renewable wind or PV is already more GHGs on the other steps and, above all, gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for the intermittence.
Replacing nuclear power with wind or PV renewable energy would run counter to the fight against CO2.
Christial I don't insult you I'm a state doctor in physical science 1981, and I've done research in nuclear physics, I challenge you to prove the opposite of what I said.
For what I did not say, it was you who gave me ideas I did not say anything about Germany, you did not answer what I said and, as all the people on the right to demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I also quote the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: Germany’s current renewable energy programme is an uneconomical and inefficient way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you don't count uranium extraction and construction and if you don't count water vapour, gas, minus any effect, that Co2 is a reminder of two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant goes from water and a little bit into river water.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a "South Asian giant"...
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
I am not surprised, most Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India a giant of South Asia.
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players are participating, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would just open a box of Pandora full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was surprisingly interesting, with Kolkata's Athletico winning 3–0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions that India spends on IPL cricket and now football, how could we ever compete with our "nose neighbors"...
The race to the low-cost launch vehicle is paid for cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect only manifests itself with too cold helium.
We may therefore not be in a lack of design, but of implementation . . .
Unlike arianespace, which is a private company, it seems that soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer.
Maybe they're going to pay for the satellites into frigates that knows.
This is all the more unfortunate because many media are resuming the headlines in a loop – and many readers only take up these titles.
All in all, this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
I totally agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly questions the project when it is only a caster problem.
