It&#39;s a story about how we know what we know.
This is a story about this woman Natalia Rybczynski.
She&#39;s a paleobiologist, which means she specializes in digging up old dead stuff.
Natalia Rybczynski: Yes, sometimes I have been called “Dr Things Dead”.
Latif Nasser: I think she&#39;s interesting because of where she works, way above the Arctic Circle in the remote tundra of Canada.
One summer day in 2006, she was at a dig site called Fyles Leaf Bed, which is less than 10 degrees latitude from the magnetic north pole.
NR: Honestly, it doesn&#39;t look exciting, because it was a day of walking with a backpack, a GPS and a notebook, and we were picking up everything that could be a fossil.
LN: And at some point, she noticed something.
NR: Rusty, rust-red in color, as big as the palm of my hand.
He was just laying on the ground.
LN: And at first she thought it was just a splinter, like the ones found at the Fyles Leaf Bed before- bits of prehistoric plants.
But that night, back at camp,...
NR: ...I take out a magnifying glass, take a closer look and realize that it doesn&#39;t have the growth rings of a tree.
It may be his conservation, but it really looks like...
bone.
LN: So, over the next four years, she repeatedly returned to this place, and in the end she collected 30 fragments of the same bone, most of them very small.
NR: It&#39;s not that much. It comes in a small plastic bag.
LN: And she tried to put them together like a puzzle.
But it was stimulating.
NR: It&#39;s all broken into so many little pieces, I try with sand and putty, but to no avail.
So finally, we used a 3D surface scanner.
NL: Ooh! NR: Yes, exactly.
LN: But it was easier to do it virtually.
NR: It&#39;s a bit magical when everything comes together.
LN: How did you know it was good, that they were put together properly?
Would it have been possible to assemble them differently to have a parakeet or something else?
NR: Uh, no. No, it could only be that.
LN: She discovered that what she had was a tibia, a leg bone, and specifically, the bone of a cloven-hoofed mammal, so something like a cow or a sheep.
But it couldn&#39;t be one of those.
It was just too big.
NR: The size of this thing was huge. It is a very large animal.
LN: So what animal could it be?
In the impasse, she showed one of the fragments to her colleagues in Colorado, and they had an idea.
NR: We took a saw, and we just nicked the edge, and there was this very interesting smell coming out of it.
LN: It smelled like scorched flesh.
It was a smell Natalia recognized after cutting up quite a few skulls in her disgusting anatomy lab: collagen.
Collagen is what gives our bones their structure.
And in general, after so many years, it breaks down.
But in this case, the Arctic had acted as a natural freezer and kept it there.
Then, a year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol, and she saw that a colleague of hers, Mike Buckley, was presenting a new method called &quot;collagen fingerprinting.&quot;
It turns out that all species have slightly different collagen structures, so if you have the collagen profile of an unknown bone, you can compare it to that of known species, and, who knows, maybe that &#39;they correspond.
So she sent him one of the fragments, via FedEx.
NR: Yes, we wanted to follow him. It was quite important
LN: He studied it, and he compared it to 37 known modern mammal species.
And he found a match.
It turns out that the 3.5 million year old bone that Natalia unearthed from the High Arctic belonged to...
a camel.
NR: And I was like, “That&#39;s great -- if that&#39;s true. »
LN: They tested several fragments and they had the same result each time.
However, based on the size of the bone they found, this camel appeared to be 30% larger than modern camels.
So this camel would have been almost 2.80 meters tall, and weighed almost a ton.
And yes.
Natalia had found a giant arctic camel.
Well, when you hear the word “camel”, what should come to mind is one of those, the Bactrian camel of East and Central Asia.
But you may have in mind a postcard image like this, the dromedary, the typical animal of the desert -- which lives in the sand of hot places, like the Middle East or the Sahara, with a big bump on his back where he stores water for his treks, and with big, wide feet that help him climb sand dunes.
So how do you explain that one of them ended up in the High Arctic?
In fact, scientists have known for a long time, even before Natalia&#39;s discovery, that camels are originally American.
They started here.
For 40 of the 45 million years since camels have existed, you could only find them in North America, about 20 different species, maybe more.
If we aligned them all, would we see any differences?
NR: Yes, the bodies will have different sizes.
You&#39;re going to have some with very long necks, which will actually be like giraffes.
LN: Some had mouths, like crocodiles.
NR: The most primitive would have been very small, almost like rabbits.
NL: What? Rabbit-sized camels?
NR: The oldest.
So probably you wouldn&#39;t recognize them.
LN: Damn, I want a rabbit-camel.
NR: I know, that would be awesome.
LN: And three to seven million years ago, a branch of camels came down to South America, where they became llamas and alpacas, and another branch crossed the Bering tongue of land to Asia and Africa.
And at the end of the last Ice Age, North American camels went extinct.
So the scientists already knew all of this, but it doesn&#39;t really explain why Natalia found one so far north.
Because, temperature-wise, it&#39;s the exact opposite of the Sahara.
To be frank, 3.5 million years ago, the average temperature was 22°C warmer than today.
So there would have been a boreal forest, more like the Yukon or Siberia today.
But still, they would have had winters that lasted 6 months during which the ponds were frozen.
There would have been blizzards.
There would have been 24-hour days completely shrouded in darkness.
So how... How?
How is it possible that one of these Sahara superstars could survive in this arctic environment?
Natalia and her colleagues think they have an answer.
And it&#39;s pretty awesome.
What if the characteristics that make camels so well adapted to places like the Sahara actually evolved to help them withstand winter?
What if those broad feet were made, not for walking on sand, but in snow, like a pair of snowshoes?
What if this hump -- which, by the way, big news for me, contains no water, but fat -- was there to help the camel endure those six-month winters, when food is scarce?
And then, only later, after crossing the land bridge, did he use these features to adapt them to the hot deserts?
For example, the hump can be useful to camels for desert climates because having all their fat in one place, like a backpack of fat, means they don&#39;t have that insulating layer on the rest of the body. body.
So the heat dissipates more easily.
It&#39;s this crazy idea that the attributes of the camel that we believe prove its desert nature may actually be evidence of its arctic past.
So I&#39;m not the first to tell this story.
Some have talked about it to embellish evolutionary biology or to give some insight into the future of climate change.
But I love him for any other reason.
For me, it&#39;s a story about us, how we see the world and how it&#39;s changing.
I have a history degree.
And I learned that actually a lot of scientists are also historians.
They give meaning to the past.
They tell the story of our universe, of our planet, of life on it.
And as a historian, you start with a certain idea of how history unfolds.
NR: We make up stories and that&#39;s it, like the camel in the desert.
It&#39;s a great story! She sticks well to the idea.
They have apparently always lived there.
LN: But at any time, we can discover a very small piece of evidence.
We can learn a little trick that will force us to review everything we thought we knew.
For example, in this case, there&#39;s a scientist who finds this shard thinking it&#39;s a piece of wood, and because of that, science has a totally new and really counter-intuitive theory that shows why this creature, seeming to come out of Dr. Seuss&#39; drawings, is as she is.
And for me, it completely changed the way I see the camel.
He went from being this ridiculous creature only adapted to a specific environment, to this great traveler who has just arrived in the Sahara, and who could theoretically arrive anywhere.
Here is Azuri.
Azuri, hi, how are you?
Ok, here, I have this for you.
Azuri is on vacation, usually he is at his concerts at Radio City Music Hall.
It&#39;s not even a joke.
Anyway -- Azuri is here as living proof, to remind us that our world&#39;s history is dynamic.
Only our will can help us readjust it, reinvent it.
Right, Azuri?
And really, we&#39;re all one step away from seeing the world differently.
Thank you so much.
Today&#39;s computers are so amazing that you don&#39;t realize how bad they are.
Today I would like to talk to you about this problem and how we can solve it with neuroscience.
First, I&#39;d like to take you back to Harlem on a freezing night in 2011 that left a deep impression on me.
I was sitting at a bar not far from Columbia University, where I was studying computer science and neuroscience, and was deep in conversation with another student about the ability of holograms to one day replace computers.
As we got to the best part of the conversation, of course, her phone turned on.
He takes it out, looks at it and starts typing something.
Then he forces his eyes back on me and he says, “Go on. I&#39;m listening to you. »
But of course, his eyes were missing, and the moment had passed.
Meanwhile, in that bar, I saw another student holding his phone, this time towards a group.
He was scrolling through pictures on Instagram, and these kids were laughing hysterically.
This dichotomy between my feeling of unease and the joy they felt about the same technology made me wonder.
The more I thought about it, the more I realized that the problem here was clearly not digital information, it was just the position of use that separated me from my friend and brought these kids together.
They were connected around something just like our ancestors who improved their social skills by telling stories around the campfire.
I think that&#39;s exactly what the tools should do.
Extend our bodies.
I think computers today do the opposite.
Whether you&#39;re emailing your wife, composing a symphony, or consoling a friend, you do it pretty much the same way.
You&#39;re hunched over these rectangles, tapping on buttons, menus and more rectangles.
I think it&#39;s the wrong way. I think we can start using a more natural machine.
We should use machines that bring our work back into this world.
Machines that use the principles of neuroscience to extend our senses, not go against them.
It turns out that I actually have such a machine.
It&#39;s called Meta 2.
Let&#39;s test it!
In front of me, I can see an audience, and I can see my hands.
And in three, two, one, we&#39;re going to see an immersive hologram appear, a very realistic hologram appear in front of me, from the glasses I&#39;m wearing.
Of course, it could be something we buy or learn, and I can use my hands to finely move it.
I think Iron Man would be proud.
We will come back to this a little later.
Now if you&#39;re like me, your mind is already in shock at the possibilities we have with this type of technology, let&#39;s look at some of them.
My mother is an architect, so naturally the first thing I thought of was to draw a 3D building instead of using these 2D plans.
There, she touches graphics and selects interior decor.
Everything was filmed with a GoPro with our own glasses.
This next case is really special to me, it&#39;s Professor Adam Gazzaley&#39;s Brain Glasses Project, provided by UCSF.
As a student of neuroscience, I will always fantasize about being able to learn and memorize these complex brain structures with an actual machine, I could touch and play with these different brain structures.
What you&#39;re seeing now is called augmented reality, but to me it&#39;s part of a much bigger story — a story about how we begin to expand our bodies through digital objects, rather than reverse.
Now...
I think that in the next few years, humanity will experience a change.
We&#39;re going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world.
Imagine for a moment what that would mean for storytellers, painters, brain surgeons, interior designers, and perhaps all of us here today.
And what we need to do as a community is try and make the effort to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that extends the human experience, rather than gamifying our reality. or clutter it with digital information.
This is what really excites me.
Now I want to tell you a little secret.
In about five years — it&#39;s not the smallest device — in about five years they&#39;ll all look like strips of glass on our eyes that are projecting holograms.
Since we don&#39;t care much about the phone we buy for its technical characteristics - we buy it for the operating system - as a neuroscientist, I have always dreamed of creating &quot;the iOS of the mind&quot;, If you want.
It&#39;s very, very important to get it right, because we could live in these things for at least as long as we spend with the Windows UI.
And I don&#39;t know about you, but living inside Windows scares me.
To isolate the most intuitive interface from infinity, we use neuroscience to create our design principles, rather than a bunch of designers arguing in a meeting.
The principle that we all rely on is what is called the &quot;Neural Path of Least Resistance.&quot; »
Each time, we try to connect the iOS of our brain with our brain according to, for the very first time, our conditions.
In other words, we are trying to create a computer with no learning curve.
We&#39;re building a system you&#39;ve always known how to use.
Here is the first of the three principles that we employ in this brand new user experience.
First, you are the operating system.
Classic file systems are complex and abstract, requiring extra steps from your brain to decode them.
We thwart the Neural Path of Lowest Resistance.
Meanwhile, in augmented reality, you place your holographic TED sign right there, and your holographic email on the other side of the desk, and your evolved spatial memory picks them up.
You could put your holographic Tesla that you buy — or whatever model my legal team told me to put.
Perfect. Your brain knows exactly how to bring it back.
We call the second interface principle “Touch to see”.
What do babies do when they see something that attracts attention?
They try to reach him, to touch him.
This is exactly the way the natural machine should work.
It turns out that the visual system gets a key boost from a sense called proprioception — it&#39;s the sense of our body&#39;s limbs in space.
By directly touching our work, we will not only have better control over it, but we will also better understand it.
And so, touch to see.
But that&#39;s not enough to feel things.
We are inherently social primates.
This brings me to our third principle, the holographic campfire of our first story.
Our mirror neuron system suggests that we can connect better with each other and with our work if we can see our faces and hands in 3D.
So if you look at the video behind me, you can see two Meta users playing with the same hologram, making eye contact, connected around that object, instead of being distracted by external devices.
Let&#39;s go ahead and try again with neuroscience in mind.
Again, our favorite interface, the iOS of the mind.
I&#39;m now going to go one step further and grab this pair of glasses and leave it here by the desk.
I am with you, right now we are connected.
My spatial memory kicked in, and I can grab it and put it back here, remembering that I&#39;m the operating system.
And my proprioception is on, and I can go on and blast these glasses into thousands of pieces and touch the sensor that&#39;s scanning my hand.
But that&#39;s not enough to see the objects alone, in a second co-founder Ray will be calling in 3D -- Ray?
Hi Ray, how are you?
I can see this person entirely in front of me in 3D.
And it&#39;s pretty realistic.
THANKS.
My mirror neuron system suggests this will replace telephones shortly.
Ray, how are you?
Ray: Alright. We are live today.
MG: Ray, give the audience a gift from the holographic brain we saw earlier.
This will not only replace phones, but it will also change the way we collaborate.
Thank you so much.
Thanks, Ray.
Ray: You&#39;re welcome.
MG: Well, here&#39;s the message I discovered in a bar in 2011: the future of computers isn&#39;t locked inside one of these screens.
He is right there, in us.
If there is only one idea I can give today, it is that the natural machine is not the fruit of the future, it is right here in 2016.
That&#39;s why all of us at Meta, including administrative staff, executives, designers, engineers -- before TED2017, we&#39;re all going to be trashing our external monitors and replacing them with machines that are truly and profoundly more natural.
Thank you so much.
It&#39;s very nice thank you.
Thank you all.
Chris Anderson: Okay, explain something to me, because there have been few demonstrations of augmented reality in the last year or earlier here.
And there is sometimes a debate among technologists as to whether we really see the real object on the screen.
It&#39;s a field of vision problem. In a way, the technology shows a wider view than what you should see while wearing the glasses.
Have we seen real life?
MG: Absolutely real life.
And not only that, we have taken other measures to film with a GoPro with the real lenses, the various videos broadcast.
We want to try to simulate the experience of the world we see through the glasses, and not cut any passages.
CA: Thank you very much for this presentation.
MG: Thank you very much, it was a pleasure.
I come from one of the most liberal, tolerant, progressive places in the United States: Seattle, Washington.
I grew up with a family of great Seattelites.
My mom was an artist, my dad a college professor, and I&#39;m grateful for my childhood because I was always completely comfortable living my life as I saw fit.
In fact, I took a path that was not what my parents had imagined.
At 19, I dropped out of college -- dropped out, fired, splitting my hair.
I went on tour as a professional horn player, which was my lifelong dream.
I played chamber music across the United States and Europe, I was on tour for 2 years with a great jazz player: Charlie Bird.
Approaching my 30s, I ended up as a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra.
What a life !
My parents never complained.
They supported me throughout.
It was not their dream.
They would tell their neighbors and friends, “Our son is taking a decade off. »
And -- There was, however, an awkward conversation about my lifestyle that I&#39;d like to tell you about.
I was 27 years old, I had returned from Barcelona, I was at my parents&#39; house for Christmas, I was preparing dinner with my mother and we were alone in the kitchen.
And she was silent, too silent.
Something was wrong.
I said, &quot;Mom, what are you thinking? »
She said, “Your father and I are worried about you. »
I said what ? What could it be?
And she said, “I want you to be completely honest: did you vote Republican? »
Actually, I wasn&#39;t very political, I was just a horn player.
I had an epiphany, they perceived it and it caused confusion.
I had become an enthusiast of capitalism and I want to explain to you what it is.
It grew out of my lifelong interest in, believe it or not, poverty.
When I was a kid, growing up in Seattle, I remember the first time I saw real poverty.
We were a lower-middle-class family, but of course that&#39;s not real poverty.
It is even far from it.
The first time I saw poverty and its face, I was 6 or 7 years old, in the early 70s.
And, like many of you, it was a prosaic and banal example.
It was a photograph in National Geographic of a child my age in East Africa, there were flies on his face and a distended belly.
He wasn&#39;t going to make it, I knew it and I was helpless.
Some of you remember this image, not exactly this one, but a similar one.
She revealed squalor to the West.
This vision haunted me as I grew up, went to school, dropped out, did other things, and started a family.
And I wondered what happened to that child
or others like him all over the world.
I studied, even though I was not in university, I was looking for an answer: what happened to the poorest people in the world?
Was it getting worse, getting better? What ?
I found the answer and it changed my life, and I want to share it with you.
See -- most Americans believe poverty has gotten worse since our childhood since they saw this photo.
Ask Americans how world poverty has changed, 70% will say world hunger has gotten worse since the early 1970s.
But here is the truth.
Here is the epiphany that changed my way of thinking.
Between the 1970s and today, the percentage of the world&#39;s population living in starvation, living on less than a dollar a day, adjusted for inflation, this percentage has dropped by 80%.
There has been an 80% decrease in the most severe global poverty since I was a child.
And I didn&#39;t even know it.
This, my friends, is a miracle.
We must celebrate it.
It&#39;s the greatest anti-poverty success story in human history, and it&#39;s happening in our lifetime.
When I learned of this, I asked: what did this, made this possible?
Because if you don&#39;t know why, you can&#39;t do it again.
If you want to do it again and lift the next two billion out of poverty, because that&#39;s what we&#39;re talking about: since I was a kid, two billion of those, our brothers and sisters, have come out of poverty.
I want the next two billion, so I need to know why.
I searched for an answer.
She wasn&#39;t political, because I didn&#39;t care.
I always don&#39;t care.
I wanted the best response from mainstream left, right, and center economists.
There she is.
Here are the reasons.
These are the five reasons two billion of our brothers and sisters have been lifted out of poverty since I was a child.
The first: globalization.
The second: free trade.
The third: economic rights.
The fourth: the rule of law.
The fifth: entrepreneurship.
It was the free enterprise system spreading around the world after 1970 that did this.
I am not naive.
I know free enterprise isn&#39;t perfect, and free enterprise alone isn&#39;t enough to build a better world.
But she&#39;s great.
And it goes beyond politics.
This is what I learned, my epiphany.
Capitalism is not just about accumulation.
Its main asset is aspiration, which is what a lot of people are talking about on this stage, the aspiration that comes from the dreams embodied in the free enterprise system.
We need to share it with more people.
I want to tell you about a second epiphany which is linked to the first and which can bring us progress, not only in the world but also at home.
The best quote I&#39;ve heard to sum up the thoughts I just mentioned for lifting people out of poverty is this: “Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history.
They lifted billions of people out of poverty. »
Who said that?
Looks like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
It&#39;s wrong.
President Barack Obama said so.
Why do I know it by heart?
Because he was speaking to me.
It&#39;s crazy.
And I said, “Hallelujah! »
But more than that, I said, “What an opportunity. »
Do you know what I was thinking?
I was at an event on this topic at Georgetown University in May 2015.
And I thought that was the solution to America&#39;s biggest problem today. What is it?
It is to come together around these ideas, liberal and conservative, to help those who need it most.
Needless to say, we are in crisis, in America and in many politically polarized countries around the world.
It has reached a critical crisis level.
It&#39;s unpleasant. It is not fair.
Last year there was an article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which is one of the most prestigious scientific journals in the West.
It was a 2014 article on the asymmetry of political motivations.
Who is it ? Psychologists call this the phenomenon of assuming that your ideology is based on love but your opponent&#39;s ideology is based on hate.
This is common in a global conflict.
You expect, for example, to see it between Palestinians and Israelis.
What the authors of this article discovered is that today in America, a majority of Republicans and Democrats suffer from asymmetry of political motivations.
Today, a majority of politically active people think they are motivated by love but the other party is motivated by hate.
Think about it. Think about it.
Most people say, &quot;My ideology is based on basic benevolence, I want to help people, but others are demonic and mean me harm.&quot; »
Society cannot progress when there is this type of asymmetry.
It&#39;s impossible.
How to solve this?
First, let&#39;s be honest: there are differences.
Let&#39;s not minimize the differences. That would be naive.
There is a lot of research on this.
A veteran of the TED scene is my friend Jonathan Haidt.
He is a professor of psychology at New York University.
He works on the ideology, values and morals of different people to see their differences.
He has, for example, shown us that conservatives and liberals have a different emphasis on what seems important to them.
For example, Jon Haidt showed that liberals care 59% more about poverty than about economic freedom.
And conservatives care 28% more about economic freedom than poverty.
Irreconcilable differences?
We will never come together. Fake.
Our strength lies in diversity.
Remember what lifted us out of poverty.
It was an obsession with poverty accompanied by the method of economic freedom spreading around the world.
We need others, in other words, if we are to help people and lift the next two billion out of poverty.
There is no other solution.
How are we going to do it?
It&#39;s delicate.
We must innovate in our way of thinking.
Many points are on stage.
Social entrepreneurship. Yeah. Absolutely. Phenomenal.
We need to invest abroad in a sustainable, responsible, ethical and moral way. Yes. Yes.
But what do we really need?
Of a flexible ideology,
less predictable.
No ?
Do you ever feel like your ideology becomes predictable?
Almost conventional?
Don&#39;t you feel like you always listen to people who agree with you?
Why is it dangerous?
Because when we talk about the economy in this country, on the right, the conservatives, you always talk about taxes, regulations, big government.
And on the left, liberals, you always talk about income inequality.
These are important things, very important for me and for you.
But when it comes to helping people who are starving and need us, they are distractions.
We need to rally around the best ways to alleviate poverty using the best tools at our disposal, that only comes when Conservatives recognize they need Liberals and their obsession with poverty, and Liberals need Conservatives and their obsession with the free market.
It is in this diversity that lies the future strength of this country, if we choose it.
How are we going to do it? How are we going to do it together?
I need a plan of action, not just for you but for me.
Number one. First point: it is not enough to tolerate people who do not agree.
It is not enough.
Let&#39;s remember that we need people who disagree, because there are people who need all of us, who are still waiting for these tools.
What are you going to do ? How are you going to express it?
Where does it start? It starts here.
In this room, we are all lucky.
Lucky to have people listening to us.
Lucky to thrive. Lucky to lead.
When people hear us, with the unpredictable ideology, maybe they will listen to us.
Progress may begin there.
This is the first point. The second.
Deuzio: I ask you and I ask myself specifically to be the person who blurs the line, who is ambiguous, difficult to classify.
If you&#39;re a conservative, be a conservative who always talks about poverty and the moral obligation to be a warrior for the poor.
If you&#39;re a liberal, be a liberal who always talks about the beauty of free markets, used responsibly, to solve our problems.
If we do this, we get two things.
One: We start working for the next billions and being the solution we have seen in the past and need in the future. We get that.
And the second thing is that we might be able to take the dreadful damn ideological war that we are suffering in this country and turn it into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
And then maybe, maybe, we&#39;ll realize that our big differences aren&#39;t that big after all.
THANKS.
In college, I majored in Political Science so I had to write a lot of essays.
When a normal student writes an essay, he spreads out the work a bit like this.
You know... You might start out slow, but you write a little during the first week and coupled with more productive days, in the end, it&#39;s all done and everyone keeps their cool.
And I would like to do it like that.
That would be the goal. Everything would be prepared. But the essay arrives and so, I do this.
And it&#39;s like that for every essay.
Then came my 90-page senior thesis, a document you&#39;re supposed to work on for a year.
I knew that for such a dissertation, my usual pace was not viable.
So I planned everything out, and I decided that I had to come up with something like this.
The year was going to unfold like this.
So I was going to start light, and I was going to increase in the middle months, and at the end, I was going to put the top gear, like a small staircase.
Climbing stairs, where is the difficulty?
It&#39;s not much, is it?
But then a funny thing happened.
Those first few months?
They came and went and I couldn&#39;t really work.
So we have a great revised plan.
And so... But then those middle months come and I didn&#39;t really write a word, so here we were.
Then two months turns into a month, which turns into two weeks.
And one day, I wake up with three days to go, still haven&#39;t written a word. So I did the only thing I could: I wrote 90 pages in 72 hours, with not one, but two sleepless nights. Humans aren&#39;t made for sleepless nights. I ran across campus, dove in slow motion, and delivered the essay just before the deadline.
I thought that was the end of it all.
But a week later, I received a phone call from the university.
And they say, “Tim Urban? »
And I said, “Yes. »
“We need to talk about your thesis. »
&quot; OK. »
And they say, &quot;It&#39;s the best we&#39;ve ever seen.&quot; »
It&#39;s not true.
It was a very, very bad thesis.
I just wanted to appreciate that one moment when you all thought, &quot;This guy is fantastic!&quot; »
No, she was very, very bad.
Today I am writing a blog.
I write the Wait But Why blog.
A few years ago, I decided to write about procrastination.
My behavior has always baffled the non-procrastinators around me. I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world what is going on in our head, why we are like this.
I had a hypothesis that procrastinators&#39; brains are actually different from other people&#39;s brains.
To test this, I found a lab with an MRI that allowed me to scan my brain and that of an avowed non-procrastinator, so I could compare them.
I brought them here to show you today.
I want you to look carefully to identify a difference.
I know if you&#39;re not a brain expert it&#39;s not that obvious, but give it a try.
So that&#39;s the brain of a non-procrastinator.
NOW...
here is my brain.
There is a difference.
Both brains have a Rational Decider in them, but the procrastinator brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.
What does this mean for the procrastinator?
It means that everything is fine until this happens.
So the Rational Decision Maker will make the rational decision to do something productive. But the Monkey doesn&#39;t like that plan, so he gets behind the wheel and he says, &quot;Actually, let&#39;s go read the whole Wikipedia page on the Nancy Kerrigan/Tonya Harding scandal, because I just remembered that.&quot; »
So... So we go to the fridge to see if there&#39;s anything new in the last 10 minutes.
After that, we embark on a YouTube spiral that begins with videos of Richard Feynman on magnets and ends much much later with interviews with Justin Bieber&#39;s mother.
“All this will take time so we won&#39;t have time to work today. Sorry ! »
What is happening here ?
The Monkey doesn&#39;t seem like someone you want behind the wheel.
He lives entirely in the present moment.
He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he is only interested in two things: convenience and fun.
In the animal world, it works fine.
If you&#39;re a dog and you spend your life doing easy and fun things, you&#39;re fantastic!
For the Monkey, humans are just another animal species.
You have to sleep, eat and create a new generation. This could work in prehistoric times.
But if you haven&#39;t noticed, we don&#39;t live in prehistory.
We live in an advanced civilization and the Monkey does not know what it is.
That&#39;s why we have another person in our brain, the Rational Decider who gives us the ability to do things that no other animal can do.
We can project ourselves into the future.
We can have an overview of the situation.
We can make long-term projects.
And he wants to take all of that into account.
And he wants us to just do what makes sense, here and now.
Sometimes it makes sense to do easy and fun things, like when you&#39;re having dinner or going to bed or enjoying some well-deserved time off.
There is an overlap. Sometimes they agree.
But other times, it makes a lot more sense to do things that are harder and less pleasant, for the sake of the bigger picture.
A conflict then arises.
For the procrastinator, this conflict tends to end the same way each time, leaving him to spend a lot of time in that orange zone, an easy and fun place, totally outside the Circle of Logic.
I call it the Dark Playground.
The Dark Gameboard is a place all of you procrastinators know very well.
It is the place where we have free time activities at times when they should not take place.
The fun you have on the Dark Gameboard is actually not fun, because it is unearned and the air is filled with guilt, fear, anxiety, self-loathing, all those feelings. good procrastinator.
In this situation, with the Monkey driving, the question is: how can the procrastinator get here in the blue zone, a less pleasant place, but where the really important things are done?
Turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel. Someone who always watches over him in his worst moments. Someone called the Panic Monster.
The Panic Monster sleeps most of the time but wakes up abruptly whenever a deadline gets too close or there is danger of public embarrassment, career disaster or some other terrible consequence.
And most importantly, it&#39;s the only thing the Monkey is afraid of.
It became very relevant to my life very recently, when the folks at TED contacted me six months ago and invited me to do a presentation.
Of course, I said yes.
It&#39;s always been my dream to do a presentation for TED.
Sentence in the past tense: But in the midst of all this excitement, the Rational Decision Maker seemed to have something else in mind.
He said, “Do you understand what you accepted?
Do you understand what will happen now?
We have to sit down and work on this now. »
And the Monkey said: &quot;Okay, but let&#39;s open Google Earth and look at southern India, like 50 m above the ground, and scroll the map for 2 and a half hours, until we reach northern India. countries, in order to better understand India. »
That&#39;s what we did that day.
As six months turns into four, then into two and into a month, the people at TED have decided to publish the names of the speakers.
I opened the website and saw my face looking at me.
And guess who woke up?
The Panic Monster begins to lose its mind, and within seconds there is anarchy throughout the system.
And the Monkey, remember, he&#39;s terrified of the Boom Panic Monster, there he is at the top of the tree!
And finally, the Rational Decision Maker can take the wheel and I can start working on the presentation.
The Panic Monster explains a lot of the rather insane behavior of the procrastinator, like how someone like me can spend two weeks unable to start a sentence of an essay and miraculously find the incredible work ethic to stay up all night to write 8 pages.
This whole situation, with these three characters, is the procrastinator system.
It&#39;s not pretty, but in the end it works.
This is what I decided to write about on the blog a few years ago.
When I did, I was amazed at the responses.
Thousands of emails came in, from all over the world, from all kinds of people, doing all kinds of things.
There were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and many, many PhD students.
They were all writing to say the same thing: “I have this problem too. »
But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the article and the heavy tone of these emails.
These people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives, what the Monkey had done to them.
I thought about it and said, if the procrastinator&#39;s system works, what&#39;s the problem?
Why do these people feel so bad?
Apparently, there are two types of procrastination.
The examples I gave today all have a deadline.
If there is a deadline, the effects of procrastination are contained in the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved.
But there is a second type that happens in non-deadline situations.
If you want a career as a freelancer, something in the arts or entrepreneurship, in the beginning there is no deadline to those things because nothing happens, until you start the hard work to gain momentum to get things moving. Lots of important things
outside of your career don&#39;t have a deadline, like your family, your health, exercising, working on your relationship, or getting out of it when it&#39;s not working out.
If the procrastinator&#39;s only mechanism for doing difficult things is the Panic Monster, that&#39;s a problem because in all these non-deadline situations, he&#39;s not there, he has no reason to wake up. The effects of procrastination are not contained and spread endlessly.
It&#39;s this kind of long-term procrastination that&#39;s much less visible and talked about much less than the funnier, short-term, deadline-based one.
We often suffer from it in silence and in private.
It can be the source of an enormous amount of pain and regret.
That was why these people were sending me those emails and why they felt so bad.
It&#39;s not that they crammed on certain projects.
Long-term procrastination has sometimes made them spectators of their own lives.
The frustration isn&#39;t that they can&#39;t achieve their dreams, it&#39;s that they can&#39;t even take the first step.
So I read those emails and kind of had an enlightenment: I don&#39;t think non-procrastinators exist.
It&#39;s true. I think you are all procrastinators.
You may not all be in a bad state like some of us... ...and some here may have a healthy relationship with deadlines. But remember: the Monkey&#39;s biggest trap comes when deadlines don&#39;t exist.
I want to show you one last thing.
I call it the Calendar of Life.
A box for each week for a life of 90 years.
That&#39;s not that many squares, especially when you&#39;ve already used quite a few.
I think we should all watch this calendar carefully.
We need to think about what we procrastinate on because everyone procrastinates on something in their life.
We must remain aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey.
It is a job for all of us.
There aren&#39;t that many boxes, so it&#39;s work that should probably start today.
In fact, maybe not today...
You know...
Soon.
THANKS.
There we were, souls and bodies packed into a church in Texas, on the last night of our lives.
Crammed into a room just like this, but with old wooden pews draped in worn red cloth, an organ to my left and a choir behind me, the baptismal font set into the wall behind it.
A piece like this, nonetheless.
With the same tremendous sense of suspense, the same deep hopes for salvation, the same sweat in the palms, and the same people deep down who aren&#39;t listening.
It was December 31, 1999, the night of Christ&#39;s second coming, and the end of the world as I knew it.
I had been 12 that year, and I had reached the age of responsibility.
After I stopped complaining about the unfairness of Jesus&#39; return when I had to be held accountable for my actions, I realized that it was better for me to clean up quickly.
I went to church as often as possible.
I watched the silence with the anxiety of someone watching the noise, trying to make sure the Lord hadn&#39;t played a trick on me and decided to come back sooner.
And in case He came back sooner, I had anticipated a back-up plan, reading the “Left Behind” series which was a hit at the time.
I found in their pages that if I wasn&#39;t taken away by midnight, I had another chance.
I just had to avoid taking the mark of the beast, fight demons, plagues and the Antichrist himself.
It would be difficult—but I knew I could do it.
But now was not the time to organize.
It was 11:50 p.m.
We had 10 minutes left, and my pastor called us to the altar, because he wanted to pray when midnight struck.
Each faction of the congregation took its place.
The choir remained in the choir, the deacons and their wives—or the Baptist Bourgeoisie, as I like to call them—seated themselves in the first row in front of the altar.
You see, in the United States, even the Second Coming of Christ has a VIP section.
And right behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie were the elderly—those men and women whose backs had once bent under the hot sun of the East Texas cotton fields, whose skins seemed marked with a smooth brown and noble, much like the East Texas clay, whose hopes and dreams of what would become of their lives outside of East Texas had at times been shattered,
deeper than their backs.
Yes, these men and women were the stars of the show for me.
They had waited all their lives for this moment, as their medieval predecessors had waited for the end of the world, and as my grandmother waited for the Oprah Winfrey Show on Channel 8 every day at 4 p.m.
And as she walked towards the altar, I hid behind her, because I was absolutely certain that my grandmother would go to Heaven.
And I thought if I squeezed her hand hard during prayer, I might go with her.
So I held his hand, and I closed my eyes, to listen, to wait.
The prayers became stronger.
And the cries in response to the call to prayer rose even higher.
The organ joined in the funereal atmosphere.
And the rising heat joined the sweat.
My hand tightens its embrace, so as not to be the abandoned one.
I closed my eyes tighter, so as not to see the separation of the wheat from the chaff.
Then a voice rose above us: “Amen. »
It was finished.
I looked at the clock.
It was past midnight.
I looked at the older believers, whose Savior had not come, who were too proud to show their disappointment, who had believed too much and for too long to doubt now.
But I was upset for them.
They had been duped, tricked, bamboozled, and I had let myself get carried away with them.
I had said their prayers, resisted temptation as best I could.
I hadn&#39;t dipped my head once, but twice, in those baptismal fonts that made you die.
I thought.
And now what?
I arrived home in time to turn on the television and watch Peter Jennings herald the new millennium as he strode around the world.
I was struck by the oddity of Jesus&#39; multiple returns, based on different time zones.
And I felt even more ridiculous—hurt, really.
But that night, I couldn&#39;t stop believing.
I just started to believe a new thing: that it was possible not to believe.
It was possible that the answers were wrong, that the questions themselves were wrong.
Now, where there had been a mountain of certainty, there was, rushing to its base, a source of doubt, a source that promised rivers.
I can trace the origin of the whole drama of my life, that night, in that church, when my Savior did not come for me; when what I really believed in turned out to be, if not a lie, at least not quite the truth.
Although some have prepared for the year 2000 in a very different way, I am convinced that you are here because a part of you has been doing the same thing as me since the beginning of this new century, since my mother left, my father did not return and my Lord refused to come.
And I reached out, to reach for something to believe in.
I held on when I arrived at Yale at 18, confident that my journey from Oak Cliff, Texas, was a chance to leave behind all the hardships I had known, the dreams and broken bodies I I had seen.
But when I found myself at home on winter vacation, face down, hands tied behind my back, and a burglar&#39;s gun to my head, I knew even the best education couldn&#39;t help me. save.
I held on when I came to Lehman Brothers as an intern in 2008.
So hopeful — that I called my family to let them know we would never be poor again.
But when I saw this temple of finance crumble before my eyes, I knew even the best job couldn&#39;t save me.
I held on when I arrived in Washington, as a young employee, who had heard a voice from Illinois saying, &quot;We&#39;ve waited a long time, but with this election, change has come to the United States. United. »
But when Congress ground to a halt, when the country tore itself apart, when hope and change sounded like a joke, I knew that even the political second coming couldn&#39;t save me.
I had knelt faithfully at the altar of the American Dream, praying to the gods of my time, gods of success, money, and power.
But again and again, midnight struck, and I opened my eyes to see the death of all those gods.
From that cemetery, I began to search once more, not out of courage, but because I knew that I either believed or died.
So I made a pilgrimage, again to another Mecca, Harvard Business School — knowing this time that I couldn&#39;t just accept the salvation it claimed to offer.
No, I knew there would be more work to do.
The work began late, in a dark corner of a crowded party, on an early and miserable Cambridge winter&#39;s night, when three friends and I wondered what young people in search of authenticity have been wondering for a very long time. for a long time: “And if we went on the road? »
We didn&#39;t know where to go or how to get there, but we knew we had to.
All our lives we longed, as Jack Kerouac wrote, to “sneak into the night and disappear somewhere,” and see what everyone was doing all over the country.
Although other voices said the risk was too great and the evidence too thin, we went anyway.
We traveled nearly 8,000 miles across America in the summer of 2013, through the pastures of Montana, through the desolation of Detroit, the swamps of New Orleans, where we found and worked with men and women who were creating small businesses whose intention defined goals.
Having been educated on the western edge of capitalism, this struck us as a revolutionary idea.
And that idea caught on, developing into a non-profit organization, MBAs Across America, a movement that landed me here on this stage today.
This idea developed because we discovered that our generation is hungry for purpose, meaning,
because we found countless entrepreneurs in every corner of America, creating jobs, changing lives, and needing a little help.
But if I&#39;m honest, it also grew because I fought for it.
I spared no effort to preach this gospel, to get more people to believe that we could mend the wounds of a broken country, one social enterprise at a time.
But it was this gospel journey that led me to this rather different gospel that I have come to share with you today.
This journey began one evening almost a year ago at the Museum of Natural History in New York, during a gala for former students of Harvard Business School.
Beneath a replica of a life-size whale, I sat with the titans of our time as they celebrated their peers and their good deeds.
There was pride in a room where the value and net assets under management exceeded $500 billion.
We looked at everything we had done, and it was good.
But luck would have it that, two days later, I had to go not very far from there, to Harlem. I found myself sitting in an urban farmhouse that had once been a wasteland, listening to a man named Tony tell me about the children who came here every day.
They all lived below the poverty line.
Many of them carried their possessions in a backpack to avoid losing them in a homeless shelter.
Some of them were on Tony&#39;s program, called Harlem Grown, to get their only meal of the day.
Tony told me he started Harlem Grown with his retirement money, after 20 years as a taxi driver.
He told me he was not getting paid because, despite its success, the program was struggling to get resources.
He told me he would accept any help he could get.
And I was there to help.
When I left Tony, I felt the burn and the salt of the tears welling up in my eyes.
I felt the weight of the revelation that I could sit in a room one evening where a few hundred people had 500 billion dollars and in another room two days later, barely 5 kilometers away, where a man lived without pay so that a child could have his only meal of the day.
It wasn&#39;t the glaring inequality that made me want to cry. It wasn&#39;t the thought of those starving, homeless children, it wasn&#39;t the rage towards the 1% or the pity towards the 99%.
No, I was disturbed because I had finally realized that I was on dialysis from a country that needed a kidney transplant.
I realized that my story replaced all those of those who were expected to take charge, even if they had nothing to hold on to; that my body replaced all the structural, systemic help that never went to Harlem, or Appalachia or floor -9, that my voice replaced all those voices that seemed too ignorant, too proletarian, too mismatched.
And this shame, this shame washed over me, like the shame of sitting in front of the television watching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium, again, and again, and again.
I had been duped, deceived, bamboozled.
But this time, the false Savior was me.
You see, I&#39;ve come a long way from the altar the night I thought the world was going to end, from a world where people spoke in tongues, saw suffering as a necessary act of God, and took a text as an infallible truth.
Yes, I&#39;ve come so far that I find myself exactly where I started.
Because it&#39;s just wrong to say that we live in an age of unbelief — no, we believe today just as much as before.
Some of us may believe in the prophecy of Brené Brown or Tony Robbins.
We can believe in the bible of the New Yorker or the Harvard Business Review.
We may believe deeply when we worship here at TED Church, but we desperately want to believe, we need to believe.
We speak the language of charismatic leaders who promise to solve all our problems.
We see suffering as a necessary act of capitalism, our god. We take the text of technological progress as the infallible truth.
And we hardly realize the human price we pay, when we fail to question a brick, lest it destroy all our foundations.
But if you are disturbed by the inadmissible things that we have come to accept, then it must be time for a rethink.
I don&#39;t have a gospel of disruption or innovation, or a triple bottom line.
In fact, I don&#39;t have a gospel of faith to share with you today.
I have, and I offer, a gospel of doubt.
The gospel of doubt does not ask that you stop believing, but that you believe in something new: that it is possible not to believe.
It is possible that the answers are wrong, that the questions themselves are wrong.
Yes, the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that we on this stage, in this room, are wrong.
Because it begs the question, &quot;Why?&quot; »
With all the power we hold in our hands, why are people still suffering so much?
This doubt leads me to share that we place my organization, MBAs Across America, in cessation of activity.
We have fired our team and closed our doors, and we will share our model freely with anyone who seizes the power to do this work without waiting for our permission.
This doubt forces me to renounce the role of savior that some expect of me, because there is not enough time and our chances are too slim to wait for second comings, when the truth is that there is no there will be no miracles here.
And this doubt, it regenerates me, it gives me hope, that when our problems overwhelm us, when the paths designed for us seem to lead us to our loss, when our healers bring no relief to our wounds, it will not be not our blind faith — no, it will be our humble doubt that will illuminate a little the darkness of our lives and our world, and allow us to raise our voices to whisper,
or to shout, or to say simply, very simply, &quot;There must be another way.&quot; »
THANKS.
The food crisis
is in the news every day.
But what is it ?
In some parts of the world there is too little food, or perhaps too much.
Elsewhere, GMOs save the world.
Maybe GMOs are the problem?
Too much agricultural runoff creates toxic oceans, declining food.
And so on.
I find the current climate of this discussion incredibly disheartening.
How can we bring this subject back to something we understand?
What does this apple tell us about the food crisis?
You all ate an apple last week, I&#39;m sure.
How old do you think she was when she was picked?
Two weeks ?
Two months ?
Eleven months. This is the average age of an apple in a grocery store in the United States.
And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s much different in Europe or anywhere else in the world.
We pick them, we put them in cold stores, we gas the stores. There is actually documented evidence of workers attempting to go into these environments to retrieve an apple, and dying because the atmosphere to slow apple ripening is toxic to humans.
How come none of you knew?
Why didn&#39;t I know that?
90% of the quality of this apple, all the antioxidants, are gone when it comes to us.
In fact, it&#39;s just a small ball of sugar.
How do we have so little information and how can we do better?
I think what&#39;s missing is a platform.
I know the platforms. I know computers. I was stuck in front of the internet when I was young.
I&#39;ve done some very strange things... ...on this platform.
But I met people, and I could express myself.
How can we express ourselves in food?
If we had a platform, we might feel able to ask: If only?
I asked myself: What if... the climate was democratic?
So, here is a map of the climate in the world.
The most productive areas in green, the least productive in red.
They change, replace each other, and Californian farmers are now Mexicans.
China is taking land from Brazil to grow better food, and we are slaves to the climate.
What if each country had its own productive climate?
How would that change the way we live?
What would this change for the quality of life and food?
The problem of the previous generation was to have more food and to have it cheaper.
Welcome to your global farm.
We have built a huge analog farm.
All these lines are cars, planes, trains and transport.
It is a miracle that we feed seven billion people with only a few of us involved in food production.
And what if...
we were building a digital farm?
A global digital farm.
What if you could take that apple, kind of digitize it, send it as particles through the air, and reassemble it on the other side?
What would happen?
Let&#39;s take a few quotes. They inspire me in what I do.
The first: “Japanese agriculture has no childhood, no water, no land and no future. This is what I discovered when I went to Minamisanriku, south of Fukushima, after the disaster.
The children have gone to Sendai and Tokyo, the land is contaminated, they already import 70% of their own food.
But it&#39;s not just about Japan.
2% of the US population is involved in agriculture.
What good answer can come from just 2% of the population?
Going around the world, 50% of the African population is under the age of 18.
80% of them do not want to become a farmer.
Farming is difficult.
The life of a small agricultural entrepreneur is miserable.
They go to town.
In India, farmers do not have access to basic services. There are more farmer suicides this year than the previous 10.
It&#39;s uncomfortable to talk about.
Where are they going?
In the city.
There are no more young people, and everyone is leaving.
So how can we build a platform that would inspire young people?
Welcome to the new tractor.
This is my combine harvester.
A few years ago now, I went to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, and Home Depot and started hacking.
I built stupid things, I made the plants dance, I connected them to my computer, and I killed them all; I killed many.
I finally managed to bring them to life.
And I created one of the most intimate relationships of my entire life, because I was learning the language of plants.
I wanted to make it bigger.
I was told, &quot;Have fun, young man!&quot;
Here&#39;s an old electronics lab that nobody wants.
What can you do ? »
With my team, we built a farm inside the Media Lab, a famous place, not for biology, but rather for computing.
Inside these 6 m², we produced enough food to feed around 300 people once a month. It is little food.
There are a lot of interesting technologies in there.
But the most interesting thing?
Beautiful roots, white, green, deep colors and a monthly harvest.
Is it a new cafeteria?
Is this a new retail experience?
Is this a new grocery store?
I can assure you of something: this is the first time anyone in the Media Lab has pulled out the roots of anything.
We have bagged salads, there&#39;s nothing wrong with that.
But what happens when you have an image processing expert, a data scientist, a roboticist, digging up roots and thinking, “I know a little about it. I can do it, I want to try. »
In this setting, we would grow the plants and bring some back to the lab, because if you grow them, you don&#39;t throw away, you get attached to them.
I have funny taste buds now; I&#39;m afraid to let anyone eat something without tasting it, because I want it to taste good.
I eat lettuce every day and can give its pH within 0.1.
And I say, “No, its pH is 6.1, you can&#39;t eat it today. »
This lettuce that day was super soft.
She was super sweet because the plant was stressed and she had caused a chemical reaction in her to protect herself: &quot;I&#39;m not going to die!&quot; »
And plants that don&#39;t want to die seem sweet to me.
Technologists fall backwards in the face of plant physiology.
We thought other people should be able to try.
We wanted to see what people can create, so we designed a lab that you can ship anywhere.
Then we built it.
On the front of the Media Lab, there is my laboratory, which has about 30 detection points per plant.
If you know the genome or the genetics, that&#39;s the phenome, okay?
Phenomenons.
When you say, &quot;I like strawberries from Mexico,&quot; you really like strawberries from the climate that produced the phrase you like.
So if you code the climate - this amount of CO2 and this amount of oxygen create a recipe - you are coding the expression of this plant, the nutrition of this plant, the size of this plant, the shape, the color, the texture.
We need data, so we put in a bunch of sensors to tell us what&#39;s going on.
Think about your indoor plants! You&#39;re super sad because you&#39;re wondering, “Why are you dying? Why do not you talk to me ? »
Farmers acquire a unique ability when they turn 60 or 70.
They can tell when a plant dies it&#39;s a nitrogen deficiency, a calcium deficiency, or it needs more water.
This unique ability is not passed on.
Here are the omens of the &quot;farmer in the cloud&quot;.
We track this data over time.
We correlate them with particular plants.
These are all broccoli in my lab, by IP address.
Our broccoli can be reached by IP address.
And if that isn&#39;t weird enough, you click once and get a plant profile.
And it gives you the downloadable evolution of that plant, but not the way you think, not just when it&#39;s ready.
When does it reach the nutrition I need?
When does it reach the desired taste?
Is she getting too much water?
Does it get too much sun?
Alerts.
She can talk to me, she dialogues, we have a language.
I think she&#39;s the first plant Facebook user!
This is her plant profile and this plant will start making friends.
I think so: it will make friends with other plants that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, less potassium.
We will learn more about a complexity than we could only guess.
Maybe they won&#39;t become our friends, maybe they will, it&#39;s up to us.
This is my lab.
It&#39;s a little more organized, my job is to design data centers for hospitals, so I&#39;m familiar with creating controlled environments.
And so, within that environment, we experience all kinds of things.
This process, aeroponic, was developed by NASA for the Mir space station to reduce the amount of water sent into space.
This process gives the plant exactly what it wants: water, minerals and oxygen.
The roots are not that complicated. When you give them that, you get an amazing result.
It is as if the plant had two hearts.
And because she has two hearts, she grows four or five times faster.
It&#39;s a perfect world.
We have advanced in techno and seeds for an unfavorable world and we will continue to do so, but we also have a new tool, which is a perfect world.
We grew all kinds of things.
These tomatoes had not been produced and sold for 150 years.
Do you know that we have rare and old seed banks?
Seed banks.
It&#39;s incredible.
They have genetic material, things you&#39;ve never eaten.
I&#39;m the only person in this room who&#39;s eaten that kind of tomato.
It&#39;s a sauce tomato that we don&#39;t know how to cook. We ate this tomato. And it wasn&#39;t great.
We&#39;ve done things with protein, all kinds of things.
We grew humans. Maybe you would, but we didn&#39;t.
What we realized was... the tool was too big, and too expensive.
I started distributing it around the world and it cost around $100,000.
Finding someone with 100,000 in their pocket isn&#39;t easy, so we tried to make it smaller.
It was the project of one of my undergraduate mechanical engineering students, Camille.
Camille and I and the whole team, we tried all summer, how to make it cheaper, that it works better, that others can do it.
We dropped them off at schools, from sixth to final year.
And if you want to stay humble, try to teach children.
I went into the school and said, “Set the humidity to 65%. »
A schoolboy said to me: “What is humidity? »
I replied, “Water in the air. »
He said, “There&#39;s no water in the air, you&#39;re an idiot. »
And I said, &quot;Very well...
Do not trust me.
Set it to 100.&quot;
He sets it to 100 and what happens?
It starts to condense, fog up and eventually drip.
And he says, “Oh. Humidity is rain.
Why didn&#39;t you tell me? »
We created an interface like that of a game.
They have a 3D environment, they can connect anywhere in the world from their smartphone or tablet.
They have the different parts of the bots, the sensors.
They choose recipes created by other children all over the world.
They select and activate this recipe, they plant a seedling.
As it grows, they make changes.
“Why does a plant need CO2?
CO2 is bad? He kills people! »
Step up the CO2, the plant dies.
Reduce the CO2, the plant is doing very well.
Harvest the plant, You have just created a new digital recipe.
It is an iterative design, development, and exploration process.
They can upload all the data about this new plant they developed or the new digital recipe and what it did - was it better or worse?
Imagine this as the little hearts of the process.
We are going to learn so much.
That&#39;s one of the food-computers, as we call them, in a school after three weeks.
That&#39;s three weeks of growth.
But more importantly, it was the first time this kid thought he could be a farmer – or he could want to be a farmer.
We put everything in open source.
Everything is online; try to build your first foodcomputer.
It&#39;s going to be difficult - I tell you.
We are at the beginning, but everything is there.
It&#39;s very important to me that it&#39;s easily accessible.
We will continue to move in this direction.
They are farmers, electrical, mechanical and environmental engineers, computer scientists, plant scientists, economists, town planners,
on a single platform, doing what they are good at.
But we saw a little too big.
This is my new installation that has just been launched.
This warehouse could be anywhere.
That&#39;s why I chose it.
And inside this warehouse we&#39;re going to build something a bit like this.
These already exist.
Look.
These also exist.
One makes it possible to grow green, the other makes it possible to produce the Ebola vaccine.
It&#39;s cool that this plant, the big winner of the DARPA challenge, is one of the reasons for the progress on Ebola.
The factories produce the protein that resists the Ebola virus.
From pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, to simple lettuce.
But those two things are nothing alike, and that&#39;s where I&#39;m at in my field.
Everything is different.
We&#39;re at this weird stage of, “We&#39;re almost there. It&#39;s a bit like: “Here is my black box. -- No, buy mine.
-- No, no - I have the intellectual property, completely valid.
Don&#39;t buy his, buy mine. »
In fact, we are just at the beginning, at a time when society is also changing.
While we are asking for more food but cheaper, we are asking for better food that respects the environment.
When you have a McDonald&#39;s ad explaining what&#39;s in the McNuggets - the most mysterious food product of all time - that their marketing campaign is based on, everything changes.
From now on,
personal food computers, food servers, and food data centers operate on the open phenome.
Think open genome, but we&#39;ll add little climate recipes, like Wikipedia, that you can grab, update, and grow.
What does this look like in reality?
Remember the planet connected by lines?
We are starting to have the beacons.
We start sending info about food, rather than sending food.
This is not only my dream, these are the places where we are already deploying.
Food computers, food servers, soon to be food data centers, connecting people to share information.
The future of food isn&#39;t about fighting what&#39;s wrong.
We know what&#39;s wrong.
The future of food is about connecting the next billion farmers and empowering them with a platform to ask and answer the question, &quot;What if?&quot; »
Thank you.
Sometimes I feel ashamed to be a European.
Last year more than a million people in need of our help arrived in Europe and our response was downright pathetic.
There are so many contradictions.
We mourn the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Kurdi, yet more than 200 children have since drowned in the Mediterranean.
International treaties recognize that refugees are a collective responsibility, yet we accept that little Lebanon hosts more Syrians than all of Europe combined.
We lament the existence of smugglers, yet we make them the only viable route to seek asylum in Europe.
We lack manpower, yet we prevent people corresponding to our economic and demographic needs from coming to Europe.
We proclaim our liberal values in opposition to fundamentalist Islam, yet -- we have policies of repression that arrest underage asylum seekers, separate children from their families and seize refugee property.
What do we do ?
How did we come to this, that we adopted such an inhumane response to a humanitarian crisis?
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s due to a lack of interest, at least I don&#39;t want to believe it.
I think it&#39;s because our politicians don&#39;t have a vision, they don&#39;t know how to adapt the international asylum rules, created more than 50 years ago, to globalization.
I want to step back and ask two fundamental questions, the two questions we all need to ask.
First, why is the current system not working?
Second, how can we fix it?
The current refugee regime was created as a result of the aftermath of World War II by these people.
Its primary purpose is to ensure that when a state fails, or worse, turns against its people, people have a place to go, to live in safety and with dignity until they can return.
It was created precisely for situations such as the current situation in Syria.
Through an international convention signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and an international organization, the UNHCR, States have agreed to reciprocally admit to their territory people fleeing conflict and persecution.
But today, this system is failing.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In practice, our immigration policies block the path to safety.
In theory, refugees have the right to integration or return to their country of origin.
But in practice, they remain stuck in eternal limbo.
In theory, refugees are a common global responsibility.
In practice, geography means that countries close to the conflict host the overwhelming majority of refugees.
The system isn&#39;t broken because the rules are bad
but because we don&#39;t apply them adequately to a changing world, and that&#39;s what we need to reconsider.
I will explain to you how the current system works.
How does the current refugee regime work?
But not from an institutional perspective, more from a refugee&#39;s point of view.
Imagine a Syrian woman. Let&#39;s call her Amira.
For me, Amira represents
many people I met in the area.
Amira, like 25% of refugees in the world, is a woman with children, and she cannot return home because she comes from this city that you see: Homs. A city that was once beautiful and historic and is now in ruins.
Amira cannot go back there.
But Amira has no hope of settling in a third country, because there is a lottery available to only less than 1% of refugees.
Amira and her family face an impossible choice.
They have three options.
The first option is for Amira to take her family to a camp.
In the camp, she could be helped, but there is little future for Amira and her family.
The camps are in austere and arid places, often in the desert.
In the Zaatari camp in Jordan, at night you hear the shelling from across the border.
Economic activity is restricted.
Education is often of poor quality.
Around the world, around 80% of refugees who are in camps must stay there for at least 5 years.
It&#39;s a miserable life, and that&#39;s probably the reason why, in reality, only 9% of Syrians choose this option.
An alternative for Amira is to head to the urban area of a neighboring country, such as Amman or Beirut.
This is an option chosen by around 75% of Syrian refugees.
But it also has challenges.
Refugees in such urban areas often do not have the right to work.
They often don&#39;t have access to help.
And so when Amira and her family have spent all their savings, they will have nothing left and will be in urban misery.
There is a third possibility that an increasing number of Syrians are choosing.
Amira can seek hope for her family by risking their lives on a dangerous and perilous journey to another country, and that is what we see today in Europe.
We therefore offer refugees an almost impossible choice between three options: encampment, urban misery or a dangerous journey.
For refugees, that choice is today&#39;s refugee regime.
But I believe that is a false choice.
We can reconsider this choice.
The reason we limit these options is because we think they are the only options available to refugees, but that is not the case.
Politicians see this as a zero-sum problem, if we benefit refugees, citizens pay the price.
We tend to think of refugees as an inevitable cost or a burden on society.
But they don&#39;t have to be. They can contribute.
What I mean is that there are ways to increase opportunities and that everyone benefits: host countries and communities, our societies and refugees.
And I want to suggest four ways to transform our view of refugees.
These four perspectives have one thing in common: they embrace the opportunities of globalization, mobility and markets, and modernize the way we think about the refugee problem.
The first idea is that of enabling environments. It starts with the fundamental recognition that refugees are human beings like everyone else, but with extraordinary circumstances.
With my colleagues from Oxford, we embarked on a research project in Uganda, observing the economic life of refugees.
We chose Uganda not because it is representative of all host countries.
He is exceptional.
Unlike the majority of host countries, Uganda has provided an economic opportunity for refugees.
It gives them the right to work, the freedom to move.
And the results are extraordinary, for the refugees and for the host community.
In the capital, Kampala, we found that 21% of refugees own a business employing people and 40% of these employees are natives of the host country.
In other words, refugees create jobs for citizens of the host country.
Even in the camps, we have discovered extraordinary examples of dynamic and thriving businesses.
For example, in a village called Nakivale, we have the example of Congolese refugees running digital music sharing businesses.
We found a Rwandan who runs a business to enable young people to play video games on recycled consoles and televisions.
Despite the hardships of extreme constraints, the refugees are innovating and the man you see is a Congolese named Demou-Kay.
Demou-Kay arrived in the camp with very few possessions, but he wanted to become a director.
So, with friends and colleagues, he started a community radio station, he rented a camera and made films.
He&#39;s made two documentaries with and for our team and he&#39;s building a successful business out of next to nothing.
These are the kinds of examples that should guide our response to refugees.
Rather than seeing refugees as inevitably dependent on humanitarian aid, we must provide them with the opportunity for human development.
Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food are very important in the emergency phase, but we need to go further.
We must provide the opportunity of connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, access to banks.
Everything that we take for granted, that integrates us into the global economy can and should be offered to refugees.
The second idea I want to talk about is economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all host countries in the world have Uganda&#39;s approach.
Most host countries do not open their economies to refugees in this way.
But there are always pragmatic options we can use.
Last April, I went to Jordan with my colleague, the development economist, Paul Collier, and we thought about an idea that we had there with the international community and the government, an idea to create jobs for Syrians while supporting Jordan&#39;s national development strategy.
It is the idea of an economic zone where we could potentially integrate the employment of refugees as well as the employment of natives of the host country.
15 minutes from the Zaatari camp, which hosts 83,000 refugees, is the King Hussein Bin Talal Development Zone.
The government spent more than $100 million to connect it to the electricity grid and the road network, but two things were missing: access to labor and foreign investment.
so that refugees can work there rather than being stuck in camps, support their families, develop skills through vocational training before returning to Syria.
We recognized that Jordan would benefit from this, as its development strategy required moving from a middle-income country to an industrial country.
The refugees would benefit from it but it would also contribute to the reconstruction of Syria after the war, recognizing that we must incubate the refugees because they are the best resource to rebuild Syria.
We published this idea in the journal Foreign Affairs.
King Abdullah picked up the idea.
This was announced at the London conference on Syria and a test will start during the summer.
The third idea I want to put to you is the notion of preference between states and refugees leading to positive outcomes that you see in this selfie featuring Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee.
We rarely ask refugees what they want, where they want to go, but we can do it and it will be better for everyone.
Economist Alvin Roth developed the idea of matching markets, where the order of preference of the parties determines their eventual match.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teytelboym have looked at ways to apply this idea to refugees, asking refugees to rank destinations but also allowing states to rank the kind of refugees they want based on skills or languages, and then to match them.
Of course, quotas should be put in place for diversity and vulnerability, but it is a way to increase the chances of a match.
The idea of matching is successfully used for, for example, distributing college students, matching kidney donors and patients, and the algorithm exists on dating sites.
Why not apply this to offer choice to refugees?
It could also be used at the national level where one of the biggest challenges is persuading local communities to accept refugees.
Currently, in my country, for example, we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to cities, which makes no sense.
Matching markets bring together these preferences and listen to the needs and demands of the host population and refugees.
The fourth idea I want to talk about is the humanitarian visa principle.
The tragedies and disorders seen in Europe could have been avoided.
They stem from a fundamental contradiction in European asylum policy: in order to seek asylum in Europe, you must arrive spontaneously by embarking on a dangerous journey that I have already spoken about.
But why are these trips necessary in the era of low-cost airlines and modern consular means?
These trips are not necessary and last year they led to the death of more than 3,000 people at Europe&#39;s borders and within Europe.
If refugees had the right to travel directly and seek asylum in Europe, we would avoid this. And we can do that through humanitarian visas which allow people to get a visa from an embassy or consulate in a neighboring country and then pay for their ferry or plane ride to Europe.
It costs around €1,000 to pay a courier from Turkey to the Greek islands.
A low-cost flight from Bodrum to Frankfurt costs €200.
If we allowed refugees, that would have major benefits.
It would save lives, reduce the market for smugglers and mark an end to the disorder seen on the European frontline in areas like the Greek islands.
It is the laws that prevent us from doing so, not a rational solution.
It is an idea that has been applied.
Brazil took a forward-thinking approach and more than 2,000 Syrians obtained humanitarian visas, traveled to Brazil and, upon arrival, applied for refugee status.
In this configuration, every Syrian who did this received refugee status and was recognized as a refugee.
There is a historical precedent.
Between 1922 and 1942, these Nansen passports were used as travel documents allowing 450,000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens to travel to Europe and claim refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
And Nansen&#39;s International Refugee Office received the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this viable strategy.
Each of these four ideas that I presented to you are ways to expand Amira&#39;s choices.
These are ways that we have to increase the choice of refugees beyond these options, these three impossible options that I have detailed for you, while benefiting others.
In conclusion, we need a new perspective, a vision that expands the choice of refugees but recognizes that they don&#39;t have to be a burden.
There is nothing inevitable about refugees being a cost.
Yes, they are a humanitarian responsibility, but they are human beings with skills, talents, aspirations and the ability to contribute, if we allow them.
In the new world, migration will not stop.
What we have seen in Europe will continue for years.
People will travel again, populations will be displaced and we have to find rational and realistic ways to manage it, not based on the old logics of humanitarian aid, charity, but building on the opportunities offered by globalization, markets and mobility.
I urge you to wake up and I urge our politicians to wake up to this challenge.
Thank you so much.
When I was little, I dreamed of the ocean.
A wild place, very colorful and full of life, home to bizarre and fantastic creatures.
I imagined big sharks reigning supreme and graceful sea turtles twirling through the corals.
First a marine biologist, then a photographer, I spent most of my career looking for places as magical as the ones I dreamed of as a child.
As you can see, I started exploring water very early.
But the first time I really went underwater was when I was about 10 years old.
I vividly remember giving determined strokes to reach this old cannon embedded in a shallow coral reef.
When I was finally able to catch it, I looked up and found myself surrounded by fish in every color of the rainbow.
That day, I fell in love with the ocean.
Thomas Peschak Marine Conservation Photographer In 40 years on Earth, I&#39;ve had the great privilege of exploring some of the craziest seascapes for National Geographic and the Save Our Seas Foundation.
I&#39;ve photographed everything from huge sharks to tiny ones that fit in the palm of your hand.
I smelled the fish on the breath of humpback whales feeding beside me in cold Canadian waters near the Great Bear Rainforest.
I even knew all about green turtle love rituals in the Mozambique Channel.
We all leave a footprint on the ocean and vice versa.
And the pristine seas that I dreamed of as a child are always harder to find.
They are always smaller and more threatened.
As we humans maintain our role as the planet&#39;s greatest predator, I have witnessed and photographed first-hand repercussions.
For a long time, I thought I had to shock my audience with disturbing images to get them out of their indifference.
This approach has its merits, but I came back from it.
In my opinion, the best way to produce change is to sell love.
If you will, I am a couple maker and as a photographer I have the unique opportunity to reveal animals and entire ecosystems lying beneath the surface of the ocean.
You can&#39;t love and fight for something if you don&#39;t know it exists.
Revealing this - that&#39;s the power of marine photography.
Among the hundreds of underwater places I have seen, a handful of these landscapes have touched me deeply.
I saw the first of these landscapes about 10 years ago off the wild and rugged coast of South Africa.
Every summer, huge schools of sardines move north, a mass migration phenomenon called the Sardine Run.
A mad dash of these fish
where hordes of hungry and agile predators hunt them down.
Common dolphins hunt together and manage to isolate sardines from the main school and create small schools.
They dive and trap fish up against the surface and swoop in to enjoy their wriggling feast.
The sharks follow closely.
For many people, sharks and dolphins are sworn enemies, but during the Sardine Run, they live side by side.
In fact, dolphins help sharks feed more efficiently.
Without the dolphins, the small shoals created are more sparse and the sharks often end up with a &quot;sardine doughnut&quot; or a mouthful of water.
I had a few spirited moments with the sharks on the Sardine Run, but I know they don&#39;t see me as prey.
I received blows and was jostled like all the other participants in this brawling banquet.
Let&#39;s leave the African coast to go east, across the immensity of the Indian Ocean to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral islands.
During the monsoon season, manta rays from all over the archipelago travel to a tiny islet in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.
Armies of crustaceans, most smaller than a marble, are the staple food of manta rays.
When plankton concentrations are low, manta rays feed on their own and they flip backwards, in a loop, like a puppy chasing its tail.
When the density of plankton increases, the rays line up in single file and form these long chains. Every delicious bite that escapes the first is gobbled up by the second or the next.
When the concentration of plankton reaches its peak, the manta rays swim ever closer in a rotating movement by which they feed.
As they swirl through this tight formation, the column of manta rays creates its own vortex, sucking in and bringing plankton right into the rays&#39; cavernous mouths.
The experience of diving among these innumerable rays is absolutely unforgettable.
When I first photographed Hanifaru, the site was unprotected and threatened by development.
I&#39;ve worked with NGOs like Manta Trust, and my photos have helped make Hanifaru a marine protected area.
Fishermen from neighboring islands hunted these manta rays, they used their skin to make traditional drums.
Today, they are the staunchest conservationists and manta rays contribute more than $8 million to the Maldives economy each year.
I&#39;ve always wanted to go back in time and see an era where the maps were incomplete or said, &quot;Dragons here.&quot;
I got the closest to it by visiting these remote atolls in the heart of the Indian Ocean.
Far, far away from boat and fishing lines, diving in these waters is a poignant memory of what our oceans once looked like.
Bassas da India is largely unknown. It&#39;s a tiny wedge of coral in the Mozambique Channel.
Its barrier forms a shield that protects its inner lagoon, a nursery for Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are anything but shy, even during the day.
Something told me they would be even bolder and more numerous at night.
I found myself facing more sharks than ever, gathered on a single outcrop.
Photographing and sharing moments like these reminds me of why I chose this path.
Not long ago I was working on a project in Baja California for National Geographic.
Halfway down the Pacific coast is San Ignacio Lagoon, where the gray whale comes to give birth.
For a century, this coast was the scene of a systematic massacre, more than 20,000 gray whales were killed there, leaving only a few hundred to survive.
Today, the descendants of these same whales play on the surface with their offspring and they even interact with us.
This species has done remarkably well.
On the other side of the peninsula is Cabo Pulmo, a sleepy fishing village.
Decades of overfishing have brought them to the brink of collapse.
In 1995, local fishermen convinced the authorities to make their waters a marine reserve.
But what happened next was a miracle.
In 2005, after only a decade of protection, scientists recorded the greatest increase in fish.
But don&#39;t take my word for it, come with me.
In one breath swim the depths with me amidst one of the largest and densest schools of fish I have ever encountered.
We all have the ability to inspire hope.
And through my photos, I would like to convey the message that it is not too late for our oceans.
And I would especially like to highlight the resilience of nature in the face of 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, I will have to search hard to make photos like this, while creating images that show our respectful coexistence with the ocean which,
I hope, will become everyday for me.
To thrive and survive doing my job, you really have to be an unfailing optimist.
I always work thinking that the next fabulous image that will serve my purpose is all ready, just behind the next reef, in the heart of the next lagoon, or who knows, maybe in the one after that.
When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the heart of Zimbabwe&#39;s national health policy.
The new government was emerging from a long war of independence and immediately announced a socialist program: health services, primary education became essentially free.
A major expansion of rural health centers has placed approximately 80% of the population within two hours&#39; walk of one, a truly remarkable achievement.
In 1980, the year of independence, 25% of children in Zimbabwe were fully immunized.
In 1990, a decade later, this proportion was 80%.
I felt extremely privileged to be part of this transformation, a revolution.
The excitement, the camaraderie was palpable.
Working with brilliant Zimbabweans — scientists, doctors, activists — I felt connected not just to an African independence movement, but to a progressive global movement for public health.
But there were considerable challenges.
Zimbabwe reported its first case of AIDS in 1985, the year I arrived.
I had cared for a few AIDS patients in the early 1980s during my medical training at Harlem Hospital, but — we had no idea what was in store for Africa.
My first few days there, the infection rate was 2%.
This would skyrocket to one in four adults by the time I left Harare 17 years later.
By the mid-1990s, I had told hundreds of middle-aged people that they had HIV.
I had seen friends and colleagues, my students, patients in the hospital die.
In response to this, my colleagues and I set up a clinic.
We were demonstrating the use of condoms.
We launched education in school, interventions in the workplace.
We were doing research. We gave advice to the partners of infected men so that they knew how to protect themselves.
We worked hard, and at the time I thought I was doing my best.
I provided excellent treatment, as good as I could get.
But I wasn&#39;t talking about structural change.
Former UN Secretary Kofi Annan spoke honestly about his personal failure that led to the Rwandan genocide.
In 1994, he was the director of the peace department at the UN.
At a memorial 10 years later, he said: &quot;At the time I thought I was doing my best, but I realized after the genocide that I could and should have done more to sound the alarm and gather support. »
The AIDS epidemic took the health community by surprise, and today, when the World Health Organization estimates that 39 million people have died from this disease, I am not alone in feeling remorse and regrets for not having done more, sooner.
But when I was living in Zimbabwe, I didn&#39;t see my role as that of an advocate or a politician.
I was there because of my technical skills, my clinical skills and my epidemiological research.
For me, my job was to care for patients and do research to better understand transmission patterns within the population, and I hoped that we would slow the spread of the virus.
I was aware that marginal populations had a very high risk of having and dying of AIDS.
And on the sugar plantations, which up close looked more like feudal strongholds than any modern business, 60% of pregnant women had HIV.
I worked to show that being infected was not a moral failure but rather linked to a culture of male superiority, forced immigrant labor and colonialism.
The whites were largely spared.
As health professionals, our tools were pitifully weak: imploring people to change their individual behavior, to use condoms, to reduce the number of partners.
Infection rates were climbing. And when a treatment was available in the West, which remained our strongest weapon against the virus, it was not affordable to the African public sector.
I did not denounce the unequal access to these life-saving drugs or the underlying economic and political systems that were driving up infection rates in large sections of the population.
I rationalized my silence by telling myself that I was only a visitor to this country, that sounding the alarm could get me deported, prevent me from doing my job, taking care of my patients, do much needed research.
So I didn&#39;t rebel against the government&#39;s initial position on AIDS.
I didn&#39;t voice my concerns out loud.
Many doctors and health professionals may think that I did nothing wrong.
Our pact with our patients, the Hippocratic oath and its variants, evokes the inviolability of the patient-doctor relationship.
I did everything I could for every patient I had.
But I knew that epidemics appear along the cracks in our society, reflecting not only our biology, but most notably patterns of marginalization, exclusion, discriminations linked to race, gender, sexuality, class, etc
It was true for AIDS.
This was true recently for Ebola.
Medical anthropologists like Paul Farmer, who has worked on AIDS in Haiti, have called this &quot;structural violence.&quot; Structural because inequalities are embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world, and are often invisible to the eyes of the privileged and those in power; and violence because its impact—untimely death, suffering, disease—is violent.
We do little for our patients if we do not recognize these social injustices.
Sounding the alarm is the first step towards good public health practice, and it&#39;s how we can rally support to revolutionize and create change together.
Today, I am not silent.
I talk about many things, even if they make those who listen to them uncomfortable, even if they make me uncomfortable.
A lot of what I say has to do with racial differences and institutionalized racism, things that are no longer supposed to exist in this country, let alone in medical practice or public health.
But they exist and we pay for them by shortening lives.
That is why sounding the alarm about the health impact of racism in the United States, the current institutional and interpersonal violence faced by people of color, entwined with our sad legacy of 250 years of slavery, 90 years of Jim Crow and 60 years of imperfect equality, sounding the alarm about this is fundamental to the successful completion of my job as New York City Health Commissioner.
In New York, premature mortality — dying before reaching age 65 — is 50% higher for black men than for whites.
In 2012, a black woman was 10 times more likely than a white woman to die in childbirth.
Although we have made tremendous strides in reducing infant mortality rates, a black baby is still almost three times more likely than a white baby to die in its first year.
New York is no exception.
These statistics are compared with statistics made across the United States.
A recent analysis by the New York Times reported that there were, in the country,
1.5 million black men missing. They spoke of the fact that more than one in six black men who would be between the ages of 25 and 54 today no longer led a normal life, but were in prison or died prematurely.
There is great injustice in the daily and disproportionate violence against young black men, the focus of recent #BlackLivesMatter protests.
But we must remember that persistent disparate rates and the occurrence and outcome of common diseases—heart disease, cancers, diabetes, HIV—diseases that can kill softly and silently and take away even more black lives prematurely.
When the #BlackLivesMatter movement took shape, I was frustrated and angry that the medical community was reluctant to use the word “racism” in our research and work.
You must have felt something every time I said it.
Our students have participated in protests in white coats, but the medical community has largely stood aside as current discrimination continues to affect disease patterns and mortality.
And I fear that the fashion for personalized and precise medicine, the search for biological or genetic targets for a more suitable treatment, could inadvertently cause us to lose sight of the big picture, that is to say the daily context, where a person lives, grows, works, loves, fundamental factor in determining the health of the population: for too many of us, poor health.
As healthcare professionals, in our daily work, whether in practice or in research, we witness a great injustice: homeless people who are unable to follow medical advice because they have other priorities; transgender youth thinking about suicide because our society is too rigid; the single mother who is made to feel responsible for her child&#39;s ill health.
Our role as healthcare professionals is not just to treat our patients but to sound the alarm and promote change.
Whether it&#39;s legal or not, our position in society makes us very credible and we shouldn&#39;t spoil that.
I regret that I did not speak in Zimbabwe, and I have promised myself that as New York City Commissioner of Health, I will use every opportunity I have to sound the alarm and support for health equity.
I will speak out against racism, and I hope you will join me, and I will join you in speaking out against sexism or any other form of inequality.
It is time to stand up and, as a community, speak out against structural inequalities.
We don&#39;t need to have all the answers to call for change.
We only need courage.
The health of our patients, of each one of us, depends on it.
Show of hands: How many of you have ever deleted a Facebook friend because they made an offensive remark about politics, religion, parenting, food?
How many of you avoid at least one person just so you don&#39;t have to talk to them?
Before, to have a polite conversation, we followed the advice of Henry Higgins in “My Fair Lady”: stick to the weather and your health.
But these days, with climate change and the anti-vaccination movement, those topics… aren&#39;t very safe anymore.
The world we live in, this world where any conversation can potentially turn into controversy, where our politicians cannot talk to each other, and where even the most trivial matters have supporters and detractors, this world is not normal.
Pew Research did a study of 10,000 American adults and found that right now we are more polarized, more divided, than ever before.
We compromise less, which means we don&#39;t listen to each other.
We decide where to live, who to marry and even who are going to be our friends, based on our already established beliefs.
Again, that doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t listen to each other.
A conversation requires a balance between speaking and listening, and somewhere along the way we lost that balance.
This is partly due to technology.
The laptops you all have, either in your hands or close enough to grab them quickly.
According to Pew Research, about a third of American teenagers send more than 100 text messages a day.
Many of them, the majority in fact, are more likely to text their friends than talk to them face to face.
There&#39;s a great article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; magazine.
written by Paul Barnwell, a high school teacher.
His students did a communication project.
He wanted to teach them to talk about a particular topic without notes.
He said this: &quot;I realized...&quot;
“I&#39;ve come to realize that the ability to hold a conversation is perhaps the most neglected skill to teach.
Children spend hours talking and brainstorming via screens, but they rarely have the opportunity to hone their interpersonal communication skills.
It may sound weird, but you have to ask yourself: in the 21st century, what skill is more important than knowing how to hold a coherent conversation?
My job is to talk to people: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, plumbers.
I talk to people I like and people I don&#39;t like.
I talk to people I deeply disagree with.
But I still have fantastic conversations with them.
For the next 10 minutes, I would like to teach you how to speak and how to listen.
Many of you have heard advice about this: look people in the eye, think about interesting topics beforehand, look around, nod and smile to show your attention, repeat what you&#39;ve heard, or summarize.
Forget all that.
It&#39;s shit.
There&#39;s no reason to learn how to demonstrate that you&#39;re paying attention, if you&#39;re actually paying attention.
I use the exact same skills as a professional interviewer as I do in my daily life.
So I&#39;m going to teach you how to question people and it&#39;s going to help you learn how to be better communicators.
Learn how to have a conversation without wasting your time, without getting bored, and above all, without offending anyone.
We&#39;ve all had amazing conversations before.
We have had some. We know what it is.
The kind of conversation that makes you feel involved and inspired, or makes you feel like you&#39;ve really connected, or been fully understood.
There&#39;s no reason most of our conversations shouldn&#39;t be like this.
I have 10 ground rules. I&#39;ll explain them to you but honestly, if you pick one up and fully master it, you&#39;ll already have better conversations.
Number 1: no multitasking.
Not just putting down your laptop, tablet or car keys, or whatever you have in your hand.
Be present.
Live in the moment.
Don&#39;t think about arguing with your boss,
or what you are going to eat tonight.
If you want to end the conversation, do so, but don&#39;t just be halfway there.
Number 2: Don&#39;t lecture.
If you want to give your opinion, without any opportunity to respond, discuss, react or grow, write a blog.
I have a very good reason for not inviting critics to my show: they are very annoying.
Conservatives are going to hate Obama, food stamps and abortion.
The Liberals are going to hate the big banks, the oil industry and Dick Cheney.
Completely predictable.
You don&#39;t want to be like this.
You should start every conversation with the idea that you are going to learn something.
Scott Peck, the famous therapist, said that to really listen, you have to step aside.
Sometimes that means putting aside your own opinion.
He said the speaker will feel this acceptance, and become less and less vulnerable and more likely to offer the hidden recesses of their mind to the listener.
Consider that you have things to learn.
Bill Nye: “Everyone knows something that you don&#39;t. »
I put it this way: every person is an expert in something.
Number 3: Ask open-ended questions.
For that, take inspiration from journalists.
Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how.
If you ask a complex question, the answer will be simple.
If I ask you, “Were you terrified? »
you will answer the most powerful word of this sentence, here &quot;terrified&quot;, and the answer will be yes or no.
“Were you angry? &quot;Yes, very angry.&quot; »
Let them describe. They are the ones who know.
Ask questions such as, “How was it? »
&quot; What did you feel ? »
Because they might need a moment of reflection and then you will have a much more interesting answer.
Number 4: go with the flow.
It means that ideas will come to your mind and you have to let them out of your mind.
We&#39;ve often heard interviews where the guest speaks for several minutes, then the host picks up and asks a question that seems to come out of nowhere, or has already been answered.
The host probably stopped listening 2 minutes ago as he was thinking about his next question, a very smart one he was determined to ask.
We do the same.
We sit, chatting with someone, then we remember our meeting with Hugh Jackman in a cafe.
We stop listening.
Stories and ideas will come to you.
You have to let them come and then leave.
Number 5: If you don&#39;t know, say you don&#39;t know.
People on the radio, especially on NPR, are more aware that what they say is being recorded; they are therefore more careful when they talk about their expertise and what they are sure they know.
Do the same. Fish on the side of caution.
Speech should not be taken lightly.
Number 6: Don&#39;t compare your experience to theirs.
If they talk about the loss of a family member, don&#39;t talk about the loss of a family member.
If they talk about the problems they have at work, don&#39;t tell them you hate your job.
It&#39;s not the same, ever.
Every experience is unique.
More importantly, it&#39;s not about you.
No need to use this moment to prove how awesome you are or how much you&#39;ve suffered.
Someone asked his IQ to Stephen Hawking, who replied: “No idea. Those who brag about their IQ are dummies. »
Conversations are not promotional opportunities.
Number 7: Try not to repeat yourself.
It&#39;s condescending and very annoying and we tend to do that.
Especially during conversations at work, or with our children, we have a message to convey so we tirelessly reformulate it.
Don&#39;t.
Number 8: spare the details.
Frankly, it doesn&#39;t matter the years, the names, the dates and all those details that you can&#39;t remember.
Never mind. What matters is you.
People are interested in you, in what you have in common.
Forget the details. Leave them aside.
Number 9: It&#39;s not the last, but it&#39;s the most important.
Listen.
I can&#39;t tell you how many important people have said that listening is perhaps the most important skill to develop.
Buddha said, and I paraphrase: “If your mouth is open, you are not learning. »
And Calvin Collidge said, &quot;Nobody&#39;s ever been fired for listening.&quot; »
Why don&#39;t we listen to each other?
First, we prefer to talk.
When I speak, I have control.
I don&#39;t have to hear what doesn&#39;t interest me.
I am the center of attention.
I can highlight my identity.
But it&#39;s not just that: we get distracted.
We speak an average of 225 words per minute, but can hear up to 500.
So our minds complete with 275 other words.
I know it takes effort and energy to give someone our attention, but if you don&#39;t, it&#39;s not a conversation,
but rather two people shouting hardly related sentences in the same place.
You have to listen to each other.
Stephen Covey said it very well:
“Many of us don&#39;t listen to understand.
We listen to respond. »
One last rule, number 10: be brief.
[A good conversation is like a mini-skirt: short enough to hold the attention, and long enough to cover the subject. -- My sister] It all comes down to one basic concept: take an interest in others.
I grew up with a very famous grandfather and there was a ritual in my house.
People would come and talk to my grandparents and after they left, my mom would come up to us and say, “You know who that was?
She was the Miss America runner-up.
It was the mayor of Sacramento.
She won a Pulitzer Prize. He is a Russian ballet dancer. »
So I grew up believing that everyone has a hidden and totally awesome side.
I think that makes me a better facilitator.
I keep my mouth shut as much as possible, I keep an open mind and I&#39;m always ready to be amazed and I&#39;m never disappointed.
Do the same.
Go talk to people, listen to them, and most importantly, be prepared to be amazed.
THANKS.
Good morning.
My name is Matthew Williams, and I&#39;m a champ.
I won medals in three different sports and national championships in Canada, played basketball internationally and was proud to represent Canada on the world stage.
I train 5 days a week in basketball and speed skating, work with top quality coaches and mental performance consultants to be the best at my sport.
Besides, I do all this with the Special Olympics.
Does this change the way you perceive me and my achievements?
The world doesn&#39;t see people like me as champions.
Not so long ago, people like me were shunned and hidden away.
Special Olympics has come a long way since its inception in 1968, but too often people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to the general public.
People use the &#39;R&#39; word with me, and they think it&#39;s okay.
It is the word &quot;retarded&quot; or &quot;backward&quot; used in a disparaging way.
They don&#39;t realize how much it hurts me and my friends.
I don&#39;t want you to think I&#39;m here for charity.
I&#39;m here because there&#39;s still a big problem with how many people view people with intellectual disabilities, or too often don&#39;t see them at all.
Did you know that the world championships took place this year?
I was among more than 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries competing in Los Angeles.
There were over 62,000 spectators at the opening ceremonies, and there was TSN and ESPN to cover the event.
Did you know this event happened?
What do you think when you meet someone like me?
I&#39;m here today to challenge you to see us as equals.
The Special Olympics are transforming the very identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the perception of anyone watching the competition.
For those of you who don&#39;t know, Special Olympics is for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
The Special Olympics are separate from the Paralympic and Olympic Games.
We provide high quality, year-round sports programs for people with developmental disabilities that change lives and perceptions.
This movement has changed my life and the lives of so many other people.
And it changed the way the world views people with intellectual disabilities.
I was born epileptic and with an intellectual disability.
Growing up, I played hockey until I was 12.
The older I got, the more I felt it was harder to keep up with others, and I got angry and frustrated.
For a while, I didn&#39;t play any sports, didn&#39;t have any friends, and felt forgotten and sad.
There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were hidden from society.
No one thought they could play a sport, let alone be an important member of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of regular exercise on the physical condition of children with intellectual disabilities.
Using rigorous scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers concluded that it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate that caused fitness problems.
Many people doubted that people with intellectual disabilities could benefit from fitness programs and sports competitions.
But pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of the Special Olympics, persevered, and Special Olympics athletes proved them right four and a half million times.
Before I joined Special Olympics, I was nervous because I was young, shy, had low self-confidence and didn&#39;t have many friends.
When I arrived, however, everyone encouraged me a lot, supported me and let me be myself without being judged.
Now I&#39;m a basketball player and speed skater who has competed at regional, national games, and this year finished at the World Summer Games in Los Angeles, where I was part of the very first team Canadian basketball to participate in the World Games.
I&#39;m one of over four and a half million athletes around the world, and I&#39;ve heard so many similar stories.
Being a Special Olympics athlete gives pride and dignity.
Special Olympics also addresses important health needs.
Studies have indicated that on average men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years younger than men without, and women with intellectual disabilities die 20 years younger than women without.
Special Olympics keeps us healthy by getting us active and participating in sport.
In addition, our coaches teach us about nutrition and health.
Special Olympics also provides free drug testing for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctor or accessing medical care.
At the 2015 World Summer Games, my teammates from Team Canada and I were playing against Team Nigeria.
The day before our game, the Nigerian basketball team had come for the scouting World Games Athletes were distributed free of charge to seven out of ten members and had the opportunity to hear clearly for the first time.
This change for them was incredible.
They were very excited, happy and confident because their coaches could communicate with them orally.
And they were very moved because they could hear the sounds of the basketball, the sounds of the whistle and the cheering fans in the stands — sounds that we take for granted.
Special Olympics do more than transform athletes in sport.
The Special Olympics are transforming their lives off the pitch.
This year, research has shown that almost half of adults in the United States do not know a single person with intellectual disabilities, and the 44% of Americans who have no personal contact with intellectual disabilities are significantly less tolerant and positive.
Then there is the “R” word, showing that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to far too many people.
People use it as a common term or an insult.
It was tweeted over nine million times last year, and it is deeply hurtful to me and my four and a half million fellow athletes around the world.
People don&#39;t think it&#39;s insulting, but it is.
As my fellow athlete and global spokesperson John Franklin Stephens wrote in an open letter to a political commentator who used the &#39;R&#39; word as an insult, “Come join us someday at Special Olympics.
You will see if you leave with an unchanged heart. »
This year at the 2015 World Summer Games, people lined up for hours before diving into the final night of weightlifting competition.
The evening was a full house when my teammate Jackie Barrett, the Newfoundland Elk, lifted 297 kg and 277 kg in squats — setting huge new Special Olympics records.
Jackie is one of the record holders among all weightlifters in Newfoundland — not just Special Olympics but all weightlifters.
Jackie was a huge celebrity in Los Angeles, and ESPN live-tweeted her new record and were impressed with her performance.
Fifty years ago, few people imagined mentally retarded people being able to do something like this.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremonies of the World Games and cheer on athletes from 165 countries from around the world.
Far from being hidden, we were applauded and celebrated.
Special Olympics teaches athletes to be confident and proud of themselves.
Special Olympics teaches the world that people with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and consideration.
Now I have dreams and successes in my sport, great coaches, respect and dignity, better health, and I am pursuing a career as a personal trainer.
I&#39;m no longer hidden, mocked, and here I am giving a TED Talk.
The world is a different place thanks to Special Olympics, but there is still work to be done.
So the next time you see someone with intellectual disabilities, I hope you see their talent.
The next time someone uses the &quot;R&quot; word next to you, I hope you tell them how hurtful it is.
I hope you will consider getting involved in Special Olympics.
I would like to leave you with one very last thought.
Nelson Mandela said: “Sport has the power to change the world. »
Special Olympics is changing the world by transforming four and a half million athletes and giving us a place to be confident, meet friends, not be judged and feel and be champions.
Thank you so much.
You probably don&#39;t know Kenema in Sierra Leone, or Arua in Nigeria.
For me these are the two most extraordinary places on Earth.
There, in the hospitals, there is a community of nurses, doctors and scientists who have calmly fought one of humanity&#39;s deadliest threats in years: the Lassa virus.
The Lassa virus resembles the Ebola virus.
It can cause high fever and can often be fatal.
But these people risk their lives every day, to protect individuals in their communities, and ultimately to protect us all.
One of the most amazing things I learned about them during one of my first visits a long time ago was that they start every morning – those tough mornings on the frontlines – with singing.
They come together, and they show their joy and their strength.
Over the years, we have visited each other. I could be among them, sing, and write. It was extraordinary, because it reminds us that we are not here only for science, but that we are linked by a shared humanity.
You can imagine it was extremely important, vital even, when things started to change.
The situation changed in March 2014, when the Ebola epidemic was declared in Guinea.
It was the first outbreak in West Africa, near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
It was scary... We were all terrified.
We had suspected for some time that Lassa and Ebola were more widespread than previously thought, that it could reach Kenema.
So members of my team immediately joined Dr. Humarr Khan and his team in the field. We have set up diagnostics to perform molecular tests capable of detecting the arrival of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
We had already succeeded in controlling the Lassa virus. We knew how to do it, the team was remarkable.
We just had to give them the tools and the lab for Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day has come.
On May 23, 2014, a woman arrived in the hospital&#39;s maternity ward. The team carried out the molecular tests and identified the first case of the Ebola virus in Sierra Leone.
It was an exceptional job.
They were able to diagnose the case immediately, treat the patient safely, and begin to understand what was going on.
It could have prevented what happened.
But the day it happened, the epidemic had been brewing for several months.
There were already hundreds of cases, surpassing all previous outbreaks.
She entered Sierra Leone, not like this singular case, but like a tidal wave.
We worked with the international community, the Ministry of Health, with Kenema, to deal with the cases. The following week there were 31, then 92, then 147 cases, they were all coming to Kenema, one of the only places in Sierra Leone that could solve this problem.
We worked tirelessly, trying everything we could to help each person, and trying to get attention. We also did something else:
we didn&#39;t throw away the blood tests, used to detect Ebola, we put them in a chemical to deactivate them. We packed them up and shipped them across the ocean.
We sent them to Boston, where my team works.
We have also worked tirelessly, day after day. We quickly generated 99 Ebola virus genomes.
The genome is the blueprint for a virus.
We all have one.
It tells us what we are made of, and gives us so much information about us.
The results of this kind of work are simple and very useful.
We took these 99 different viruses, we looked at them and compared them, and we found that, comparing them to the three genomes that had been previously published in Guinea, the epidemic had emerged in Guinea several months earlier, and that, once in humans, it was transmitted from human to human.
This is very important when determining how to intervene, because contact tracing is essential.
The virus has also been found to mutate as it moves between humans.
Each mutation is important because diagnostics, vaccines, and our therapies are all based on the sequence of the genome. It is the guide.
Global health experts need to respond, develop and re-calibrate all their work accordingly.
But science doesn&#39;t work that way. My position at the time was that I had the data and I could have worked in silos for months, analyzed the data carefully, slowly, submitted a paper for publication, made some edits, and finally published my data after publication. official.
This is how the status quo in science works.
This time, no question of doing so.
We had friends in the field. For us, it was obvious that we needed the help, a lot of help...
The first thing we did, as soon as the machine released the first sequences, was to publish them on the web.
We published them and appealed for help.
And help came!
Quickly, many people contacted us, surprised by the data we had published.
Some of the greatest infectious disease specialists in the world were part of our community.
We were working together virtually, sharing regular calls, trying to track the virus minute by minute, to see how to stop it.
There are so many ways to form such communities.
Everyone, when the epidemic started spreading globally, wanted to learn, participate, and engage.
Everyone wanted to play a role.
The number of volunteers was incredible, and the Internet connected us all.
Can you imagine that instead of being afraid of each other, we were saying, &quot;OK, let&#39;s go, working together,
we will defeat this virus. »
The problem was that the data we were using, researching the web, was too limited for our purpose.
A lot of opportunities are wasted in these cases.
So when the epidemic broke out in Kenema, we had 106 clinical records of patients, and we made them public.
In our lab, we demonstrated that, given these 106 records, we could teach our computers to predict Ebola with approximately 100% accuracy.
We have developed an application that gives access to this information to health personnel on site.
Unfortunately, 106 cases are not enough to consolidate and validate the data.
So we expected more data.
But we were still waiting for the data.
We are still waiting, confined to our silos, instead of working together.
This situation is no longer tolerable.
You, all of you, you can no longer accept this.
It is our life that is at stake.
Many people have lost their lives, health personnel, including colleagues who were dear to me. Five colleagues lost their lives: Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi, Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Koroma and Mohamed Fullah.
These are just five of many in Kenema and beyond who died as the world waited and we worked, quietly and separately.
Ebola, like all threats to humanity, is fueled by mistrust, confusion and division.
As we build barriers between us, the virus grows.
Unlike all other threats, in the face of Ebola, we are all equal.
We are all on the same boat.
Ebola is on everyone&#39;s doorstep.
And so in this place, we share the same vulnerabilities, strengths, fears and hopes, I form the wish that we can work together and with pleasure.
One of my former students was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and she discovered that the term &quot;Kenema&quot;, the hospital where we work, in Sierra Leone, comes from Mende&#39;s quote for &quot;clear as a river, translucent and open to view.
It held special meaning for us because, unknowingly, we had always believed that to honor individuals in Kenema, we needed to work openly and together.
We need to.
We must all demand of ourselves and of others, to be open to each other, when an epidemic occurs, and to fight it together.
Because this is neither the first Ebola epidemic nor the last, and there are many other pathogens lurking around us, such as the Lassa virus.
The next outbreak could hit a city of millions.
It could start there and spread through the air.
It might even be intentionally disseminated.
I know it&#39;s scary, I get it...but I also know, this experience proves it to us, that we have the technology and the capability to defeat, to defeat and get ahead of other viruses.
But this is only possible if we collaborate in joy.
For Dr Khan, and for all those who have given their lives, on the front line, in this fight with us, let us be with them in this fight. Always.
Let&#39;s not leave the world the stigma of the destruction caused by a virus. Let us illuminate it with the brilliance of billions of hearts and minds working in unity.
THANKS.
