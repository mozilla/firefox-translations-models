At the end of the exchanges, the Prague stock exchange fell into the negative
After Tuesday morning&#39;s fall, the Prague Stock Exchange rectified its losses.
Trading in ČEZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily trading.
On Tuesday, when trading began, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed its fall of the previous day, when it lost almost six percent.
This time around, the drop is due to falling stocks on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the stabilization plan for the American financial sector, is thus also perceptible here.
Stocks fall in Asia
The Asian stock markets experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even if the indices succeeded, during the day, in erasing part of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange&#39;s Hang Seng Index lost four percent during trading, but later erased some of the losses and narrowed the decline to almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index following the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 percent as markets closed in Shanghai.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange were down more than five percent, but eventually managed to narrow the loss to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
&quot;The hesitation over bailout action in the US will affect financial markets around the world,&quot; observed Joseph Yam, the head of the Hong Kong Currency Board.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, that is to say independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US lawmakers should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will suffer the consequences.
The bloodbath in US equities
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the project to support the financial system, to which it should have devoted up to 700 billion dollars (nearly 12 trillion Kč).
The lawmakers thus rejected the call for support for President George Bush&#39;s plan.
According to Bush, the project should resolve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
US equities experienced a bloodbath on Monday and the main equity indices suffered the biggest drop in 20 years.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly seven percent, having last suffered such a large drop in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal did not pass, it was in free fall.
Congress gave in: the US government can inject $700 billion into the banks
The leaders of the United States Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of the agreement for financial assistance to the American financial system.
It will be put to the vote early next week.
U.S. lawmakers reached a turning point in talks on the adoption of a bailout package in the form of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns) in financial aid to the U.S. financial system .
Success is by no means certain.
Indeed, before being able to publish the final version of the law and put it to the vote, the Congressmans must finish a certain number of details of the agreement.
The plan to support the financial system will be examined Monday in the House of Representatives.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Regulation Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should a priori be put to a vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should constitute a first major psychological factor in reviving the financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market support can be effective, &quot;disillusionment&quot; will follow.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made great progress.
We&#39;ve settled our differing opinions about what form the market stabilization package should take,&quot; Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could be taken as early as Sunday.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of the legislators met with the American Treasury Minister Henry Paulson, in order to give the bottom of the government a final form.
The latter should buy back, from the financial companies, the unsaleable real estate assets which involve the financial companies in considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
“We are about to agree on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
We still have to pursue this market recovery plan, but I think we&#39;re there,&quot; said Paulson.
A signal for Asian exchanges
The global financial crisis is having a huge impact on falling equity markets.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are working to get Congress to reach a final agreement on Sunday.
They want to calm investors before the start of trading in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the decision of Congress could affect Monday&#39;s trading.
However, for the moment, it is impossible to specify with certainty when the two Chambers of the American Congress will proceed to the vote, nor if the negotiations are not likely to remain blocked, at the last moment, by such and such a problem.
Lawmakers hope it will pass in the coming days.
However, the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount intended for using the system should be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
But if Congress feels the program is not doing its job, it has the option of blocking the remaining amount, following two steps: first an additional $100 billion, and then, finally, $350 billion.
Bush hailed progress in negotiations
Although the president can veto this decision, Congress has the option of putting him in a minority.
Despite these modifications, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain finance for the purchase of bad real estate titles, the value of which fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
&quot;All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday,&quot; said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President George Bush is himself pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated &quot;the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.&quot;
Limitation of Golden Parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, says lawmakers have agreed on accountability for the financial program, protecting contributors from losses, agreeing tax breaks, rolling out the plan on the time axis.
The new law also plans to limit the said golden parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the program and it establishes a committee, which will ensure the supervision of the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on this and have made significant progress toward an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also includes help for property owners who have problems paying.
The government should negotiate new down payments for mortgages it will buy back, while lowering monthly payments to debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its realization will be very difficult.
“And this is due to the fact that it is not known what the mechanism and the price of the redemption of the problem assets will be.
This point will be decisive in deciding on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government,&quot; Marek told the iHNed.cz server this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, is, according to Marek, not that important.
“It is much more important that Congressmen agree, starting this week, that they support this plan and that they will enshrine it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, matters most at this time,&quot; Marek pointed out.
Right-wing populists triumph in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to the preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current grand coalition, as well as a notable strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People&#39;s Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly heavy losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at the national level.
According to the preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 percent of the votes, the first political force in the country, however, compared with the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 percent of the votes.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent lost almost nine percent of the vote, finished even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; especially for the People&#39;s Party, which called the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable lead over the SPÖ.
But voters visibly chastised them for allowing the government to collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculation about the possible resignation of the party leader and the current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer, was pronounced.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday, during the extraordinary council of the party leadership.
Such a development would a priori facilitate the path towards the outcome of the election which remains the most probable, namely the renewal of the grand coalition SPÖ and ÖVP.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Free (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 percent and BZÖ eleven percent of the vote - the Socialists at the same time expressed the fear of a repetition of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ broke away from it) on a common government, which even provoked sanctions from the European Union .
Haider, who has already declared that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he foresees the return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently is banking on this development.
The last party to gain access to parliament was the Greens, but they lost slightly and fell, among Austrian political parties, from third to fifth position.
Obviously, no other party crossed the four percent limit and entered parliament.
A fight taken to the extreme: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you how to choose
While almost all mobiles can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
It seems to follow clearly that it is better to buy only a phone.
Still, there are enough reasons to get a standalone player.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy an expensive top-of-the-range gramophone for the house to play Maxim Turbulenc&#39;s new album.
On the one hand, such musical products are not released on vinyl, and, from a quality point of view, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
However, if there are vinyl records piled up in your shelves, with art rock, jazz or blues, you at least probably dream of such a gramophone.
The same applies to music on the go, namely compressed music, to put it simply - music in MP3.
Again, there are categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, in the same way that a fan of Pink Floyd would find it hard to stomach earphones bought for twenty crowns at the market.
Here are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Battery life is also decisive
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are functions that are, of course, unknown to most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the telephone.
Alongside the primary functions, telephone calls and sending SMS, it is capable of playing music and films, of recording the latter, it has a camera of variable quality and can, for example, up to to be used for navigation.
And if we take into account Smartphones and communicators, you will have in your pocket a small computer.
Since no refrigerator knows how to grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are practically witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without drawbacks.
The greater the number of functions you use, the more the interval between two reloads will be reduced.
And reading music is one of the biggest energy guzzlers.
Mobiles capable of playing music for ten to twelve hours are rare, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this regard, music players (especially the most rudimentary ones) are much more efficient.
In the case of cheap mobiles, count that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you happen to call from time to time, get, to be sure, a second recharge for work - this is valid even for more expensive devices.
This problem will not arise for MP3 players, which are capable, following a reload, of continuous operation for at least 9 hours, including the less efficient ones.
Another problem occurs while saving music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices have a universal USB connector, especially since not all of them can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
You can, of course, record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to do it without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of the memory cards used in mobiles.
With regard to the readers, you do not need, except exception (iPod), any software.
Simply fill the device with music from the computer through the USB connector.
Most mobiles and readers will themselves create a media library classified according to the name of the performer, the title of the album, the style, or else according to the judgment of the user.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, like Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles have more know-how
In choosing a specific device, you are particularly interested in the life of the battery, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of order.
If music is essentially background noise for you and if during the day you are only going to listen to it for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile that plays MP3s.
Virtually all mobiles are capable of this today.
You don&#39;t even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or the player is capable of playing.
They all manage to read MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will be in this format.
It is one of the most popular formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also play WMA format music.
AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods), meanwhile, is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
All you have to do is visit, from your mobile phone, the corresponding web pages of the operator (or those of another provider) and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to get a music mobile.
The offer of the operators is unfortunately miserable and it is limited, in the majority of the cases, to radio tubes quickly made.
The prices aren&#39;t the lowest either.
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether by mobile phone, internet or even wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobile with them.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you just have to take the mobile out of your pocket, when you forgot your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have headphones or a handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in speakers, which practically all mobiles have, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of music mobiles is their price.
The cheapest normally cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand crowns, one can have an already very decent Walkman.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the lack of output for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best and best equipped telephones, also provided with an input for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of easy ordering.
Really anyone manages to ensure the control of the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the control&#39;s resemblance to that of a cassette player, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a randomly plugged in mobile internet, followed by an immense data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (eg Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models basically only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive even manage with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, choose specialized walkman mobiles instead (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and this is how the ease of control approaches that of a freestanding MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman series mobiles have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that has gone the furthest in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by a MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering practically the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we are still missing something - a virtual operator, which would force traditional operators to lower prices.
He may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned, many times, on Mobil.cz the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The ČTÚ (Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher here than in the rest of the Union, has also confirmed this.
Thus, following the latest steps of the European Commission in the field of the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper for some customers of Czech mobile operators than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks a competition that would really like to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that greatly exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvořák, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), who has repeatedly declared that in the Czech Republic there is no longer any place for another operator, agrees with the operators.
It is probably true that a traditional operator with his own network apparently does not have much luck (by the way, now he would hardly find frequencies).
Now, there is still one possibility - a virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that led to a considerable drop in prices, to which the traditional operators were subsequently also to react.
Yet even before spoilsports such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market, voices similar to those we hear at home today were being heard in Britain.
However, it appeared that there was still room for such operators and that they could have real success.
We don&#39;t have to look too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch, in Poland, of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator has managed to win more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Let&#39;s add that behind Mobilking, there is the Penta financial group, which owns, among other things, U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators being the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be efficient, they indeed need far fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the costs of building, operating and maintaining the mobile network, which are relatively high.
This is how in the world, virtual operators profile themselves as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half the price of its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity stunt.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
&quot;Real men choose Mobilking - a carrier they like and can trust,&quot; says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operator of this virtual carrier.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept would also work here.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone&#39;s spokesman, doubts: &quot;The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services.&quot;
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
&quot;We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in Czechia the negotiations are not very promising.
The launch of Mobilking will instead take place in other countries in our zone,&quot; Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group, said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favor of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible so that a potential competitor cannot appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of business customers, has not hidden, for quite a long time, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
&quot;We are very keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile ones.
And the sooner the better.
We have already conducted negotiations about this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we managed to make progress in the negotiations,&quot; said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
The future may therefore be promising.
According to unofficial information, it looks like we might be able to welcome the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for now, its creation is accompanied by complete silence.
&quot;At the moment we do not believe there is room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with other very specific.
At the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us,&quot; mentioned Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefonika O2, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also relate to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová says in a rare agreement with O2&#39;s statement: &quot;We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally beneficial project, which could serve as a basis.&quot;
And she adds: &quot;It is practically impossible that a virtual operator will appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited time frame, we should have a concrete agreement now.&quot;
Vodafone is instead directing its attention to fulfilling requests to obtain its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says in relation to this: &quot;We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the field of shared costs and infrastructure.
This is what we believe means the most input from a customer perspective.
Vodafone&#39;s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to set up a common network for fast mobile internet.&quot;
The responsible authorities: in tune with the operators
The approach of the mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a drop in prices and therefore a drop in their profit.
So why facilitate the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to get along like thieves at a fair. The quibble accompanying the creation of the U:fon also bears witness to this.
The greatest apparent pressure on the ČTÚ, during the creation of the U:fon, was that exerted by the company T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the ČTÚ web pages.
However, today, U:fon lends itself to being used as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová commented on this: &quot;Competition in the mobile market has also recently been amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would place high demands on it, and especially its services.&quot;
But given the attitude of mobile operators here, the indifference of Czech regulators seems disconcerting.
However, it is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ, which, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
This belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
However, the latter adopted, faced with this problem, his typical position.
&quot;The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No agreement of this type has been concluded for the moment, because the offer of the potential interested parties did not a priori present sufficient interest for the traditional operators,&quot; specified in answer to our question Kristián Chalupa from the Department of external relations of the ÚOHS.
A statement formulated in this way would not come as a surprise on the part of operators&#39; representatives.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and among other things also take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, such a statement is more than confusing.
Especially since Kristián Chalupa adds: &quot;Abroad, where virtual operators are normally present, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to a drop in the prices of mobile telephone services.&quot;
However, pushing for an honest functioning of the market and lower prices is apparently not in the interests of the ÚOHS.
What is indeed shocking is the almost touching harmony of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, arises quite naturally.
In the same way, a strictly identical price of gasoline at all service stations is surely due to chance and the hard fight of competition.
“The office has not found any signs of anti-competitive behavior in this regard, so it has no reason to intervene in one way or another.
None of the operators has a dominant position, none therefore has a correspondingly increased responsibility for its behavior on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably lacking even the telecommunications regulator,&quot; Chaloupa said in his statement.
One of the many points of contention is the interpretation of market dominance.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets prepared by the ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts propose another view of things: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained each time.
And the mobile operator quite logically has a monopoly on its network.
This is how he necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of his activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators obviously proceed in a similar way.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including the company GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Placing the blame on the ČTÚ is a fairly common trick in communications, by means of which the ÚOHS washes its hands of the matter.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Regrettably, the recently adopted novelization of the telecommunications law did not succeed in enacting an extension of the powers of the ČTÚ in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised an improvement in the situation.
This, the representatives of the ÚOHS must know very well, but their interests apparently lie elsewhere.
When no one is watching, it can work
However, the operation of a kind of pseudo-virtual operators, several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile phone services, but these are only partly public.
In most cases, it is a question of firms dealing with multi-level marketing.
Specialized mobile telephone services are thus offered by, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms generally only reach elected officials.
The magic trick consists in the fact that the company acts in front of the operator as a classic corporate customer, who orders a large quantity of SIM cards.
As a major customer, she gets special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
&quot;If what you mention happened, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would examine and which could lead to a cessation of the collaboration with the company in question,&quot; answered our question relating to this problem Martina Kemrová.
However, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such activity did not reach the heads of mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers.
No operator, however, is against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them non-negligible benefits, and, at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický indicates the possible problems: &quot;The law allows such speculations, nevertheless, the services of these companies are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, like ordinary customers of mobile operators.
Now, this is precisely what should seem strange to the ČTÚ.
In addition, another question arises at the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to such a procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has relatively broad powers to be able to reveal such an activity, and if it does not wish to content itself with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibiting it .
When we will no longer be the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a considerable drop in the price of services.
However, practically in all the countries where virtual operators appeared, the traditional operators tried, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - too small or even too saturated a market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that regulatory bodies in developed countries have intervened, defending not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Both through formal measures and through informal pressure, they ended up obtaining the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators treat this issue like a hot potato that gets rid of by passing it on to a nearby target.
From the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that the confusion in competences is in these cases more than profitable to them.
But let&#39;s not throw the handle after the ax.
If the behind-the-scenes information is correct and a virtual operator will soon appear on our premises, the Czech mobile market may be on the move again.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the ÚOHS to remain impassive in the face of rejection (discrimination) from other interested parties.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four performances of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the National Theater Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo vocal, a performance with choir and an instrumental version.
Vocals are provided by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the arrangements of the anthem.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful anthems.
As he had previously entrusted to Český rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of the solo versions of the singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
&quot;From the beginning, I tried to take care that the two singers, as well as the choir, have good diction, so that we understand the lyrics well, that they sing simultaneously,&quot; he said. -He specifies.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj resounded for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the Estates Theatre) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des cobblers), an original Czech play by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by František Škroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously adopted it.
After the creation of Czechoslaovakia in 1918, the first verse naturally became part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the &quot;new&quot; anthem sound
Prague public transport (MHD) will introduce the chip in its ticketing system on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will go down in the history of the Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Prague Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers board the metro, trams and buses, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latter is accessible to about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day or 90-day coupon (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both have it registered on their smart card at information points and Dopravní podnik offices (l Transport Agency), located at Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy coupons online on the web pages of Dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people enjoyed the service during the morning.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget about ticket counters in metro stations, where until now they had to stomp impatiently in long queues in order to obtain paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon on the internet and it will be registered on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
&quot;In these touchpoints, passengers have a counter with trained staff, who will help those interested in purchasing via the internet and, in addition, will register the coupon they have purchased on their card,&quot; says project spokesperson Martin Opatrný.
Alongside the libraries, it will also be possible to register electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these dispensers look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket punching machines, and passengers may have already noticed them at Roztyly, Budějovická, IP Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
&quot;Today the city has five, but by the end of the year there should be eighty,&quot; Opatrný added.
An automaton will check the coupon instead of the driver
The automatons which will operate from tomorrow are easy to use.
Simply insert the Opencard smart card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also around the city.
Namely in suburban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia to access the capital.
&quot;In trains integrated in Pražská integrovaná doprava (Prague integrated transport), conductors are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of coupons;&quot; explained ticket control Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization, which designs Prague public transport timetables.
Suburban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver&#39;s body.
When boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard in the place indicated on the side of the cash desk.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
&quot;In case the passenger needs to check the validity of the saved coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information,&quot; Drápal completed.
Passengers who do not take the suburban buses and will not remember the date when the validity of their coupon expires, can rejoin the vending machines, initially used to register the coupons on the card.
It is there, on the screen of the device, that the information concerning the validity of their document will be displayed.
The Sudetenland demanded a referendum in the USA
The Sudeten Germans demanded in 1945 that Šumava be integrated into the United States.
This follows from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of South Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we at least want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, certain groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly approached the President of the United States with such a desire.
This stems, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
Germans from Český Krumlov pray in the letter to the US President not to allow &quot;šumavská župa&quot; (region of forests in southern Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
&quot;We understand the situation well and want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that American troops are coming to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,&quot; is written in the letter, signed &quot;Persons, to whom the fate of Šumava is close to heart&quot;.
Since joining Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - nothing but brutality, callousness, incomprehension, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the President American to take in his hands the protectorate of Šumava for now and forever.
&quot;We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a State foreign to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and which has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies without taking into consideration the opinion of the quarter of a million inhabitants ,&quot; is written in the letter.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the &quot;Czech oppressors&quot;.
If the President of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans of Šumava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given current knowledge of post-war history, appear somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it does illustrate the expectations of the Sudeten Germans of the time.
While the Czech Germans should at least foresee that the question of their expulsion from the republic will arise, very few of them admit to such a possibility.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would obtain for the Sudetenland some type of autonomy.
Others believed they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German from České Budějovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the English and placed in the capture camp in the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to teach them Czech.
&quot;They believed that when they got back home, the Czech would benefit them,&quot; says Chalupa.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed, according to him, that, following the Beneš Decrees, they would be expelled from the republic.
You don&#39;t think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
Costliest road safety action in Czech history.
A way of characterizing the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček believes that it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behavior.
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from fast driving and drink-driving.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
Above all, it wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack the emotions.
This is also evidenced by the &quot;bloody&quot; slogan of the entire campaign:
You don&#39;t think - you pay!
The phrase &quot;You don&#39;t think&quot; is written in capital letters on the license plate.
Then, in a pool of blood, there is the phrase &quot;You will pay&quot;.
This must symbolize that one can pay with life for a moment of inattention.
The spots will &quot;haunt&quot; viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can commonly see images with drastic images of accident victims.
He believes this will lead to a drop in the accident rate and death toll on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The strategy of sugar and whip against drivers
&quot;What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time when they run a red light.
Whipping is the threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers need to be reminded of the risks,&quot; says Martin Kořán, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative publicity, believes the psychologist.
Signs signaling the danger to drivers are, according to him, already less effective.
&quot;When a static sign that warns of danger is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and drivers won&#39;t notice it anymore,&quot; Kořán pointed out.
Olmert would return in exchange for peace almost all the occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the president of Israel&#39;s provisional government, spoke out in favor of returning virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made the statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
&quot;We have to come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all the (occupied) territories, if not all of them,&quot; Olmert told the daily.
&quot;We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to cede a similar percentage (of Israeli territory) to the Palestinians, since without that there will be no peace,&quot; he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
&quot;Whoever desires safety in Jerusalem, and above all does not desire tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem,&quot; Olmert remarked in referring to the two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find &quot;a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places&quot; located inside the Old City.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won&#39;t work,&quot; he pointed out afterwards.
Retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also came out in favor of Israel&#39;s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
&quot;I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a retreat from the Golan Heights,&quot; he pointed out.
&quot;The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They are going to have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to give up the constant support they give to the terrorism of Hamas (Shiite movement), Al-Kaeda (terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (holy war) in Iraq,&quot; specified the Prime Minister .
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are likely to cool
Failure to resolve the issue of accused Czech researchers in India for illegal cockroach picking would, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, lead to a certain cooling of Czech-Czech relations. Indian.
The minister said so today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
&quot;If the problem was not solved, then yes, a certain cooling would occur,&quot; he noted after the meeting, carried out following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, coming out of the talks, that the executive branch could hardly intervene in court cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was cleared of the charge and punished with a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the case being placed under the jurisdiction of the latter. this.
&quot;His problem could be solved,&quot; said the minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
From then on, he could ask for bail and wait for the judgment in freedom, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner spoke in the same direction also during the talks.
&quot;He advises to appeal to a higher court, following which he could be pardoned,&quot; said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicts with &quot;competent legal support&quot;, mentioned the Indian minister.
He also says that such help was already given to them also from India.
“Above all, we wish to maintain the best relations with India, which have a tradition that continues over many years.
The Indians also recognize it,&quot; Schwarzenberg pointed out.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed in front of his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem that had arisen with Czech entomologies.
&quot;We regard the incarceration and prosecution of these Czech researchers as a big mistake,&quot; he said.
The minister dodged the question if he got India&#39;s promise to handle the case.
&quot;I&#39;ve already received quite a number of promises,&quot; he noted only.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are the stewards in the coach illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long-distance bus is prohibited
In the context of the tragic accident of the Student Agency coach near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can move around inside the coach during the journey.
&quot;If one wanted to respect the law strictly and formally, the activity of a steward is against the law on road traffic,&quot; said spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess perished, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck which crossed the path of the bus.
The young girl was at this time unfortunately seated next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
However, the coach can have an accident, or even brake suddenly, also when the steward is serving coffee or distributing newspapers.
What matters is whether the coach is according to its specifications equipped with standing room or not.
If this standing equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
Student Agency long-distance coaches do not have standing room; which was confirmed to Aktuálně.cz by company director Radim Jančura.
&quot;It&#39;s a matter that we have discussed with the ministry and initially they are banning any movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got that passengers can go to the toilet during the trip as long as they have their own seat,&quot; he revealed his position.
The law ignores the steward
&quot;There is no unambiguous legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal prescription deals with this role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement prohibits the carrier from offering services either.
The law on road transport knows only the term receiver of the vehicle; it does not define his rights and duties,&quot; adds spokesman Hanzelka more ambiguously.
Josef Pokorný, the director of the road vehicle traffic department, believes, on the contrary, that the law sufficiently addresses the problem.
&quot;It all depends on whether the coach has standing room permission in its homologation.
It&#39;s all in there,&quot; he said.
Coaches are divided into city, where there is standing room and a limited maximum speed, intercity with standing room and a higher permitted speed, and long-distance coaches with no standing room with the highest permitted maximum speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Hořín, an expert at BESIP (road traffic safety) in transport safety, does not see the displacement of on-board stewards as a major problem.
&quot;During regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in airplanes.
Again, it&#39;s not sure when turbulence will occur and the stewardess may bump her head.&quot;
“However, in the event that the coach had braked suddenly, the laws of physics would obviously apply.
In the same way as in an urban bus or in a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the stewards by internal prescriptions,” he says and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not settled.
Jančura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only coach carrier to offer steward services.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their job as a risky job.
“Nevertheless, as soon as I feel it is a risky job, I will delete it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper upon boarding.
It would also lower costs,&quot; he said.
The concern for security is the reason given by the director of the Asiana Alexeï Litvine for the absence of stewards in his vehicles, which provides, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
&quot;We don&#39;t have hostesses. We&#39;ve been against it from the start.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident,&quot; he told Týden.cz a year ago.
A huge tragedy has happened
A young stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the company for two years, died in the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the hard shoulder without using a turn signal and blocked the way to the coach.
The driver of the latter tried to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he grazed him on his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards have been sold.
&quot;In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked.&quot;
The company intends to file a complaint against the driver of the truck.
For the compensation of the family of the young girl, the agency will not wait for the judgment of the court, but with regard to the financial compensation, it also counts on the culprit.
A change in the law?
Not in sight
A modification of the law, which has been in the process of being drawn up for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide clarification as to the movements of the stewards on board the coach.
“However, it did not come to any conclusion on this point.
To tell the truth, she is not so interested in buses, but rather in the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones while driving,&quot; says expert Hořín.
&quot;The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards as something that would fundamentally jeopardize the safety of passengers,&quot; concludes spokesman Hanzelka, specifying that the control of coach safety is under the power of the police and the office for occupational safety.
A Czech arbitrates the fight for the bottom of the sea
He approaches an electronic wall map, on which is represented Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
&quot;The island belongs to Australia, as does the adjacent seabed.
Yet this area is as big as the continent itself,&quot; said Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the 30-member team of the UN&#39;s division for oceans and law of the sea affairs.
Its head, the director of the division, the Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and supplements it from time to time.
Hard work and enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a world little known until now, rich in natural resources.
One can find there oil, ores and other mineral resources, but also living organisms for the moment unknown, which can hold the key for the development of a drug against cancer.
A bottom larger than the mainland
Coastal states have now begun to yearn vehemently for new underwater territories.
According to a UN convention, they indeed use their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is above all the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
The latter can, according to the agreement, exclusively claim all the resources of the continental shelf.
&quot;To simplify, the continental shelf is considered to be the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the littoral sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles which represent the said exclusive economic yone”, explains Mikulka.
The request that the country in question presents to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf, must be supported by extensive scientific-technical documentation, based on many costly surveys and measurement.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
“One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
So far, the commission has dealt with five requests, those from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful,&quot; adds Mikulka.
The success of Australia, which is the first to have considerably expanded its underwater possessions, has recently had worldwide repercussions.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the extent of the seabed, which the commission assigned to it last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometers, which is the extent of the country multiplied by six .
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in surveys.
The benefit they will derive in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will be, as they project, inestimable.
Gradually, other countries will, in turn, present their request.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the &quot;Montego Bay Convention&quot;.
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the zone of the ocean floor, proclaimed by convention &quot;common heritage of humanity&quot;.
There, no state enjoys an exclusive position.
The right to extract in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
&quot;Nevertheless, make no mistake, the seabed is not a Klondike,&quot; exaggerates director Mikulka, adding that &quot;its areas are precisely defined and their regime anchored in a contract&quot;.
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other States of the ex-bloc of Eastern countries within the framework of the common organization &quot;Interoceanmetal&quot;.
This one obtained in 1991, under the terms of the convention, as well as investors of some other States, the statute of that which one calls “a pioneer investor”.
It has mining rights in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is hectic, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
“It is possible to mine there over an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” lists Ind Pakshi Rajan, another jurist.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such concretion.
It recalls a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfers rest on Frankfurt.
Big words were not lacking in the letter sent by the WestLB steering committee to the employees of the house.
By a union of the entities of the financial institute of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, &quot;the central institution of the financial markets of the financial group of Sparkasse&quot; could be constituted, according to the letter made public on Monday.
WestLB would bring a &quot;skill block&quot; coupled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be the decisive kick-off towards other concentrations in the Länder banking sector.
This is what it looks like when a management board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because WestLB, injured, is still under great pressure.
It was not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority which only recently made it clear to the Land Government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time was running out in the search for a future solution.
However, there has been talk for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side - of a relationship of some form between the Deka bank, which knows the customers of Sparkasse through their investment funds, and WestLB.
Admittedly, the head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas made it known during the presentation of the figures for the half-year at the end of August that he saw no sense in the merger of the house in Mainzer Landstrasse with a Land bank, whether it be the Helaba or WestLB.
However, the board of directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported both by the banks of the Länder and by the groups of savings banks, has instructed the management committee to conduct talks with WestLB with a view to joint commercial activities. .
It could then be the debit of the financial market, or parts of it.
The talks have only just started, however, it is said in the financial center.
This is not the first time that Deta-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the largest employers in the Frankfurt financial center, has come into play when it comes to consolidating the banking sector. savings banks.
In 2003 it was believed for a while that the Deta-Bank could merge with the bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinate and the Halbab.
However, nothing came out of this ternary bouquet.
No sooner had the plans been made public than the government of the Land of Hesse decided against any participation of Hellaba in them.
Subsequently, the other two houses did not come together either.
The Land Bank of Rhineland Palatinate was attached instead to the Land Bank of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new negotiations on the merger of the Deka-Bank with the banks of the Länder.
Finally, Günther Merl, chairman of Hellaba&#39;s board of directors, however spoke out against any commercial strategy of merging with his bank.
Irrespective of this, the feeling seems to be spreading that the consolidation of the various establishments of the public sector is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Bavarian Land Parliament has passed, a union of BayernLB with the bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg could materialize first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure which forces new mergers were to increase, the possible partners escape him little by little.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it has so far withstood the crisis better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The group of savings banks and transfers of Hesse-Thuringia, which owns 85 percent of the capital of Helaba, on the other hand pulled a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB.
If necessary, the NordLB would remain.
However, such geo-strategic reflections only reflect one of the facets.
Another facet raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can fit together.
In June, Merl declared that the decisive question, namely by means of which business model the future capacity of the banks of the Länder should be ensured, had not so far been resolved by the German association of savings banks and transfers.
Eventually, a cutting up of the WestLb could take place, a cutting up which here is obviously not desired.
This is also what is discussed in the letter from the current executive committee: in any case, a &#39;global solution&#39; for the establishment would be aimed at.
How all this will be lumped together with the union of certain entities with Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second Oktoberfest weekend is also known as the weekend of the Italians.
For Elena it&#39;s the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena goes with him as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, next to a five-litre barrel of Kaiser brand beer, stands a well-built bearded man who shows around 200 Oktoberfest visitors what deep sounds his throat can produce.
Elena first hits Luca, then kisses him.
From Bologna they came as far as Verona.
From there, from the bus station near Puorta nueva station, four buses depart tonight at 11:45 p.m., `destinazione Monaco, festa della birra&#39;, arrival expected at 6:30 a.m.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses travel exclusively Brazilians.
In a corner of the car park, the South Americans are singing in gold and already next to their flag, they have already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it is not for the Italians.
The buses are owned by Marco, who wears a long faux fur-lined coat and wide-rimmed silver glasses.
For five years, they have been going to the Oktoberfest, already three trips this year alone.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and come back at 10:30 p.m.
Spending the night there would involve unnecessary costs, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome drink with a Kaiser beer, brewed according to the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a German-speaking group leader - Marco did a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses are driving in the night on the Autostrada direction `Brennero&#39;.
There&#39;s no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes calm in the bus, the travelers are asleep.
It&#39;s better that way, they will still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian license plates are once again taking a break shortly before Munich, on Autobahn 8.
When in the early morning, Marco&#39;s group finally arrives at six-thirty as planned in the parking lot near Place Thérèse, almost 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First: wear the little yellow cap.
Above is written on the left &#39;Beer Festival&#39;, in Gothic, and next to it the internet address of Marco&#39;s travel agency &#39;conoscersiviaggiando.it&#39;.
Second: &#39;When the doors of the beer tent open, we run&#39;, shouts Marco in the early morning.
&#39;Run!&#39; Run and reserve places at the bottom of the tent.
&#39;Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, we have to distribute them in the room!&#39;
The mug, shouts Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don&#39;t forget the deposit!
`Show the security guards that we behave!
As soon as you leave your seats, they are gone!&#39;
Third: &#39;Tonight, to be back here at half past ten sharp!&#39; Understood ?
And that&#39;s it, it&#39;s off to the Oktoberfest.
On the way, someone ties yellow caps to trees to find the way, to signs and even to an election poster of a major Bavarian people&#39;s party.
We want to be ready for the return.
It&#39;s the second Oktoberfest weekend, known as the &#39;weekend of the Italians&#39;.
There are no exact figures; there is talk of 50,000 setting off across the Alps and collapsing in the beer kiosk, 10 percent of visitors are said to have come from Italy on purpose this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tirol, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross which compiles statistics on the countries where the Italians occupy the first place ahead of the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (approximately 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by Italians is the Hofbräu brewery tent.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, insisted the Federal Minister of Finance only a few weeks ago.
How lucky that the politician used the word &#39;relatively&#39; and slipped in that the German banking sector would not be spared from the crisis movements.
This actually happened this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed on the DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a loan of one billion to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person inside the situation told Reuters on Monday that aid credits are issued up to an amount of 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate would now have to pay interest on the fraction to which it would thus be entitled.
The money comes as much from private banks as from banks under public law.
In the background, it is the daughter company Depfa which bears the losses.
The state financier had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced itself at very short notice for long-term projects for which it had borrowed money - which is no longer possible due to mistrust of the steps.
In the first half of 2008, the bank&#39;s liquidity reserve had been reduced by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, the equity ratio had also weakened slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Ongoing profits and net profits from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the same period the previous year, profits from the allocation of receivables and specific securities as well as the termination of provisions in credit transactions had fallen by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
And it is only thanks to the large profits from the reimbursement of downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for companies in Konzern that the earnings shortfall of about 16 percent turned out to be moderate.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financier had initially badly speculated on industrial property loans, which had then been transferred to the Aareal bank.
Because traditional state financing was not profitable enough, Depfa then committed itself more intensely to infrastructure projects and to the financing of joint projects between private investors and the State (Privat-Public-Partnership , PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the daughter company, the Hypo Real Estate must carry out amortizations which should have an essential material effect on the calculation of the gains and losses of the group which nevertheless remains rather vague.
The fact is that dividends have been cut.
Already for 2007, they had been truncated by two thirds.
Hypo Real Estate is, since the takeover of Depfa, a highly significant state and infrastructure investor.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing on the inter-bank market since it does not have any customer deposits.
With the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, inter-bank lending has again dried up significantly as banks have hoarded their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a part - around 50 billion euros - of all the credits of the Depfa of a short-term means of refinancing.
According to a press release from Hypo Real Estate, the group&#39;s financing needs are covered with medium-term credit and the company is protected from the influence of the international financial markets, which is currently largely out of order.
Other sources say that refinancing would be secured with the funds until the end of 2009.
The chairman of the board of directors of HRE Georg Funke explained, on the other hand, that the Hypo Real Estate group should no longer have to resort to the financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institution for the Supervision of Financial Services (Bafin) assume that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Group is now assured.
The bank&#39;s shareholders and creditors can only hope so.
However, given the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Moreover, it is not unthinkable that financing should not be used to its full extent.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest press releases, still on the verge of insolvency late Sunday evening, this rescue, to say the least, will not succeed in reassuring people&#39;s minds either.
The share price fell 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are doing particularly well.
While first-tier debt has barely moved, second-tier loan prices are falling.
The most affected are above all the investment funds of the former daughter company Württemberg Hypo and those of course which have a lifespan beyond 2009.
Hypo Real Estate bank bonds previously seemed to be an alternative speculative investment, now their value must be seen as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the sharp hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the very institute which brought the crisis into the establishment through the takeover of the Depfa bank.
As long as issuing institutions, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that the arrears will be cleared over time.
Either will happen what no one dares to hope for now - that the financial crisis can be overcome within the next 15 months.
But in the face of renewed rumors of partial nationalization, the probability that was approaching safety has now become a mere justified hope.
This should reserve sleepless nights above all for long-term creditors on the decision of whether to part with their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they have drawn a line to build up a carryforward of losses for the next few years on the next automatically levied stock market gains capital income tax.
German special forces were on hand to free the hostages
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units stood ready but they never acted.
More and more details of the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are coming to light.
According to information from the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, German special forces also indirectly participated in the rescue operation.
Thus, as many specialists of the federal army as officials of the GSG 9, the air squadron of the federal police and the federal office of criminal police, as well as experts in logistics of the Technischen Hilfwerk were on the spot of liberation.
As the spokesman for the Ministries communicated on Monday evening, the German forces were not ultimately required, the hostage takers having freed their prisoners and having fled when they recognized the imminence of a release by the strength.
The Egyptian government would have accepted the aid offered by Germany to integrate it on the spot as a support force.
&quot;Fortunately, it hasn&#39;t come that far,&quot; said a spokesman for the Federal Interior Ministry.
The attackers had kidnapped in the south of Egypt the group of tourists composed of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian guides.
After their abduction in the desert in southern Egypt, the hostages were transported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers has so far remained vague, as have details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who were rescued have meanwhile arrived safe and sound in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin for the moment, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine &quot;Bild&quot;, the five holidaymakers and the special forces should have taken off on board an Airbus of the air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to show up for the first day at Tachibana Highschool, the girls start giggling: the German girl is so &quot;kawaii&quot;!
What does it mean ?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Log of exchanges, she speaks about Japan.
&quot;The first day of classes in Japan.
How excited I was.
Already the way to go to school scared me.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the way on my own, luckily I didn&#39;t get lost.
The start of classes does not seem to be fixed as strictly as with us in Lower Saxony.
The students appear one after the other from eight o&#39;clock, until at twenty minutes to nine, a round of the table begins with the teacher, the &quot;home room&quot;.
But before class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I&#39;m not at all the type to like speaking in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn&#39;t have the school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my host mother, as well as a shirt, blue knee-high socks and black leather shoes.
In this outfit, I presented myself in front of the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: &#39;Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...&#39; - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all hushed, giggled and waved, and I kept hearing the word &quot;Kawaii.&quot;
I already knew him from my manga.
It belongs to the vocabulary essential to the survival of Japanese teenagers and means &quot;cute, cabbage&quot;.
Then I quickly slipped into my seat.
The girl next to me gave me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent had to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong rang I was properly mobbed.
Everyone was talking to each other, giggling and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it&#39;s quite difficult to understand Japanese English.
During the break, they all took out their Bentos.
My host mother also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it&#39;s really different from the miserable German snacks.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruits and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things look weird and taste completely new.
What is certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the candied salted plums, brrrr!
Bentos aren&#39;t just lunches in Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared particularly carefully - in the hope of being able to get to know the boy a little better during the break.
I read that in my manga.
I&#39;m curious to know if I could also observe it here.
&quot;Why Japan in particular?&quot; asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
So I always answered:
&quot;Because it fascinates me, what&quot;
In the end, reading manga has been my favorite thing for years already.
And in order to better understand manga and the culture therein, at some point I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, habits and customs.
And here, we give them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the land of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;
US House of Representatives rejects bailout
The first chamber of the US Congress narrowly thwarted the hefty $700 billion bailout of the financial markets.
The Dow Jones tumbled into the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the US House of Representatives rejected the government&#39;s financial markets bailout.
Despite all the calls from US President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that was supposed to curb the chaos in the financial markets did not win a majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the opponents of the merits of this heavy plan of 700 billion dollars.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called on the deputies to vote in favor despite the plan being unpopular.
&quot;It&#39;s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn&#39;t happened yet,&quot; he conceded.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones fell more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was investors&#39; concern that the state bailout might unravel.
It went up shortly before the end of the vote, only to then, after the announcement of the failure, fall again.
Experts are now projecting further severe turbulence in international financial markets.
For the program to enter into force, the approval of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are necessary.
Rats have feelings too
A rat or a cockroach runs away from danger, does that mean that it also feels fear?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how could we verify that he experiences the same thing when he behaves in the same way as us?
In the online magazine &quot;Edge&quot; contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles answers to the question &quot;What do you think is true without being able to have proof of it?&quot;
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness that I or anyone else have not yet been able to prove, just as you cannot prove that other human beings have a awareness.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and we approach the questions of feeling or in general of consciousness, we penetrate into difficult terrain because the Hardware does not correspond.
When a rat is faced with danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it plays dead, flees or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
However, I don&#39;t believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our subjective experience to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that the circuitry almost always associated with human consciousness includes the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its involvement in short-term memory and executive and executive functions).
This vast region is much more developed in human beings than in other primates and seems to be entirely absent in other beings.
At the very least, then, for those aspects of our consciousness which depend on the prefrontal cortex, among which the awareness of who we are, and the ability to foresee and decide, it is reasonable to suppose that the human being is even differentiated from other primates.
Another significant peculiarity could reside in the linguistic nature of Man: a large part of his existence being linked to language, this often means that his conscience depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not to depend on language, language would surely influence it, so that animal consciousness, however produced, would probably be very different from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is so difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, can neither be measured nor, because of this particular Hardware, analyzed based on our own experience, then its observation poses big problems for us.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
One could examine animal consciousness processes without considering their content, and that is exactly what has happened in studies of primate short-term memory, particularly with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one concentrates more on the neural correlates of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: the two may or may not be identical.
Curiously, this approach also underlines the weight of the prefrontal cortex in achieving visualization.
But what does this mean for the emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in a brain aware of its own activity.
What we designate as &quot;fear&quot; is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) monopolizes living memory.
Observed in this way, emotions are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and particularly humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our voluble nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impute them to others than ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that sensations from primitive activities arise in the regions of bodily sensation in the Cortex and the brainstem, as does Jaak Pankseep who, however, concentrates more on the brainstem.
As this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could very well take part in transversal sensations of all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it is undemonstrable.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in humans and in rats is also likely to be felt as such in both cases: how could one verify whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similar way?
A cockroach runs away from danger, but what if it feels fear?
In my eyes, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Certainly, the nervous comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brainstems, cockroaches on the other hand do not even have a brain.
But is the brainstem the source of sensations?
And even if we could prove this for humans: how could we demonstrate it in rats?
I believe rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have feelings.
But I don&#39;t know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are presumably completely different from ours (since human consciousness relies on special circuitry and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is poignant on the nervous level insofar as the same thing is gauged in rats and in humans.
As I don&#39;t explore language and consciousness in rats, nor sensations, I don&#39;t know if they exist.
You could judge this as short term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly bumping into a wall.
I am indeed an emotional pragmatist.
Platini, UEFA president: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
&quot;The government considers UEFA&#39;s decision in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine and in its ability to organise, in collaboration with Poland, the European championships&quot;, announced Wasjunik.
&quot;But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just started, and there is still a lot to do in both countries.&quot;
In the schedule of construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts are chasing after deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
&quot;We can&#39;t waste any more time.
We have to work at maximum speed,&quot; said Ukrainian League President Grigorij Surkis.
&quot;UEFA are constantly watching us.&quot;
An even more drastic measure has been decided in Poland.
The management of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The commission met at the request of Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is &quot;a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act within the rules,&quot; said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
&quot;We assured in a letter to the UEFA President that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer.&quot;
Several members of the First Division league were, already in the previous season, condemned for manipulation of compulsory relegation; in the end, the start of the League even had to be postponed at the last minute.
Organizers report growing number of bookings
It should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of reservations for the next few months, according to a study, the turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, Germans&#39; thirst for travel remains insatiable according to this study.
With regard to reservations for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 percent compared to the same period the previous year, as confided on Monday in Berlin by the German Federation Travel Agencies (DRV).
According to the survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, growing booking figures are already dominating the autumn months.
Thus the sales figure would have risen to approximately more 11 percent in comparison with 2007, confided the DRV.
The sources of these results are figures from the GfK, which analyzes monthly booking data from 1,200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel reservations made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded there.
Due to the low rate of the dollar, trips to the USA would be particularly in demand, said the DRV.
There the increase in reservations would amount to about a third.
Next to that, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our region would be destinations particularly sought after by Germans.
Package tours in particular are in high demand, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising energy and food prices, the costs here would be &quot;easier to calculate for the customer than for an individually organized trip&quot;.
Consumers can save money with, among other things, early booking discounts or All Inclusivie offers, explained Laepple.
The summer months were also very restrained so that an increase in sales figures will again be recorded compared to last year - although according to another study the number of Germans who have taken a trip has down compared to the previous year.
Dennis Quaid outraged strikes back
She wanted to promote a new film, opened up about her private life in an interview - and is now in trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has lifted the lid on her adulterous ex Dennis Quaid.
He foams - and counterattacks.
A belated War of the Roses for ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are engaged in an unsightly battle - in full view of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle on the causes of the breakdown of the marriage: &quot;Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful.&quot;
She reportedly learned of the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The motive for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan&#39;s press relations for his new film &quot;The Women&quot; - there is told the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid&#39;s reaction to his qualification as an unfaithful husband fell clearly: it would be &quot;Monstrous&quot;, said this one to the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, 54 years old, that &quot;Meg rehashed once again the history of our relationship and the manipulate&quot;.
It would be more &quot;regrettable&quot;, if &quot;the pain and upheaval that a divorce entails for each child were again rekindled in public&quot; for their common 16-year-old son Jack.
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
So was his response to the scratch: “Anyway, my life goes on.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family that is doing well.&quot;
Airfare and hotel prices fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced by up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would have become advantageous again - this is the result of a study by the financial and travel service provider American Express.
The company analyzed its bookings data for the first half of 2008 and found, after a rise in prices in the first quarter, a sharp drop in profits in the second quarter.
After prices in the hotel market have been rising for years, hotel nights have already reduced in many places.
From January to March prices increased in 41 of the 48 surveyed European cities by another 6.9 percent on average compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 surveyed European cities.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear especially in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would lie for American Express in the weak exchange rate of the dollar which led to a &quot;declining desire for travel by American tourists&quot;.
Financial centers such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices stand with a rise of 26.3 percent, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was upward in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in the price of kerosene, economy class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights even increased to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, economy class ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in business class and first class, the price variations were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
German domestic flights have even been halved according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would be on the one hand a sagging economic growth, explains the firm.
Demand would decline in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased pressure from competition due to the &quot;Open Skies&quot; treaty which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the cancellation by the airlines of non-profitable routes, as well as the high number of airlines which would have filed for bankruptcy during the first half of 2008 - there were 24 companies in Europe alone.
HSV beat Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, SV Hamburg become first in the standings.
In Borussia, Luhukay still hasn&#39;t managed to find a functional eleven.
By Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Crash landing for international player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player did not return until late in the game and his high shot failed against the frame of the goal.
His message was precisely worded, it came out of his lips persuasively.
He just knew he was right.
&quot;We need that second goal,&quot; hissed Hermann Rieger in the dressing room corridor of the Hamburg Arena.
There wasn&#39;t much going on in the locker room, halftime was over and most of them were back in their seats.
Rieger was HSV&#39;s physiotherapist for almost three decades and enjoys a high reputation like many former protagonists.
And that is why his request was received at strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and gave a thumbs up.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and let it go with that second goal!
The implementation failed.
&quot;It wasn&#39;t all very nice to see today,&quot; Marcel Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhard would have &quot;also wished to be more relaxed&quot;.
This 1:0 (1:0 at halftime) was due to a header from Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
&quot;It was a dirty victory,&quot; summed up Marin Jol.
SV Hamburg will celebrate their 121st birthday on Monday.
Already on Saturday afternoon, the supporters were celebrating themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking tables on the giant screen which indicated their club as first in class.
It&#39;s going to be a birthday without a real party.
&quot;We know how to take a step back&quot;, said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictability of the Premier League than the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late arrivals – the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen debauched from FC Bayern – is certainly forming slowly, but it is not yet shining.
&quot;We need more charm and more dribbling,&quot; demanded Jol.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Ballermann hits or Apres-Ski non-stop, beer in liter jugs and celebrities in designer Tyrolean costumes.
An event at the Oktoberfest.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don&#39;t actually have much in common.
She is blonde, TV host and wears a tailor-made Tyrolean costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes to the Oktoberfest, and already photographers are rushing at us and filling up their memory cards - very flattering, and that on my first visit to the Oktoberfest.
That&#39;s how you make friends.
The inexpensive Tyrolean costume seems to serve its purpose.
As an Oktoberfest tourist and normally living north of the Weißwurst equator, my sense of well-being in traditional costume has so far been limited.
But once in Place Thérèse, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears a Tyrolean costume or leather pants; no one looks jaded or ashamed - that&#39;s completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean costume reaps a few odd eyeballs at the banana-chocó stand.
A Bavarian woman pointed out to me that I had tied my apron badly: &quot;on the left means free, in the middle virgin, on the right broken, at the back widowed.&quot;
Discreetly, I fiddle with my loop from the back to the left.
&quot;That&#39;s better,&quot; she tells me and laughs.
Others don&#39;t go to as much trouble for these subtle flirting techniques and wear plain felt pens, which read &quot;Too drunk to get dressed!&quot; and exposes their bare rear end to us uninvited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, arrives from England and comes for the first time to the Oktoberfest.
He finds it &quot;gorgeous&quot;, with an elongated &quot;ooooo&quot;.
He tells me all this after having relieved himself of the mug he had drunk before.
Right next to that fire hydrant that everyone thinks is a trash can.
Bob is therefore one of those infamous &quot;wild pissers&quot;.
Others are not lucky enough to be able to get rid of alcohol this way.
Around eight o&#39;clock in the evening, swarms of rescuers run on the place of the festival and must take care of the poor drinkers.
The medics intervene rather in packs - always by four, they drag their stretcher covered with tents in tents.
This is how it works for most Oktoberfest visitors: you go empty, you come back full.
Those who rest in the coffin of the drunk under the tarpaulin are not visible.
&quot;These are the ones who can no longer swallow anything,&quot; one of the first aiders shouts at me in response to my question, then disappears into the fray.
After the failed vote
On Wall Street, fear circulates.
The first news of the failure of the bailout caused the Dow Jones to temporarily drop 700 points.
It was the biggest one-day point loss in history.
Later, the Dow Jones caught up a bit.
Around 8:30 p.m., the most important stock market index in the world was trading at 10,579 points with a drop of well over five percent.
The Nasdaq technology stock index was at 1548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The biggest losers in the Dow Jones at that date were American Express which lost almost 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
No stock could earn more profits.
Bank Goldman Sachs shares fell almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, top investor Warren Buffet joined the company.
Within the framework of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilized for the purchase of what are called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the sum should not be paid all at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company which can be exchanged correlatively to the evolution of the price in order to reduce the burden for the Public Treasury.
Stock prices sucked into the whirlwind in Europe and the United States
The billions in aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not alleviate the concerns of investors.
The share price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The American Dow Jones index collapses despite the bailout of the financial market planned by the State.
Dramatic declines in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank drove the German index (Dax) into a deep deficit.
The Bavarian real estate financier&#39;s share lost at times three-quarters of its value despite the bailout by the federal government and private banks, Commerzbank fell by more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped significantly below the important psychological bar of 6,000 points and traded at 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
Around the world, equity markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government&#39;s hefty $700 billion bailout might not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 lost in the first hour of opening 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The U.S. House of Representatives had intended to vote on the bailout, with the Senate vote expected to follow on Oct. 1.
The other European stock exchanges also showed only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index has so far fallen by 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris has lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan&#39;s main Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after initially rising 1.26 percent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index slipped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 points.
In the MDAX, shares of Arcandor fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourist multinational has also indicated that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has puzzled researchers: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe &quot;Ulysses&quot; has been flying in space.
Due to soon-frozen fuel conductions, cryogenic death threatens her.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been the cause of bewilderment among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a maneuver of space probes, by which they obtain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, the Earth for example.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick, as did the Ulysses solar probe.
This is what has amazed researchers elsewhere for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent as expected according to the venerable laws of gravity.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the level of the speed.
Probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They called it the gravitational support anomaly.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein&#39;s theory of general relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was right and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called the dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
&quot;Dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, matter which is also found near the Earth,&quot; he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is to say that it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, dark matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their captors, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released as the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shootout preceding the liberation, six hostage takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
Negotiations for the ransom would already be engaged.
The Germans are constantly in the crosshairs of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This was communicated jointly by Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after reports from the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: &quot;Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are checking their state of health”, said Frattini.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are doing well and are safe, announced Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants of the desert excursion should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the release of the hostages are still unclear: thus, the kidnappers would have been ready to put an end to the abduction, according to the statements of an Egyptian security agent, before the Sudanese army kills six of the kidnappers without warning.
&quot;The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom,&quot; the agent said.
All that remained was to collect the hostages&quot;, when suddenly, &quot;this surprise&quot; occurred.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday killed six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The hostage takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily &quot;El Masri El Jom&quot; stated that, according to the statements of a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men were to be restrained until the kidnappers found a safe route to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on this account.
Crash victim identified by police
A 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the crash on Friday afternoon in town on Shenfield Road.
She was taken to Queen&#39;s Hospital, Romford, but later died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Abuse of a stepfather &quot;which led to suicide&quot;
A court has been told that years of abuse by her stepfather led to a woman committing suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after admitting eight counts of indecent assault.
The Truro High Court referred that he regularly bound his stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, during her childhood, aged 5 to 7.
Trerise wrote in a confession letter, &quot;I feel responsible for his death.&quot;
The court heard that Miss Randle, 34, took her own life at her home in Mutley, Plymouth on April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had tied and bandaged her before forcing her into sexual acts, while her mother worked at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 80s, and he moved back to Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was told that Miss Randle, a hardworking National Trust volunteer, was haunted by the abuse she had been subjected to twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had said Ms Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had seemed &quot;emotionally dead&quot; since 2006, and &quot;had lost all hope in life.&quot;
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his flat in Plymouth.
It is believed that she committed suicide by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter&#39;s father-in-law, who had also written a letter of confession which ended as follows: &quot;I tied her up and bandaged her regularly&quot;.
&quot;I did not sexually abuse her.
&quot;I feel responsible for his death.&quot;
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: &quot;You&#39;re really weird as a fetishist, your victim must have been terrified, especially at the age of 7.
&quot;This unpleasant saga ended with the suicide of the victim.
And what is even more astonishing is the fact that if she had not committed this gesture, her story would certainly never have ended in court.
He added: &quot;I emphasize in particular, as described by her father and mother, the effects of your crime committed over the years on Stephanie.
&quot;Without these, she would undoubtedly be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today.&quot;
Conviction for loss of official data.
The ministerial officer of the Office Cabinet who had forgotten top secret documents, in June on a train, will be condemned by the Official Secrets Act, knew the BBC.
The Ministry of Defense man was on the road when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents passed through the hands of the BBC before being delivered to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said this episode had a lot of people in Whitehall.
&quot;They would have thought this matter would have stayed within the walls of the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet Office,&quot; he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is accused of violating section 8.1 of the act, that is to say the clause which deals with the safeguarding of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service has suggested that the law enforcement officer be placed under the custody of the Metropolitan Police, given the highly sensitive nature of his work with the Secret Service Associated Committee
The documents he lost contained assessments of Al-Qaeda as well as the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to an undisclosed location.
Building companies faced with the B&amp;B bill.
UK construction companies could face a bill of more than £80m to cover the bailout of Bradford &amp; Bingley bank.
The Government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford &amp; Bingleys&#39; 2.6 million savers.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all the companies collecting the savers&#39; money, including 59 construction companies.
Building Societies Association (BSA) chief executive Adrian Coles said it is &quot;irritating&quot; that societies and their members will have to pay the piper…
The £14bn loan will be repaid when Bradford &amp; Bingleys mortgages are cleared.
But the interests which will at the same time increase, will be debited, each year, to the 700 financial companies which collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that all 59 construction companies are included in this list.
It&#39;s irritating to see that the institutions that behaved cautiously…now have to pay some of the bills of the institutions that were far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each society must pay a sum proportional to the deposits it holds, and that the intermediary societies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount in 2009 to £450million.
This means companies will need to find £81m to pay interest for the first year.
Adrian Coles, chief executive of the Building Societies Trade Committee, told the BBC he felt the decision was unfair.
It is &quot;irritating&quot; to see that the institutions which behaved cautiously during the recovery of the housing market, must now pay for the much less cautious institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first annals.
&quot;We need to examine all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to assess the options to adopt to avoid that construction societies and their members pay this hefty bill,&quot; said Mr. Cole.
The interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, it will be necessary to pay the interest for the whole year, which could moreover double.
Since building societies are non-shareholder organizations, their member ends up footing the bill either through higher charges, or through lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought about joining the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate its hinterland.
On the east side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 paces from Asia, lies one of the finest relics of his fallen imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that&#39;s what the guides tell us.
The monument straddles the back of the platforms, equipped with an observation tower at each of its corners, like some German provincial town halls.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we are in no doubt as to the grandeur of the enterprise, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a latecomer to imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination through this railroad that reaches Damascus, Baghdad and the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions crumbled during World War I.
Its railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is over.
. The British and imperial forces advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, engulfed in the twists and turns of history.
But today, the railway passage to Anatolia and all the eastern points, serves - at least symbolically, to underline the widening of the diplomatic horizons of Turkey.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the icy borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a sleeper car heading to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish AKP MP Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a trip of 10 hours and a half, shaking on noisy rails whose pace recalled the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived, in the Turkish capital - presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning its back on its German past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents an example of the change in the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and particularly Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, purposely built of stone and steel, in a developing district, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and numerous patisseries in which middle managers in suits and ties - men and women - meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Suit, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
“The goal of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey now into its immediate neighborhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,&quot; he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Now she must look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case with one and the other.
She had to do both.
&quot;but, at some point, I asked if &#39;shouldn&#39;t Turkey choose?&#39;
&quot;Turkey&quot; he said &quot;does not want to have to choose between the two.&quot;
He then underlined an aspect that almost everyone I spoke to recited to me by heart: The Turkish railway does not only go to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea. , it is therefore as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe metaphorically traveling on rails towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another sleepless night, I thought back to those two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that European ambitions in the Middle East could, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
As I waited at the terminal for the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I was reminded of the period when Turkey had been called &quot;the sick of Europe&quot;.
At least there is no longer any doubt on the continent who could claim this fascinating country.
Milk rises to fivepence a liter
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy has announced it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by five pence a liter from Monday.
This is the second price increase following a twopenny increase in February, and comes on the back of research by a consulting firm.
Retailers must decide whether they will in turn raise the price to consumers.
. Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk was last varied in 2002.
An ex-PM from Bangladesh was denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request for former PM Sheikh Hasina, who risks being arrested upon returning to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail because of her indictment for extorting 50 million Taka ($729,000.00) from a businessman when she was PM.
This case is one of many accusations against him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina&#39;s lifelong rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh within weeks, but his party, the Awani League, has demanded that the country&#39;s interim military government first give him full freedom.
Correspondents have pointed out that the terms of her release are contradictory because if she is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they see no reason why she could not remain free upon her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court&#39;s order.
&quot;The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina&#39;s request saying she does not require bail as she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons,&quot; her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
“We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court”
Her lawyers argued that she needed the bond to return to the country to prepare for the elections in December
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, a former Awami party leader has said.
She was detained last year after the military interim government assumed power, but was released in June for treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina like Zhaleda Zia, deny the accusations against them.
Concerns for the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children missed the recent polio immunization drive due to Taliban-linked violence, the UN said.
The UN carried out a vaccination campaign in the six provinces last week.
But she says she has been unable to contact children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located to the south.
A UN spokesman said this happened despite Taliban promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of medics during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses ITV court battle
BSkyB lost its case following the Competition Commission&#39;s verdict, which would force it to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The commission said that in the past MSkyB&#39;s involvement had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement in effect to prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that BSkyB&#39;s purchase of ITV&#39;s shares cast doubt on ITV&#39;s effective independence, prompting the Competition Commission to investigate.
Virgin boss Richard Branson, a consumer group and regulator Ofcom were all opposed to the purchase.
BSkyB countered that forcing it to reduce its shares in ITV would not be reasonable and on the contrary was excessive – especially since BSkyB has just given up its voting rights.
New investigation in the case of the American prosecutors.
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to verify the issue of the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
It all grew out of the Justice Department Inspector General&#39;s case report, which was critical of the actions of certain law enforcement officials.
The report was critical of White House officers, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of the lawyers who maintain that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officers questioned during the investigation lied to investigators, thereby obstructing justice.
“Serious, unfounded, potentially criminal conduct charges have not been fully confirmed or resolved,” Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor capable of compelling witnesses to testify was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute begins with the disbarment in December 2006 of nine American prosecutors formulated by the American Department of Justice.
At the time, the department said prosecutors were fired for poor performance.
But then it emerged that the fired prosecutors were no more criticized than their other colleagues, prompting some observers to attribute a political connotation to these dismissals.
Some of the prosecutors have been accused of being close to congressional Republicans, while others have reportedly refused to investigate accusations of fraudulent voting against Democrats.
US prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting legal proceedings for the government.
It is certain that they can be fired at any time, but cannot be for political reasons.
The head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up being accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and in the end, he resigned.
A number of judicial officers from the Department of Justice have also resigned.
The Inspector General&#39;s report was highly critical of Mr. Gonzales&#39; role in the matter, stating that he held him &#39;primarily responsible&#39; for these dismissals, and eventually &#39;abdicating&#39; his leadership role, remarkably succeeding in not involved in this matter.
Other law enforcement officials, including former Bush aide Karl Rove, have been criticized for failing to cooperate with the investigation.
Meat Loaf&#39;s epic should be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic singing Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was &quot;honoured&quot; to gain the recognition.
The nine-minute-and-fifty-second song was the title track to Meat Loaf&#39;s 1977 album hit.
The awards night is presented by Coldplay, with this year&#39;s selection limited to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor of Q magazine, said: &quot;There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like Meat Loaf&#39;s.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979, charting at number fifteen.
Additionally, his album Bat Out of Hell stayed in the UK charts for nine years, and sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - or Marvin Lee Aday as he is - has suffered from health issues in recent years, even undergoing surgery to cure his irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage in 2003.
In 2007, severe laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then they found a cyst in her vocal cords.
A Dark Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and May Soon Be on Sale.
New York has hundreds of parallel avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, some purely functional.
. And even some veteran taxis as well as long-time local residents don&#39;t know how to give directions to Extra Place, because they&#39;ve never heard of it.
The street is in the East Village and runs north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide by 120 long, it looks like a dusty alley rather than a busy thoroughfare.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repave Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to the shops and boutiques, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including longtime neighbors, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets on the block.
But the city&#39;s Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development, which manages the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighborhood homeowners&#39; committees, representatives from City Agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal allowing the builder to purchase the street.
But the committee prefers the street remain in city hands, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No. 3.
“There are only a few city-owned spaces left, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place,” she said.
&quot;They might offer to rehabilitate and manage it, which Avalon might do, but we want to keep it public.&quot;
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to repave the small street and install seats there, some of which would also be used by a café to which the builder will concede the space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month&#39;s meeting.
Avalon Bay spokesperson Michele de Milly said that while the company wants to operate the street, that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it wants to own it.
&quot;Avalon Bay&#39;s main interest is to revamp this abandoned alley, and make it public,&quot; she said, stressing that it was the city that suggested the sale to her.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for Property Preservation, confirmed that the city was keen to sell the street, further emphasizing that the agency&#39;s mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has had this name since 1802, when the inheritance of the large farm from the many children of Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since remained abandoned.
The back entrance of CBGB, a punk rock landmark closed in 2006, has reopened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of Ramones&#39; album &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot;
&quot;This place was beautiful,&quot; said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of scrap metal, rags, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.&quot;
Some residents, including bloggers who had previously spoken about the East Village&#39;s evolution towards luxury, objected to the idea of selling Extra Place, saying the humble little property should remain public.
Others proclaimed Extra Place a real rarity - a virtually identical fragment of the city that should be laid to rest.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah&#39;s Vanishing New York (subtitled &quot;The Book of Protests: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Extinction&quot;) relates the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
Author, Brendan Gill, wrote: &quot;Extra Place is a narrow little cul-de-sac, dark by day and night, and bounded by rusting iron warehouse doors and shutters, full of newspapers from the past week which fly away along the gutters.&quot;
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A rat runs nimbly down the alley, near a door that once led to CBGB, now home to a fancy clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22-ounce beer bottle, lies next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
A few passers-by said that they rarely think of Extra Place, and suggested that it be showcased.
Mr Field, meanwhile, said he thought some underestimated the appeal of the street in its current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “were spent in dark, damp, filthy places.”
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English language
In this part of the Education Oversight program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidate&#39;s position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former member of California Studies, and former director of the education department at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book &quot;Not as Good as You Thought. Why the Middle Classes Must be able to choose their school.”
Currying favor with Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama&#39;s proposals on education are an interesting example.
Mr. Obama&#39;s campaign points out that &quot;African American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students.&quot; it is a true fact.
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama&#39;s education program specifically supports, among many other topics, &quot;bilingual transitional education&quot; for those who learn English.
The question for Obama, however, is whether his desire to achieve a bilingual education that champions classroom instruction in languages other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in East Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are mostly Hispanic, and of low income.
More than a third of the students, made up of many new arrivals, study English.
Among the CM1 students, 100% passed the 2008 state maths exam, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students passed the English-Language-Arts exam
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient than that advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street relies on analysis, practice, constant evaluation of abilities and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and this is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, principal of Sixth Street, this school has introduced “full immersion” English language instruction.
Total English language immersion focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Miss Mikels, against bilingual education, told me &quot;we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you would have had no chance to identify it.&quot;
“It works, she observes, “it worked for us”
Shouldn&#39;t Mr. Obama take the example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools made up of a majority of Hispanic students learning English?
The excellent results obtained by this school speak for themselves; but education policies within his party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and his overwhelming support for bilingual education, cloud the prognosis of Ms. Obama.
Although he is in favor of immigrants learning English, Mr. Obama recently dismissed this issue as trivial, when he proclaimed that we all need to stop arguing about the wording of English-language laws.
On the contrary, he stated, &quot;you need to make sure your child speaks Spanish.&quot;
If Mr. Obama is serious about eliminating differences, then he should consider carefully the education models that work, rather than dismissing them or dismissing them as insignificant.
Sharp Oil Drop Following New Worries in the World of Economics
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday as people feared the bailout for financial markets might not succeed in reviving the economy.
Crude oil futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel. The New York Mercantile Exchange, during this morning&#39;s sales.
Prices have fallen more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by financial turmoil on Wall Street, as well as two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After rising to $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, before rebounding again in the face of deep uncertainties in financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again worried despite the agreement on the rescue plan, the largest in history, concluded this weekend by the leaders of Congress.
The news was dampened by recent concerns that the crisis is long-lasting.
In the latest installment of this financial catastrophe,&quot; Citygroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said frantic negotiations over the weekend, concluded with the bailout deal &quot;appear to have failed to revive the market&quot;.
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to slow.
&quot;The outlook for global equity, interest rate and trading markets has become uncertain,&quot; Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors.
&quot;We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
“As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus would spread globally and in particular, in China”.
Bank analysts lowered their expectations for next year as oil consumption plummeted due to slowing economic growth, so were forced to cut 20 percent oil and gas price forecasts for 2009 .
The Decisive Second Time Party for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After spending more time in the Jets&#39; Shaun Ellis uniform than anyone in the past eight seasons, the defenseman thought he&#39;d seen it all.
He was watching the second half, when the Jets turned a 0-0 into an explosion.
&quot;I&#39;ve never seen anything like it,&quot; Ellis said.
The second half started after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals played badly under dark clouds.
Then quarterback Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown from 12 yards, a harbinger of an afternoon during which their relationship took a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a cornerback fell and the second, 10 seconds from halftime.
&quot;I didn&#39;t get out of my zone&quot; Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
&quot;He&#39;s a mediocre player&quot;
&quot;We communicated extremely well, despite what people think.&quot;
As Favre and Coles played catch, the defense beat Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, cornerback, intercepted a stray shot and went 32 yards to touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball slip away because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of the ball from Bowens, could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of that possession for the final 10 seconds, and then the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely making a 20-yard goal for a 34-0 lead.
It was the best the Jets could score in one beat.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, asked to describe the madness, said &#39;second time or third?&#39;
When told of both - the Jets blew an undisputed 21 points in the third time - Mangini said: &quot;I can tell you that I enjoyed the second time more than the third.
&quot;A lot of points were scored in a short time.&quot;
Gebrselassie rested, exceeds his world record.
Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie has again proven himself worthy of his title as the best long-distance runner of the century, after breaking his own world record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in under 2 hours. and 4 minutes.
With a victory in 2:03:59 of an accommodating race on the flat, Gebrselassie beat his record of 2:04:26, disputed last year in Berlin, by 27 seconds.
At 35, Gebrselassie has won the 26th world record of his superb career in which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, from the 1600m to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps exaggerated in today&#39;s eyes - that air pollution would increase his asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run to Berlin.
In near-perfect conditions - sunny weather, 48 degrees start, 55 degrees finish - Gebrselassie won on Sunday, maintaining an impressive average of a mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyan-turned-distance runners, have helped the marathon record drop by more than two minutes in the past decade since 1998, when Brazil&#39;s Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05.
After Sunday&#39;s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he suffered from calf cramps two weeks before and missed training for a week.
It is obvious that rest has kept it shiny, but not rusty.
&quot;I&#39;m so happy,&quot; he told reporters.
&quot; Everything was perfect.
I got back into it last week, and today I had my doubts; but in the end, everything turned out for the best.&quot;
He has been criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia&#39;s East African rival - for having orchestrated his races too much, avoiding world stars in the marathon, in fact relying on the hares as if they were in a track competition. , and considering world records more than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie&#39;s abilities as a distance runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. half-way.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the frontrunners disappeared.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final comeback to pull away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, bettering his personal best by five minutes.
Kamathis came third in 2:07:48.
In the women&#39;s race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year posting the seventh time of 2:19:19.
Paula Radcliffe of England holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone by winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She couldn&#39;t participate in the Beijing Games because of a hypothetical back problem, but promised to win in Berlin, bettering in her third marathon, her personal best of almost five minutes.
She ran using clever strategy, letting the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners take a clear lead, then overtaking them about 18½ miles later.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya was third in 2:25:01.
In a City Apart, Pride and the Trials of Black Life
Hidden away in its sprawling park development, a few miles from sunny, shiny, giant Orlando, lies a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
&quot;Eatonville, the first all-black city to integrate, the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, this description she made in 1935, is not so easy to do today.&quot; The city of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skinned people, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guavas, two schools and no jails.&quot;
It has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival, held each year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in many ways, the town she describes—became touristy thanks to its inclusion in The Depression-era Federal Writers&#39; Project&#39;s Florida Travel Guide—remains a place of its own.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was in the 1930s, when Hurston said that rural black Florida people were often reluctant to share their true thoughts with the white man, who &quot;knowing us so little, does not know what he loses&quot;.
Even though this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also invoked an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious about the gaze of the &#39;foreign.
&quot;We&#39;re very careful about how to tell the story,&quot; said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and the town&#39;s oldest parishioner.
&quot;It has to be realistic.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It represents both a historical model of black empowerment as well as a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a focal point but also an example of black Southern rural culture – sometimes scorned, other times acclaimed – that recalls the birth of American slavery.
Which would explain why the residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in Eatonville&#39;s image started with Zora, whom everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heartfelt, dialect-filled books such as &quot;Mules and Men&quot; (1935) and &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guidebook transformed this city, located just off Route 17, a route through often-forgotten central Florida that culminates in a chapter of black history and human drama.
Bold as a bass drum in life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store owned by Eatonville&#39;s first mayor, Mr. Joe Clarke, which was later divided into several private parts.
&quot;past the road on the left&quot;, she writes, &quot;you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its well-preserved gardens and play areas which Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he can barely read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash&#39;s new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn &quot;sells all kinds of drinks and anything that can be used by people passing through.
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor was not like that.
It wasn&#39;t actually a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora described reality well,&quot; said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson&#39;s young daughters whom Hurston immortalized, citing the colorless songs sung by men who praised their beauty.
She added, &quot;some people didn&#39;t like it.&quot;
Hurston is always remembered as a lively and eccentric person, who returned frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually drove into town unannounced in a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing slacks here, where even today we are proud of traditional dress.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin recounted, while many laughed at her.
&quot;People were always happy to see Zora,&quot; he said.
But he further adds, rocking in his chair on the back patio overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was likely baptized, that “she never stayed too long.”
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in some grave in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no major commemoration or plaque for the general public.
I don&#39;t think they understood the contribution or the legacy she offered to the world,&quot; said Valerie Boyd, author of &quot;Wrapped in Rainbows,&quot; a 2003 biography of Hurston.
A crucial moment came in the 1980s.
Orange County public officials wanted to run a five-lane freeway through town, replacing Kennedy Boulevard, the community&#39;s main two-lane street.
Orlando&#39;s development has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal came as Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, ended the community&#39;s relatively idyllic isolation.
In the 1950s, the race-mixing dispute brought hatred to the doorsteps of the community.
&quot;At that time, a bunch of young white people would come and throw oranges or objects at people sitting on the side,&quot; Franklin said.
“one lady even died.”
They threw a watermelon out of their car.&quot;
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston cast doubt on the Supreme Court&#39;s motion for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education &quot;insulting rather than glorifying my race&quot;.
Residents now claim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, while positive in some aspects, has diluted Eatonville&#39;s cohesion and weakened the confidence of young people.
&quot;Black children used to be kissed - I remember well - we kissed our master in the morning, and in the evening too&quot; declared NY Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins as well as chief director of Safeguarding of the Community of Eatonville, a non-profit group.
This lasted, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
“You don&#39;t kiss your white teacher because he&#39;s white – I mean there&#39;s a cultural dividing line here,” Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, by the way, has created space for many more Zora Neale Hurston—black writers, actors, and artists who have gone beyond prejudice, such as her, armed with a joyous confidence of her own. and guidelines such as: &quot;how can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!&quot;
That beats me.&quot;
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited Hurston&#39;s unmarked grave and began to struggle to revive his reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a true bestseller, thus reintroduced her to the American canons.
The freeway project came just as Eatonville&#39;s most famous girl had regained her allure.
And this time, Hurston&#39;s old neighbors see her as a savior.
The community began to organize a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences that this highway would cause.
Hundreds of fans came to the festival&#39;s inauguration two years later, and many return in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county rejected the highway proposal.
&quot;The fiasco of the five-lane highway, extremely fast, a real civic pride,&quot; said Melle. Natiri.
Miss Boyd summed it all up stating that &quot;Zora saved Eatonville&quot;.
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, like Rachelle Munson, an attorney who has attended our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been listed as a historic town since 1998.
A mono-themed library (renamed of course Hurston) opened in 2006, on a magnificent, repaved Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a back street on a rainy summer day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(nowadays 90 percent are black)
Outsiders who come to learn about Eatonville&#39;s history, its raison d&#39;être, are still treated with caution.
You have to ask permission for most interviews, and some things - like the walls of the old church in Eatonville, painted by the white man, depicting black men in the fields - shouldn&#39;t be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Miss Jones, a spunky teacher and a fan of bright red, still fear their island community will be misunderstood.
However, with the expansion of the Hurston Festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular tend to view Eatonville as Hurston viewed his entire race: beautiful, problematic and all, neither better nor worse, but as proud, creative, hard-working, crazy and mixed as any other ethnic and racial group in America.
It is indeed genuine civic affection in the voice of Mr. Franklin&#39;s nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or the forces. of Police, who need additional forces.
And even for the younger ones, like 11-year-old Alondra and Alexia Kenon, twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
&quot;Most people passing through this area will think, &#39;oh, this town is nothing compared to others&#39;,&quot; Alondra Kenon said after mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate the history, it&#39;s a very beautiful city.&quot;
Here in New York, everyone is fluent in finance.
However, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newsstand and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn&#39;t realize they were in the eye of the storm.
Never would they think that in the glass and honeycomb offices above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York City, are having the worst &quot;working day in the office&quot; since crack. of 1929.
Delivery people continue to thread the sidewalks, with their carts and trays of muffins for morning meetings.
The Latinos still hang around between the residential buildings wearing, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging from a yoke placed on his shoulders.
Office workers continue to line up to buy their morning sandwich from street vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
I hadn&#39;t felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic accounts until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work in the late afternoon, because I discovered at my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, about twenty people queuing.
Not in front of the cashier counters, nor to withdraw cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service counter, where regular customers ordered their checkbooks, tourists asked for directions to the Macy&#39;s store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my &quot;licensed personal banker&quot;, were all queuing for the same reason I was.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They took their money out of savings accounts called thrifts (like a building society), credit associations, and the type of local thrifts and their branches that only operate in one state, and claim to process customers like their family.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with a capital of $ 327 has appealed to the bankruptcy trustee, and as New Yorkers returned home for the weekend this Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, to the savings accounts of worth $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and store employees in front of me, scared of another potential meltdown, have transferred their money to a bank they believe to be reliable, the one that does the most bailouts on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
&quot;I could hear a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone about Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and its skinny chief executive Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she might have had when criticizing a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed janitor in my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or deliveries from my greengrocer.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. &quot;I put all my savings into the money market.
&quot;I have changed, I don&#39;t want to take any risks&quot;.
Memoirs of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Musical Director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon &quot;Tod&quot; Handley (d. 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was to include those under 21, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 refused to give up the choir.
The name &quot;Proteus&quot; (which changed form according to mythology) represented the choir&#39;s willingness and ability to handle any type of music presented to it, whether madrigal or messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to one man&#39;s inspiration and enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how much Tod kept telling us to &quot;let the music speak for itself&quot;.
He would have said: &quot;The composer knows what he wants&quot;
It&#39;s all there, in the music.
So sing!&quot;
His wand technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should be knighted, it&#39;s Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I&#39;ve seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me - and sometimes even inspired me.
Tod Handley held this rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who he said &quot;only focus on certain people.&quot;
He will be missed by many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (who died on September 25) states that &quot;in 1946, he had resumed his studies in economic history at Oxford, and in 1950 became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while he was doing a BSc, an MA and a PhD&quot;.
This is from the author&#39;s letter to Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but it is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and was at the same time completing a PhD thesis on the British plastics industry, under the supervision of Professor JD Chambers; it was then published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
In the 50s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
Why Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria swings to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization of &quot;cities against Islamization&quot; in Antwerp on Thursday January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs depicting red-striped mosques.
Police accuse far-right extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the weekend of the victory of far-right political parties in the country&#39;s general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning; according to the police, it is an organized action.
Offenders painted several graves with Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; however, detectives believe this may have been done to disguise extremists&#39; feelings of hatred towards Muslim immigrants.
Could this accident be somehow related to the elections.
A spokesperson for the local Islamic Community said it was &quot;deeply shocked&quot; at the news of the desecration, which comes just as the religious month of Ramadan is coming to an end.
Austria is seriously thinking about regaining its courage, following its swing to the right in yesterday&#39;s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that won almost 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, waged an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party which won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against the wearing of headscarves and burkas, and even voiced his opposition to alaha food.
During his final run in Vienna, he spoke of &quot;a European brotherhood&quot; to avert the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, claiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyzes carried out just after the elections, defined the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because worried about their future in the &#39;European Union.
Gary Glitter banned from overseas travel.
Courts have banned glamorous rock star, Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed on Glitter a banishment of six months, after he expressed to the authorities who have him under control, his intention to go to Spain via France.
Police in Kent issued the travel ban last Thursday after proving Glitter guilty of child molestation.
Glitter, or his real name Paul Gadd, was not present during the hearing at the Ashford Courts of Limited Jurisdiction, but was represented by his solicitor Corker Binning anyway.
A court spokesman said “On Thursday September 25th at Ashford Court, Kent Police applied for an application to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain until March 25th.
&quot;Paul Gadd was not present then&quot;.
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, even if it meant being registered on the list of accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police 7 days before his planned departure date.
If he does not report his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years in prison.
Kent Police said they would not discuss individual cases or Glitter&#39;s potential movements within the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said, &quot;Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect our children and those overseas.
&quot;We believe it&#39;s easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because we have systems that can deal with any potential risks much more effectively.
&quot;Protecting the people of Kent is the highest intention of Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behavior of those accused of sexual abuse in the area, in order to minimize potential risk to the public.&quot;
. Glitter returned to the UK last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, aged 10 and 11 respectively.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok from where he should have boarded a flight to London.
But he said he did not feel well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities stopped him at passport control, and in the end he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, and was therefore obliged to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on August 22 and remained there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Court of Limited Jurisdiction in Uxbridge, West London, to register him on the list. people accused of sexual abuse, as demanded by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already served a four-month sentence in the UK for possessing child abuse images.
A Home Office source said Home Secretary Jacqui Smith was reassured and happy to know that Glitter had been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
&quot;I photograph the master offstage to capture elements of his character&quot; Günther Bauer - Photographer
Neither heels nor New Year&#39;s clothing.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, released from all tensions to obtain the relaxed aspect of the man or the woman.
On one side the artist.
On the other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in those moments unknown to the general public, where we discover through intimate gestures and stolen glances artists who do not care to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer mixes in &quot;Flamenco - people&quot; the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of the artists.
In this project, the photographer takes up the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the program of the Month of Flemish Photography, the exhibition &quot;reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day&quot;, explains the creator, who clarifies that &quot;Flamenco - people&quot; &quot;can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the viewer realizes that these are not typical images of performers on stage.
These people photographed &quot;in the street&quot; are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy ... captivating the public.
To capture moments of personality of these artists you should not take pictures on stage.
They have their own personality and character.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera personal moments of flamenco stars&quot;.
With the festival &quot;Chant populaire des Mines&quot;, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and equipment, bring to mind classic photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: &quot;Music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day &quot;.
It is not the dancing or singing per se, but the personality and character of the performer that captivates the audience with their art.
The search for the essential and for magic has been the constant of this work that is presented these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Flamenco stars like Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from around seventy artists photographed.
The project turned into a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book of portraits exhibited at the gallery.
Bauer&#39;s passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the &quot;Portraits of Old Sportsmen&quot; (&quot;SportARTproject&quot;).
Although the concepts are different in &quot;Flamenco - people&quot;, the photographer admits that he loves to photograph the portrait of people, to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a more or less long moment.
I believe that in photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters that you sometimes don&#39;t know or who only give you a few minutes to be able to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.&quot;
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco which is entitled &quot;Flamenco - people&quot;, is exhibited at the Gallery El Fotómata, located at number 20 rue de la Mata (street parallel to the Peupleraie d&#39;Hercule) which will be open until October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he is writing is &quot;truly audacious&quot;
The novel takes place in places no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to push forward the new project he is working on, a novel that has Roger Casemant as its main character, an Irish nationalist who lived for twenty years in the Congo and who passed through the Amazon.
The favorite for the Nobel Prize for Literature confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia, that the novel which currently occupies him &quot;is a real audacity&quot; and that &quot;everything shows that he should not write it&quot;.
&quot;If I was reasonable, I wouldn&#39;t do it, but I will do it and I hope to finish it&quot;, he concluded in his intervention at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts which for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people parade through the city of the aqueduct.
The author of &quot;The City and the Dogs&quot; was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize by the majority of the votes of the participants, sold out the Juan Bravo theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, found himself face to face with a fascinated public who did not see the past hour during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a large dose of humour, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to &quot;his thirst for reading&quot; and &quot;to live new experiences&quot;; how he wrote in a &quot;very methodical way&quot; through intense documentation work, correcting and rewriting some of the text to deal with his &quot;lack of inspiration&quot;; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspire his novels.
The Hispanic-American novelist acknowledged that &quot;there is no way&quot; to measure and know if books change lives. &quot;But I refuse to believe that literature is pure fun, an ephemeral experience,&quot; said Vargas Llosa, who said that it &quot;has effects&quot; and &quot;makes people less similar&quot; because we asked writers &quot;not to indulge in frivolity&quot; and to assume their vocation.
Bad weather spoils the Pozoblanco Fair
The banderilla festival that concluded the bullfights of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning after bullfighters on horseback checked that the bullring was impassable.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernández, has decided to suspend the celebration of the bullfight.
Bad weather plagued this fair, as two parties out of three could not take place.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second scheduled bullfight.
On the bill, there were José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who should have faced each other in the Castilblanco arena
So only the Friday party took place
On Friday the winner was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and was carried in triumph, having made arm movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded with two banderillas planted on the back of the bull and a severed ear that the uncovered bleachers applauded more than his fight in itself with the bull.
Worse still for El Juli, who entered the Los Llanos bullring without pain or glory.
During his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whistled by most of the public.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hashish found
Ten to five in the morning.
Traffic control by the Euskadi police (the Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón (Alava).
The police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter two begin to flee.
His load, more than two tons of hashish, enough to stop them.
The police chased them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as AAJ, according to information disclosed by the Basque Government&#39;s Interior Department.
The arrested individual was charged with drug trafficking and falsification of documents.
The incident took place when different officials from the Alava Traffic Unit were carrying out vehicle checks on the N-1, at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly accelerated and the check started.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers further on the roadside, where the two occupants got out to flee in a wooded area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and which they found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with bales of hashish. Then they transferred him to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drugs.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate had been &quot;falsified&quot; since it did not coincide with that written on the gray card of the van, which is also why they charged the detainee with an offense falsification of documents.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the source of the drugs seized.
The detainee, 28-year-old AAJ, was taken into custody to carry out the various procedures and will be tried in the hours that follow.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving while impaired
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the television series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw her make strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to what a spokesperson for the California police patrol disclosed to People magazine.
The witness clarified that around 4:30 p.m., Locklear &quot;was pressing the accelerator hard, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and while going into reverse several times, it rolled over its sunglasses&quot; .
Shortly after, the witness, who at first did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and got out of her vehicle.
This person, at the time, called the emergency services because &quot;she was worried about Locklear&#39;s life&quot;.
When the police patrol arrived they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
&quot;She looked disoriented&quot;, which is why the agents took her to the specialized center for drugs and alcohol to carry out a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was ruled out from the start, although &quot;based on the observation of police officers at first glance, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of a drug&quot;.
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the clinic in Arizona where she was interned to treat a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares urged the Andalusian federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to take a decision on the case of the former councilor of Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of giving preferential treatment to members of his family.
“In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities,” Llamazares said of the behavior of the political party that he will have to adopt in the Seville City Council. .
However, the United Left leader called for the investigations to show &quot;transparency&quot; for irregularities that Silva may have committed: &quot;The United Left has always defended these kinds of cases so that they have the maximum degree of transparency. &quot;.
He also pointed out that the political party has &quot;very strict codes of ethics for all civil servants&quot;.
&quot;Sangre de Mayo&quot;, the daring bet of Garci
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spaniards against the French in &quot;Sangre de mayo&quot;, which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with a budget of almost 15 million euros. .
The filmmaker tried &quot;to portray the many characters and illustrate the social analysis&quot; that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría leading the long list of actors.
The more than two and a half hour long film, “Sangre de mayo” will be released in cinemas next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós&#39;s literature, José Luis Garci claims to have achieved with this shoot &quot;a childhood dream&quot; thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago to shoot a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May 2 in Madrid, something he always accepted when the story stuck to national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Municipality of Madrid constitute for Garci a &quot;unique opportunity&quot; to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of &quot;a Spain which has taken the wrong leader for the fight, since, the struggle for independence led the people to rebellions during the reign of Ferdinand VII,&quot; he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding as for the films &quot;Capitaine Alatriste&quot; or &quot;Goya&#39;s ghosts&quot; - more than double that obtained for &quot;Sangre de mayo&quot; -, because he was unable to shoot a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated for most of his career.
The filmmaker of &quot;Volver a empezar&quot; influenced on his usual way of working, on the staging of the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting filming and to whom he does not cast, since this seems &quot;humiliating&quot; to him and considers that &quot;the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater and the cinema to keep informed&quot;.
Many actors in &quot;Sangre de mayo&quot; rehearse in front of the camera, like Miguel Rellán, by Carlos Larrañaga or by Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
A four-time Oscar nominee (he won one), Garci considers the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, &quot;Sangre de mayo&quot;, &quot;Seven French billiard tables&quot; and ultimately the winner, “The Blind Sunflowers,” is not representative of young Spanish cinema, “which deserves to be better known,” he said.
With this film Garci does not expect a prize.
&quot;At first you think you&#39;re working for posterity, then you realize you&#39;re only working for prosperity, and now you&#39;re just making one more movie,&quot; Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón puts herself in the shoes of the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer will pay homage to a dancer who is also Sevillian.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and who at the age of three will go to live in London with her family. .
She was a free dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer of women&#39;s liberation, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset which prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe between the wars fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
&quot;I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter offered me to interpret the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me&quot;.
According to the dancer, &quot;we are not trying to tell her life story but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances made me think of flamenco.
Thus, &quot;the butterfly dance&quot; made me think of a popular Cuban dance and &quot;the snake dance&quot; of certain tangos.
Her dancing was sensual and they told me my way of dancing was the same as hers,” she claims.
The staging was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabela again in one of his shows, as he had done in &quot;La puerta abierta&quot;; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who was exceptionally willing to collaborate with the one who was his student.
&quot;Matilde transforms Tórtola into a mature character.
I am happy because she accepted to play a role in my work and that honors me&quot;.
The staging was also done thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, to the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; to the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, &quot;who plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were considered divas &quot;.
This work also recounts, in a certain way, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in such distant places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, but also in all Europe, since she usually resided in London.
&quot;I wanted to remember her because I think these are the women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows and values her work,&quot; says Bayón.
The show will start at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theater
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
&quot;I recommend José Vicente Resino&#39;s exhibition &quot;Flamenco and Life&quot; because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They caught my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they convey and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys many feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.&quot;
The publication of the &quot;Diary of a recently married poet&quot; concludes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the &quot;Diary of a Recently Married Poet&quot; in Saint Stephen&#39;s Church in New York, the place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the &quot;Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium&quot; (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the awarding of the Nobel Prize for Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the &quot;Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium&quot; comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the traveling exhibition &quot;Juan Ramón Jiménez: This poplar of light&quot; which was inaugurated last May and which, after having traveled to the different Andalusian provinces, will go to New York during the International Congress.
Likewise, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia purchased eight hundred copies of the &quot;Diary of a recently married poet&quot;, edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of a of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America is less pleasant without Paul Newman
&quot;Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was one of them.&quot;
This sentence is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in &quot;Absence of Malice&quot;, and illustrates well the despair of American cinema, and of all America, faced with the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He struggled to get an Oscar
He hadn&#39;t been filming since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a blow for everyone.
&quot;Sometimes what one feels passes all expression, and now I have lost a great friend&quot;, cried Robert Redford, &quot;my life and my country were better because of his existence&quot;.
No one was afraid of making a fool of themselves or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of cinema and of the homeland died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and the stock markets are frightening, the esteem of Americans has fallen very low, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When times are so hard and without a reason to live, all human beings are left with is admiration and you don&#39;t have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an enemy of Richard Nixon and a defender of lost and won causes, such as the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of his elder who died of an overdose and the creation of his own brand of organic food.
It was a victory for a country that has struggled to assert itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood regardless of nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar winner Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
“He set the bar high for us,” said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who tries to break through the screen like Paul Newman did: by being very honest and having a serious private life. and far from the goals.
It&#39;s still not easy or possible in today&#39;s media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even if he had no shortage of opportunities not to be.
“But why should I eat a burger outside my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?” he used to joke.
In heaven, he watches with pride as his daughters meet his fans on earth, something not so usual in America.
“Of all the great roles he has played, he has never been more proud than that of devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather and philanthropist,” they say.
Madrid in the race to host the 2016 Olympics
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, it could come true in 2016.
But I wonder if we are ready.
If we take the example of yesterday&#39;s race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but in my opinion it was the worst race I have ever participated in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, these would be the subject of an eliminatory score.
But let&#39;s consider everything in detail and from the very beginning.
Mistakes start with picking up bibs, which forces you to get there early.
It&#39;s not bad but if they make you move it would be better if they give you everything (including the electronic chip for shopping).
Well no
They made you go there only to pick up the bib (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only size &#39;S&#39; for the shirt ( second mistake, because I need size XL)
In what world are we living?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small size jerseys with less fabric and therefore cheaper?
Well, that&#39;s nothing compared to what happened on race day.
Apart from the fact that you have to go there very early to remove the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions started and we hadn&#39;t left our backpacks at the entrance yet, although once we did, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which there were rebellions and attacks on the barracks.
I believe around 500 people will get pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, won&#39;t even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me which I think didn&#39;t not marked the start correctly.
Of course, if they asked me to cite an example of a perfect race, this one would certainly not occur to me.
So I believe that we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympics.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the Emerging Technologies conference at MIT Microsoft was presented with a new system for image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in Microsoft&#39;s case, a shuttle to get around the company campus) in response to being asked in conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this &quot;receptionist&quot; can know how many people there are in the place, who they are - including remembering what positions they hold - and listen and hear the key words of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but she understands that she does not belong to the group that is speaking with her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks if she is here to visit someone and she tells him that she will answer him in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course this represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we also talked about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it won&#39;t have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with essentials instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding functions and &quot;extras&quot; to Windows.
The change in strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome hit the net, I was one of those who bought into the theory that Google Chrome is Google&#39;s first move to compete with Windows.
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary since it is the essential basis for the computer hardware and the software to understand each other.
He has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
It&#39;s true.
It will never disappear but the &quot;death&quot; of the operating system must be seen not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed that idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system and more and more to the Internet browser.
We turn on the computer only to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time surfing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who are half of the applications supplied with the system used for?
Who can do more can do less.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much fewer than Vista.
Less cumbersome, less cluttered, less complex.
For the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo in this article was taken earlier this month in one of Microsoft&#39;s employee break rooms in Redmond.
On the beverage dispenser, a poster asks them to use their own research tool - &quot;Your research. Our future&quot;.
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released at the beginning of 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will surely try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, is becoming more and more like a computer.
But with the launch of Android being late and the iPhone already in the market, it will cost them dearly.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick&#39;s &#39;Blood Diamond&#39;, as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s &#39;The Godfather&#39; and is part of the outfit of the Association of Muscular Gays.
And if we start listing all his appearances, we could also mention this burly mustachioed who lifted weights in a traveling circus.
It&#39;s not just a cotton, form-fitting, sleeveless men&#39;s undershirt.
The English call it &#39;tank&#39; but the Fabulous Marcel from Brussels stands out among all the others.
First of all, by his flamboyant name - although he is known as &#39;Marcel&#39; - which has to do with sport since he takes the name, according to legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
The &#39;Marcel&#39; stands out from the others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive logo and for the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the best known undershirts have in the neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tank tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it is a pity to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
Second assault for Honda&#39;s super sales
In November Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitability, this new MPV has an even larger interior space.
Added to this are some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
So this is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz presents a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before looking at the new model, it should be pointed out that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the first generation was put on the market.
First of all we observe that Honda has renovated this model in a shorter time than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe the Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a sales phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Specifically in Japan, almost a million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less one million cars sold in six years, is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it plans to sell 100,000, which would represent a sales growth of 17% on the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002, which represents 6.7% of Honda sales in Spain.
The managers of the Spanish subsidiary hope to sell 2,000 Jazz in one year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely compensate for the drop in sales in Spain.
Indeed, those responsible for the brand hope to end the year with sales of 22,000 cars, ie 4,000 cars less than in 2007, ie a drop in sales of 16%.
Thanks to this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to achieve a 2% market share in 2010.
Honda hopes to get that market share when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a hybrid with five doors and a compact size - 4.37 meters in length - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars per year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer&#39;s estimates, 50% of Insight sales will be in the United States, while the remaining half will be split between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change, i.e. 1.52 meters.
The dimensions increase and so does the interior space.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a petrol reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Likewise, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - can hold up to 399 litres, 19 liters more capacity than the trunk of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 liters.
The other innovation - in addition to exterior elements such as rear lights or the panoramic roof - is improved access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the rear doors of the first Jazz which opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of the Jazz.
At the start of its marketing, this small model will be equipped with two gasoline engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines feature i-VTEC technology which reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2-liter engine develops 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This thruster - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 liters per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous thruster, which on the previous generation reached 83 horsepower, now reached 100 horsepower.
This 100 horsepower Honda Jazz 1.4L has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
&quot;I want to become a young mother; the candidate does not worry me&quot;
Her enormous resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters are taking their new business in fashion very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their names.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand did in Paris at its new headquarters, as well as at the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you are doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I have created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the &#39;Mango Fashion Awards&#39; and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
A very intense but, at the same time, exciting day awaits us.
What is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season based on?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s enchants us and we draw a lot of inspiration from them for our collections.
I really like walking around town and observing women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do that often.
Dancer, actress and designer, you are a very versatile woman: aren&#39;t you?
I think so but in the end everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Ever since I was little I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother&#39;s to look in my aunt&#39;s closets and see her clothes.
It was awesome, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers really like to dress well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you put on the clothes, that&#39;s when you really put yourself in the character&#39;s shoes.
So everything is connected.
You turned 30 not long ago: was it hard for you?
No way.
I feel better than ever, my 30 years make me happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with fewer problems.
The biological clock does not scare me.
I did all the things I wanted to do from a very young age and it gave me a lot of internal happiness.
So, are you thinking of becoming a mother?
Of course, I want to become a mother because my body asks me to and, moreover, I want to become a young mother; I don&#39;t want to lose that.
As for the candidate, I&#39;m not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let&#39;s come to the cinema, you&#39;re waiting for the different films you shot last year to come out.
It&#39;s true, I can&#39;t wait for them to come out.
I who am a woman from the theater, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I can&#39;t wait for the films &#39;La última hora&#39; and &#39;En busca de la tumba de Cristo&#39; to come out.
To see what you will think of it…
A few days ago you started on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell, didn&#39;t you?
Do not say that !
I didn&#39;t go up on the catwalk to model.
Quite simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I&#39;ve known her for quite some time, to invite me to take part in a charity parade in London for her association in favor of supporting women and the clothes that we exhibited - I exhibited two garments from our collection created for Mango - were auctioned off to raise money for Naomi&#39;s NGO.
People that Naomi is a soft-hearted person.
They say so many things about her, I know her, a lot of things are not true.
Moreover, this so good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the handstand, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for Third World women.
The &#39;bee car&#39; that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for the prevention of accidents, Nissan was inspired, this time, by nature, in particular bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot which, by imitating the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
It&#39;s called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, and represents the first steps in collision avoidance technologies.
Engineers from the Advanced Technical Center of Nissan Motor Co. made this little robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, general manager of PR for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan Safety Shield.
This robot will enable the brand&#39;s vehicles to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space in an oval shape that closely resembles the Nissan security shield.
But most important are the bee&#39;s compound eyes, which can see over 300 degrees and in all directions, allowing it to fly uninterrupted within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers developed something called a Laser Range Finder.
This detects obstacles within a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
&quot;The moment it detects an obstacle, the little robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the evasive maneuver is totally instinctive.
If this were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Movement Laboratory and main engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be hijacked up or down, or diagonally; he can only move in two dimensions and according to what his wheels allow him and not in infinite directions like the bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a function of rotation, but also of acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
“Every second this device only needs to process information and act on that data.
It does not need to store information or intuitive logics of previous operations, which is why it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
It may come as a surprise, but we&#39;re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes.&quot;
This represents the first development of new instant collision avoidance technologies, a technology that will be introduced in production cars in about ten years according to Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device on a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles on the road.
Repeat drink-driving offenders will have to install the &#39;alcolock&#39; system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative sanctions for alcohol, to have to install in his vehicle a system which prevents starting the vehicle in a state of intoxication, or if he is not breathing.
The initiative was already announced last June and it now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered as a pilot project which will last one year.
Its aim is the reintegration of the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State in charge of road safety but also the General Directorate of Road Safety and the Technological Institute Foundation for Automobile Safety will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for having driven more than once in a state of intoxication, take the car back.
The alcolock would avoid this since it is a system connected to the vehicle which measures the alcohol level in the breath and prevents the vehicle from being started if the driver does not breathe before; or when the driver&#39;s alcohol level is higher than permitted.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is the responsibility of the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of violations during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people each year.
This measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviors before they turn into criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be made by ordinary means but, however, the reform made by criminal means requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and service vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party which proposes to install this system in school buses, as has been done in France.
In Mexico without &#39;peep-toes&#39;
At precisely 5:40 p.m., the official scheduled time, the Spanish Air Force plane in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling landed in the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve of setting but its rays still forced us to put our hands up as a visor to be able to see the royal couple getting off the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver in the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to end their official journey.
- Ah, fine, so we won&#39;t be able to go to the airport to pick up clients at this time... Are you from here or...?
- No, no sir, I&#39;m Spanish but I lived here for two years.
- Ah. Very good…
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are several of them waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and at a military row of 27 marines.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, while the Princess has her hair blowing in the wind, is dressed very soberly and does not wear her usual &#39;peep-toes&#39;; perhaps they had told him that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before going into the room where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny journalist from Mexican television is waiting for them.
They are afraid of being mortgaged
It must be recognized that the Treasury of the United States, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make plans, is not devoid of geniuses.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn how not to go bankrupt: &#39;Bad Credit Hotel&#39;.
That is to say &#39;the hotel of bad credits&#39; ... or stories.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Maître d&#39;Hôtel leads us to think several times if it is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
It is sure that this game gives useful but not very detailed information.
It&#39;s more of a game for teenagers.
¿What if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It&#39;s better than nothing, since it&#39;s unthinkable to buy a house
Fashion&#39;s most prestigious award
There is surely no better place in the world to present a fashion award than Paris and there is surely no more extraordinary and good living designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in the window of Mango at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she almost cried with emotion.
Admittedly, it is the brand&#39;s second largest store in Europe which has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface area.
The first store is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the designer Valentino, president of the jury of the contest, made that we found ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the Garnier opera in Paris.
With the neighboring table of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having a heavy heart and having a good heart against bad luck, because of the recent death of his brother, Nati put on a Mango garment and some ELAH adornments, which took her breath away, and arm in arm below with her son Luis - a handsome man almost two meters tall - she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Baron de Rotchil ended the evening without jackets because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store with pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner transformed into a sexy long black dress, was moved when during the nocturnal visit of opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet rehearsal room and remembering the good old days, she grabbed one of the poles and made a &#39;grand plie&#39; gesture.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the palace&#39;s outbuildings, but she showed us before on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The following morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another handsome man who travels by motorbike – and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having asked the beforehand, that there are no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh dear, that&#39;s life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and the frenzy of everyday life.
And to top it off, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to booksellers on September 30.
The alarm clock almost saddens us when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it&#39;s even worse when we think of the hectic pace that today&#39;s life imposes on us.
The office is synonymous with tension and the computer with back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and the problems linked to the world of work.
But 1001, neither one more nor one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or &#39;spa&#39; treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole &#39;menu&#39; of methods adapted to everyone&#39;s taste and time.
The anti-stress work is called &#39;1001 Ways to Relax&#39; and will arrive in booksellers direct from the Pearson Alhambra and DK publisher.
If anyone believes that it is not possible to obtain peace in places like work or through personal relationships, this &#39;manual&#39; disproves such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline isn&#39;t racing through your veins to restore balance to your body and stress has become an issue, it&#39;s time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading. .
talking while sleeping
A few children talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up wide awake telling us about something that happened the day before, but to children who talk in their sleep.
The first time it happens it may surprise you, but in reality it doesn&#39;t matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep which is called somniloquy.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
It is sure that there is more than one who speaks during the night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in a lifetime, for example, associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month, etc.), the day after the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its occurrence
They are often linked to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal enuresis (wetting the bed) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have already said before, they can also be associated with very high fevers, situations of stress or over-excitement.
Either way, it&#39;s a little-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also highly variable.
He may speak with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, whispers or on the contrary with cries, tears, long speeches...
In case the sleep talking becomes very frequent, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and in order to obtain an explanation for this problem. .
We said it&#39;s a mild impairment, so there&#39;s no treatment unless it&#39;s related to another sleep impairment that can be cured (for example, if it&#39;s related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore look for quiet games and avoid programs or television series that are more or less violent.
With children who are very nervous and find it difficult to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as sleep talking appears try to remain calm.
Remember that they are harmless for the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful tips
Don&#39;t wake him up.
It&#39;s useless since he&#39;s unconscious and you would wake him up.
Even if he talks, he sleeps and therefore rests.
Remember that if he shows himself very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or to check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is unusual), don&#39;t be tempted to question him for information.
You won&#39;t get anything, because while sleeping, he is not conscious to be able to organize his thoughts.
Also, you&#39;ll hear what he&#39;s saying, but you won&#39;t know what he&#39;s dreaming about, so be careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to find out his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s nothing too bad, it&#39;s an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern has finally found its way to victory on its home turf after a long period of scarcity.
Without putting on a great match, the Yellows and Blacks created the greatest number of chances and managed to convert one to win the match.
The rhythm was not very sustained during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty in expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by visitor captain Kauffmann who grazed the skylight on a long shot, Illhaeusern was going to take the ascendancy slightly and in turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn above, Romain with his toe or Diebold came to tickle the defense of Dannemarie.
Opposite, we were blocking in midfield and we just left the restless Riahi at the forefront of the attack.
The start of the second half was going to be decisive with first two chances signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opener for the Illhousiens by Marais, well positioned to recover a ball pushed back on a first attempt by Diebold (53rd&#39;).
But the Illhousiens striker will not be able to savor his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates outnumbered.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose any major problems for an Illhousian Eleven who has just moved back a little to &quot;compact&quot; his defense, except in the very last seconds of the game when, after a big mess, the ball passed very near the transverse.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
Faced with the show of force of the fishermen who severely disrupted access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec, in Finistère, on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives there.
The latter have promised to welcome him &quot;in a constructive spirit&quot; and hope that he &quot;will come with concrete proposals&quot;.
A presidential visit which falls at the same time as a general assembly of the &quot;crisis committee&quot; created by Breton fishermen to obtain measures in the face of soaring diesel prices, which have reached a record at more than 1.14 euros per liter on average.
According to Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president &quot;will discuss with them the solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the employment conditions and remuneration of sailors&quot;.
Nicolas Sarkozy is eagerly awaited by fishermen.
Tuesday morning, they carried out snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The Quiberon marina was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île were not stopped.
A filter dam has been set up on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning, at dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d&#39;Olonne, in Vendée, where the trawlers remained at the quay, or in Le Havre, where around twenty boats blocked the movements of merchant ships.
Fishermen from La Turballe and Le Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique, stopped the blockade of the major Total refinery in Donges in the evening.
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait for Wednesday&#39;s meeting at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
At Guilvinec, the &quot;crisis committee&quot; must indeed decide on Tuesday what follow-up to give to the movement and its participation in the interview scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials from the national fisheries committee, which did not support their movement.
&quot;The strike will continue&quot; because &quot;the fishermen will not let go&quot; and &quot;do not wish to travel to Paris&quot;, for example announced Liliane Cariou, the president of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay around 50 cents per liter but they estimate that the break-even point for a boat is only reached with diesel fuel below 0.30 euros per liter .
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable singer of &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Kid&quot; died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and even Sam Mendes greeted the legend of cinema and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 planes delivered this year despite the threat of recession hanging over the global economy.
The world&#39;s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, is maintaining its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, reaffirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft in the range from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider selling more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which the American monetary authorities have bailed out, plans to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to reimburse the 85 billion dollars which have been advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and its retirement activity in the United States, specifies the newspaper which cites sources familiar with the matter.
AIG&#39;s board of directors met on Sunday evening to consider possible divestitures, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
Assets AIG is considering divesting include its air leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its property portfolio and private equity investments, the FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on these transfers, continues the FT.
AIG must quickly generate cash to repay the 85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of seeing the American authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders in due proportion.
Analysis Paris Session history Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange suffered a historic fall on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson bank bailout plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the biggest fall in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on September 17, 2001, the day trading resumed after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The tech-dominated Nasdaq index fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the broader Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500 index 8.81% (or 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points, according to final figures. Closing.
Already depressed at the start of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the bank bailout plan which was to restore some stability to the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 for, the representatives refused Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he was asking for.
Nearly two in three Republicans rejected his plan.
&quot;It&#39;s a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,&quot; said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“It shows how much the market was counting on this plan,” she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would come “too late”.
“If the project is indeed moribund (…) then the baton will be passed quickly to the Fed (the American central bank, note) and to the other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions”, has warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, “every passing day brings the fall of a financial institution” in the United States, underlined Ms. Piegza.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the takeover of the banking activities of Wachovia by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, prompting emergency interventions in favor of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are facing &quot;not only an American crisis, but to a global crisis,&quot; added the FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market rose sharply.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.632%, from 3.827% on Friday evening, and that of 30 years to 4.161%, from 4.357% the day before.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the entry in turn of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will spend nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a news greeted by a sharp drop in its share price.
A week after unveiling a tentative deal, the two banks said MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common stock at $25.25 each, for a total of $3 billion.
The price retained is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible securities providing it with a yield of 10% and accompanied by a conversion price of 31.25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley specified that the global operation would be carried out on the basis of an average unit price of 29 dollars, or 28% above its current price.
However, Morgan Stanley shares lost 6.79% to 23.07 dollars around 5:00 p.m. GMT.
&quot;This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley&#39;s transition to bank holding company status,&quot; said John Mack, CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow it to diversify its activities but put it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday further show that the deal has been tweaked over the past few days: Last Monday, Morgan simply announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for around $8.5 billion.
&quot;A week ago, explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, &quot;we thought that the participation would be entirely made up of ordinary shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize the risks and hedge ourselves.&quot;
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of approximately 20% of earnings per share.
The deal provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred stock into common stock within a year if the stock trades more than 50% above the conversion price, or about $47, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group, however, refused to give details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG&#39;s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to post a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had &quot;significantly&quot; reduced its balance sheet since the end of August.
The past few weeks have been trying for the group, which has seen its share price drop by half as the cost of insurance against the risk of default on its debt soared.
This cost fell on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other &quot;survivor&quot; of the big Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett&#39;s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refound the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, it was the third to vote on a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted &quot;yes&quot; in the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of the vote.
According to these results, the &quot;no&quot; obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% were blank votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two surveys carried out at the exit of the polling stations and a count by a non-governmental organization had announced a large victory for the &quot;yes&quot;, placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The &quot;Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly&quot;, he assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians at the seat of the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The ballot, which took place calmly according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), concerned a 444-point text consolidating the &quot;new socialism&quot; defended by the president.
The draft Constitution consecrates the power of the State over the economy, by reserving to it the &quot;planning of the development&quot; of a country living essentially from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the currencies sent by its emigrants.
Carried by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants reinforced powers to the Head of State, who will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the possibility of dissolving the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek re-election in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
Obama, winner on points of the first televised duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House was followed by another to find out who, John McCain or Barack Obama, won.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in the televised duel that was reportedly watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain&#39;s performance, although honorable, was not &quot;brilliant&quot; enough to allow him to stem his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% against 44% for McCain), judges that it is the Democrat who has pulled out of the game.
Among undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama emerged victorious for 39% of those polled, while 25% of them grant victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected good performance of his running mate, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
&quot;It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She has good instincts”, however warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The septuagenarian McCain never ceased to highlight his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while underlining the &quot;naivety&quot; of his opponent on these questions which were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
&quot;Senator Obama doesn&#39;t seem to understand that...&quot; he repeatedly accused.
&quot;I don&#39;t believe Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president,&quot; he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican television advertisements.
Obama himself stressed that he represented the future.
Without disassembling, he was concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
&quot;McCain still hasn&#39;t understood, while Obama has,&quot; retorted a Democratic spot this weekend accusing the Republican of not having taken the full measure of the impact of the crisis on the &quot; Street American&quot;.
“During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, denounced Obama yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered for an election rally in North Carolina in the pouring rain .
He didn&#39;t even utter the words &#39;middle class&#39; or &#39;working class.
“The coming week could be a watershed moment,” influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said yesterday.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a veteran of the Clinton administration, compared Obama&#39;s &quot;good economic instincts&quot; to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle &quot;is the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain&quot;.
Reaffirming that he would still manage to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the upheavals on Wall Street, the Illinois senator also pointed out that the achievement of the country&#39;s eventual energy independence through the promotion of renewable energies was its first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain wanted to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Cautious, the two candidates dodged questions about the financial rescue plan of 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros) adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, &quot;you noticed that there was an election, did you?&quot;
Young people and opponents demonstrated Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislative elections.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered Sunday evening as soon as the polling stations closed in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While no result had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: &quot;the dictator, resign&quot;.
Some admit that they did not even vote: &quot;What&#39;s the point, since they will do what they want with my voice&quot;, says a young person.
They do not believe that the regime, which has made a good impression on foreign observers with the aim of regaining contact with the European Union, is ready to make a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including a visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered clean by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
&quot;We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to take part in the counting,&quot; lamented Yuri Potemkin, spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
&quot;It&#39;s a cosmetic change, underlines Alexandre Milinkevich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and for us, it&#39;s executive power.
If opposition deputies enter parliament, it means that they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and proposals for legislation.&quot;
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because &quot;we must start the dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.&quot;
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the electoral process, will recognize the validity of the ballot.
She stresses that the turnout figures seem too high, and that the generalization of advance voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way to all kinds of manipulation.
“You noticed there was an election, did you?” asks Social Democrat leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners freed in August this year.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition deputies in parliament, those who are best suited to power.&quot;
The silence of the night falls on October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault against the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon safe and sound.
In the morning, they had been released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in good shape, the hostages arrived around 3:30 p.m. aboard a special plane at the al-Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, by helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, to undergo examinations.
They are in &quot;good health&quot;, and &quot;no ransom has been paid&quot; to the kidnappers&quot;, declared on the tarmac the Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garanna.
Captured on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been tossed from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers .
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous agency, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 special forces personnel, flown in two helicopters, launched the assault overnight just before dawn.
“An exchange of gunfire occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fleeing,” said the official, who requested anonymity.
He said that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces &quot;flash&quot; unit had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned from Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
&quot;We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our secret service men, special forces,&quot; he said, without further details.
He also denied paying a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have intercepted during a patrol a 4x4 vehicle aboard which the kidnappers were, killing six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army claimed they were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Unity (SLA-U), which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture is making headlines and occupying this election campaign.
So much the better.
But a sector of our cultural life always remains forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable sums that are granted to small museums, archives, archaeological digs or national historic sites that are dying of hunger?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government that it is neglecting its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don&#39;t have real laws effectively preserving our heritage?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to the restoration of the only castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Among our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and that, in consultation.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Quebec Historical Societies, at least 40,000 volunteers grouped in 211 historical, heritage, archival and genealogical societies are concerned with digging into history, preserving with three pennies heaps of private archives and to preserve archaeological remains.
They are often the watchdogs of our heritage, protesting with the energy of despair when promoters and decision-makers launch their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a forum for history and heritage?
The Interview - Blood Made Safe Again
Héma-Québec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he won back the public trust that had been seriously shaken by the tainted blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, the national blood supplies managed by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Service were contaminated with the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and the discontent of the public, the Government of Canada instituted a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, an inquiry which aimed to shed light on the circumstances which led to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations so that such a disaster does not happen again.
While Judge Krever was late in submitting his report, some provinces then set up a committee with the objective of planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and Canadian Blood Services to supply all the other provinces and the two territories.
“In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
By dint of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work in the field during the years that followed, we regained the confidence of the public&quot;, she says before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that &quot;trust is something extremely fragile&quot;.
Since its creation on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we were witnessing in Europe the outbreak of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says the one who has held the fort since its foundation in 1998.
&quot;And we had no idea if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
We then relied on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know it and that a serious illness may result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is characterized by degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, exclusion measures are instituted.
In April 1999, therefore, blood was refused from people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
However, a few years ago, it was demonstrated beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle that we applied made sense.&quot;
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV screening technique appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (NAT), which allow the presence of the virus itself to be detected directly in the blood of donors and not that of antibodies against it. the virus, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have made it possible to shorten the silent period, which extends between the moment when the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period to less than a week.
We have thus substantially reduced the risk that certain donors are infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements have considerably reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
“In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission through a blood product occurs.
I believe that today we can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover our health,” says the CEO of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
Just last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on Reunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
You have to be constantly vigilant,” continues Dr. Décary before emphasizing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also plan for a sufficient supply.
&quot;The needs are increasing because the population is aging.
Since cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a refill of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has consequences for the network of blood donors, which only includes on average 3% of Quebecers who are eligible to donate blood.
Anyone in good health, aged 18 and over who meets the eligibility criteria, can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is rife, they will be excluded for a one year period.
“With this 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this network of donors as they age and can no longer give blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today&#39;s life is so hectic, we rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood,&quot; laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burned.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Québec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered biomedical waste is teeming with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious illnesses, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the banking of our thousandth cord blood sample and we plan to collect more than a thousand a year.
We should start offering them for transplants at the beginning of next year,” says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood collection program as very popular.
&quot;Several mothers are disappointed not to be able to have access to it&quot;, because Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in the semi-finals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the USL First Division playoffs, thanks to a 3-1 win (4-3 on aggregate) over the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, in the second and decisive game of the quarter-final series on total goals, at Stade Saputo.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of play.
After a scoreless first half on either side, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other goals for the Montreal squad.
Roger Levesque was the only one to beat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that in the first game of the home and away series, Friday, the Impact lost 2-1 at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder overcame a 3-1 deficit in the second leg to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still advanced to the semi-final round 5-4 on aggregate.
The Impact is scheduled to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but series details will be confirmed today.
In brief - Kovalev&#39;s winning goal
The number one trio of the Canadian is ready to begin the season.
The unit made up of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 victory for the Canadiens in the shootout against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the game&#39;s first star, scored a goal, Plekanec had two assists, and Kovalev had an assist in the win, the Habs&#39; fourth in six preseason games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal of the shootout.
&quot;I&#39;m not ready yet, warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable.&quot;
“He tried to do too much in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the match.
He got a nice standing ovation.&quot;
Charest bets on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out calling an election before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (on the left), is trying to get elected on the occasion of the by-election today.
&quot;Pushing back the limits of our last great northern border&quot;: this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in broad outline, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis , yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a sort of Image Mill.
Looped, on three huge screens, spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by &quot;Google Maps&quot;, maps, etc.
Great means as in the election period.
In a press conference, moreover, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would call the elections this fall, even if he pointed out that his schedule was very busy.
The &quot;Plan Nord&quot; is the fourth part of a &quot;vision&quot; that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a &quot;new economic space&quot;, which includes a labor agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, confined himself to explaining why the North was &quot;a jewel with immense potential&quot;, but did not give a deadline, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
At most a few avenues of what could be further developed: in particular hydroelectricity, the forest, but above all the mining sector, boosted by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains &quot;nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond&quot;, according to Mr. Charest&#39;s enumeration.
This “territory twice the size of France”, “it is with us, it is in Quebec.
Not only is it with us, but it is in us”, he insisted, as if to show that he was seeking a national founding myth.
Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, he pointed out: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
&quot;It&#39;s ours, it&#39;s our future,&quot; he added, after pausing theatrically to gaze at the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the Prime Minister during the press briefing.
“It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and, when the opportunity arises, I reiterate this position on behalf of the government,” he said.
Moreover, &quot;with climate change, we have to rethink our vision of the North,&quot; he said of the Northwest Passage, which will be open all year round due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Premier said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former PQ MP for Ungava), have already begun consultations with some thirty communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a big meeting, &quot;not necessarily a summit&quot;, but a moment when &quot;we will give ourselves a common vision&quot;.
The development of the North would also be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Plan Nord will be &quot;concerted, orderly and respectful of the environment&quot;, he promised.
Jean Charest described this &quot;vision&quot; as being in continuity with that of Liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
&quot;Like the Liberals who came before us, we thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.&quot;
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a large cocktail party to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois power plant as the Adélard-Godbout dam.
&quot;From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party knew how to forge the future&quot;, declared Jean Charest .
In a press briefing, he invoked another reference, a conservative one, the &quot;Roads to the North&quot; program of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest pointed out that its commissioning was scheduled for 2012.
&quot;It stays between us there, but I plan to be there,&quot; he told his activists, prompting loud applause from them.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling a ballot this fall, which the law allow.
He points out that his schedule is however full, in particular by a mission of the council of the federation in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, in particular &quot;constitutional aspirations&quot; which passed like a letter in the mail: the PLQ in particular demands recognition of the &quot;specificity of Quebec&quot; in the Constitution.
He also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and for them to have the right to veto decisions made in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the broad lines of the Plan Nord were greeted with skepticism.
The PQ leader, Pauline Marois, brought out the Nord-du-Québec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, gave up applying it.
If he had done so, &quot;we would be more advanced today&quot; commented Ms. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (election taking place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supported the adoption of a Plan Nord by the government.
&quot;But what we want is that it&#39;s not just a show,&quot; commented leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - A Disgraced Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, ex-minister of &quot;Justice&quot; (oh irony) in the Harper cabinet, who allowed himself last summer to say of Louise Arbor that she was a &quot;shame&quot; for Canada.
Casting opprobrium on this woman who waged a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration says as much about the Prime Minister&#39;s entourage as it does about Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government which is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated its national imprisoned in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the facts with which he is accused.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, goes back on its word and allows a child soldier to rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a travesty of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Remember, for the record, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, plead for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can benefit from a fair trial in Canada.
It is this same government that turns a blind eye to torture: it matters little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of abuse.
We don&#39;t realize it yet, but we are currently witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our &quot;democracy&quot;, this word that Harper keeps brandishing and which rings so hollow in his mouth. .
The time has come when no morality no longer exists: we can manhandle, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the goodwill of a head of government who has been in a minority up to now (what will happen after 14 october...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold&#39;s Orwellian Discourse
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, executive vice-president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing Orwellian logic, he claims that the world&#39;s largest gold company has filed a six million libel suit against three authors and a small, penniless publishing house in a bid to launch a &quot;transparent public debate&quot;. .
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation suits, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets. of mining.
The tactic in these unequal struggles is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that will gag the opposition in addition to frightening anyone who dares to look into the matter again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have presented its view of the facts before public opinion.
Contrary to what is done in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, the debates in Canada are normally made by the exchange of ideas and not by beatings with truncheons.
It was therefore enough for the mining company to open its books, its files and to establish a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent research teams which could have shed light on the question. .
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust public opinion and rejects out of hand the petitions and letters of support to the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can both demand &quot;public&quot; debate while disregarding the opinions of that same public?
In the world of the vice-president, it seems that this word refers only to highly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even critics have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so above all because they reject the brutal way of mining.
This public is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in what many perceive as a SLAPP (continuing the &quot;public debate&quot;, Barrick Gold has just elsewhere to file a formal notice to the authors of Noir Canada ordering them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver&#39;s surreal rhetoric, the Barrick Gold lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the search for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, en bloc, the right to citation of credible sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the wealthy companies of this world in a country like Canada, under penalty of repeated lawsuits, who will be able to do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right of reply.
The academic world, to which we belong, has a long history of managing debates and disagreements and resolving conflicts.
Barrick Gold&#39;s outsized pursuit makes it clear that, contrary to what it claims, it has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for academia, as it is for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms to limit this kind of frivolous prosecution.
Wall Street Bailout - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the 700 billion US dollar plan aimed at curbing the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months must still be ratified by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for: better control by elected officials of its application, new mechanisms aimed at ensuring the reimbursement of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right to inspect the salaries paid to the managers of the companies rescued.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative at the negotiating table Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
&quot;We have made great strides toward an agreement that will work in the marketplace,&quot; Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
“Everything was done in a way to shield the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street,” the Democrat explained.
&quot;That&#39;s the bottom line: If we don&#39;t do this, the trauma, chaos, and disruption to the daily lives of Americans will be immense,&quot; Republican Judd Gregg said.
The negotiations had turned into a sprint in the last hours for fear of the effect that another failure would have on the mood of investors.
The time limit that we agreed to was the opening of the markets this morning.
Belatedly associated with the negotiations, the two candidates for the American presidential election showed themselves to be rather favorable to the agreement, without however failing to express their dissatisfaction that we are obliged to come to this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has claimed the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, in particular that aimed at allowing owners to keep their homes and that on the salary of the leaders of companies rescued by the State.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary,” he commented on American television.
Asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: &quot;I would like to see the details, but I hope so.&quot;
&quot;The outline that I&#39;ve read [shows] that it&#39;s something that we&#39;re all going to have to digest and move on with.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to buy back with taxpayers&#39; money the bad debts, risky and unsellable assets of American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble which first led to the collapse of subprime mortgage loans before spreading to other more widespread forms of credit securities (ABCP) and lead to a freeze of liquidity and the rout of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of elected Republicans who had derailed the first draft agreement last week.
This impasse is believed to have been broken since the Democrats agreed that certain &quot;toxic&quot; assets of ailing companies should only be insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to smooth things over for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision stipulating that if the government had to bear losses for five years with this program, it could introduce new taxes to help it recover his bet.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of 250 billion to which another 100 billion may be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion should be ratified by another vote of Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will obtain stakes in the rescued companies which will earn him dividends in the event of a profit and which he can resell when the turmoil is over.
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying the procedures for foreclosures concerning the housing attached to the mortgages concerned by this plan, as well as setting limits on the remuneration and severance pay paid to the managers of the companies affected.
The plan&#39;s architects would like to see it voted on by the House of Representatives today, and by the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite their best efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be given the green light.
Voices have indeed continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camps.
&quot;Obviously Washington can&#39;t hear you,&quot; Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents.
&quot;Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists of taking advantage of the taxpayers”.
Leader of a small group in Congress dubbed &quot;the caucus of skeptics&quot;, Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
&quot;Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us saying: Congress is asked not to rush and to carefully consider the way forward,&quot; he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again proof of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was giving up acquiring its competitor in the midst of the sinking since it lost 2 billion euros. euros (2.9 billion US) in the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
&quot;It&#39;s not wasted money,&quot; Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In exchange, we get a right to vote in the bank and some influence.
It&#39;s just something that savers and households appreciate now that times are going to be uncertain.&quot;
Meanwhile, across the Channel, the British government appeared to be nationalizing another bank battered by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all the loans in progress at the Bradford and Bringley bank, including more than 41 billion (75.5 billion US) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
Her beauty with azure eyes was for a long time her trump card, some would say her weakness.
Had he freed himself from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that flowed from source will also have distanced him from the register of power that gives birth to the real sacred monsters.
But what a great long-distance runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer on his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema from the boom years.
Less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a sort of rival on screen, more cautious in his acting, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the bursting of dramatic conventions.
Mixed bloods often make beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German-Jewish father and a Hungarian-born mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, ultimate mark of quality.
Because in him was projected a whole country in love with the self-made man, the combatant of the Pacific war, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied drama at Yale then attended the Actor&#39;s Studio in New York, before to triumph in the theatre, on television, soon in the cinema.
This same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the racing driver who finished second in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled as a sex symbol, although member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappear with him the gray areas of this secret star, discreet, committed, allergic to the splinters of show business, whose enigma we will not have completely pierced.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the term.
The disappearance of Paul Newman has given moviegoers vertigo this weekend, as his great roles clash on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of a perpetually changing seventh American art scrolls through him.
The memory of the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Pussy on a Hot Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958, comes back to haunt.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all its promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by hatred), by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, resumed after his death, which really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic thug in the brilliant The Sting (The Scam), Oscar for best film in 1973.
Bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen&#39;s magnificent The Hustler (1961), he would take up the character on his return in Martin Scorsese&#39;s The Color of Money, which in 1987 earned him his only Oscar out of nine nominations.
This face through the ages was him.
Him again.
The eras jostle through his career.
Young people know him especially through George Roy Hill&#39;s cult Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen brothers.
With a final role as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes in 2003, the circle was complete.
Contrary to several cinema legends who gave up the profession quite early, Newman will have remained in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its splendor and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, &quot;as a living challenge to the&quot; underplaying &quot;judging his performances too strong.
The profession has not always been kind to the handsome Paul Newman, whose roles fell into his mouth for a long time.
However, he played less often the young first than the marginalized: neurotics, alcoholics, bastards or despairing, whose perfect features reflected the excesses and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known facets of his true modest sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine feminine portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
Among the rain of tributes that swept over Newman yesterday, his great friend and former comrade in arms Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) affirmed, very saddened: &quot;His presence made my life and this country better.&quot;
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the late actor.
Beyond his legendary career, also fades a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of the excesses of Hollywood.
We will have seen many of his smiles enthroned on jars of vinaigrette, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process to be in rather bad taste, although gag at the start.
Proceeds from these sales were nonetheless donated to his Special Needs Foundation.
Newman, rather than sitting on his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: &quot;Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege to be there.&quot;
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Model citizen, in sum and in addition.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Compagnie manufacture in their invoice factory?
Soon, on October 8, the hearings relating to the ongoing criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, having caused particularly significant damage. Other charges were brought against them, such as forgery and use of forgery.
According to the prosecution, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money from the state and the municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, went on the one hand into the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other hand into the pockets of certain people.
Their method, also made public by the authorities in charge of the investigation, was to receive the money from the subsidies obtained by issuing expense invoices, behind which no real service was provided and thus the associations never respected their commitments. .
According to the indictment, many of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they obtained invoice books at the Józsefváros market, while they made the seals at Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that were going to appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the rounds in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the statement of the latter, he had to locate pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model of which they produced the other invoices that they were going to submit, among others, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor, as well as of the Capital Municipality to access subsidies.
Most of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András Őri, who, according to our information, was mainly responsible for drafting the files necessary to obtain the subsidies.
During a &quot;scouting tour&quot;, one of Lados&#39; choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place provided catering for a group of 90 people, members of the Biztos Pont Egyesület association.
However, according to the words of the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up in the name of the Jobb Jövőért foundation, which would later bear the name of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, was full of errors of form and substance.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there. However, the invoice mentioned one hundred and thirty customers.
The imaginative invoice issuers also went overboard when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounts, neither the name of Jobb Jövőért, nor that of Hoppá appeared, according to information given to the prosecution.
Győző Farkas, the company&#39;s manager, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor&#39;s office summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew right away that they were forged documents.
&quot;Our company name and tax number were placed in the wrong place on the stamp.&quot;
He added: &quot;Beyond the form, the fact that according to the invoice, one hundred people stayed there, did not fit either, since this establishment only has eleven rooms, which do not have as much space.
In addition, the invoice also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time.&quot;
Zealous billers also did not inquire about Budapest travel agencies, being among their choice, but only organizing trips abroad. Thus, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency.
Moreover, as it appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT to these documents, whereas the services relating to travel activities, the destination of which is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices issued in the name of Hotel Révfülöp to the order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the company&#39;s services do not bear a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15 %. In addition, hotel employees only issue printed invoices, while fake ones were written by hand.
The prosecutor&#39;s investigation reveals that the &quot;issuers&quot; also made mistakes by mentioning the transport of goods by road as a service, which the company issuing the invoices could not perform, given that its profile was investment advice.
In addition, it is also for formal defects, such as incorrect types of invoices and false stamps, that the invoices issued to the order of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and de Biztos Pont turned out to be false.
As in the case of the Ravenna Bt. company or the Kunfehértó sports camp, both of which deny being the authors of the invoices issued in their name.
Nor did the counterfeiters pay attention to the fact that HIB Kft., based in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation when (in 2001) the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group was supposed to have a meal at their house. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of the company denies having issued this invoice.
Deliberately established invoices
Another category of invoice issuers are those who were fully aware that they were being asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány foundation, at the request of the group of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued an invoice to the order of the Együtt foundation in Harmadik Évezredért, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab Kft. was led to issue false invoices by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi.
Likewise, cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices to the order of the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the association Vörösfenyő Egyesület, for an amount of approximately five million HUF, but behind which no benefits were actually provided.
No financial movement took place, either, since the invoices issued were subsequently canceled, but the organizations avoided mentioning this in their accounts.
The next category of billing companies are companies directly related to the defendants.
So, the administrative delegate of the general director of the company Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose head office was in Budapest, but where he could not be found there, was Iván Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, this company issued several invoices concerning the sale of computer equipment, for an amount of approximately 18 million HUF.
According to the investigation, this equipment would have been purchased by the company Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since September 14, 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Iván Kubatov would also have sent documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued invoices to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and de Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he pocketed their equivalent value.
It was precisely at the request of Iván Kubatov that Romanian masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In reality, none of these companies were functioning, which the accused explains by the fact that they did not receive any work.
He nevertheless used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-defendant as well as drafter of the deeds of foundation of the companies, he established invoices in their names, to the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as the Atlasz and Y-Generáció associations.
Kubatov gave organizations a total of 15 invoices, issued by the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The prosecution believed that 10% of the sums indicated on the invoices as well as the VAT went into Kubatov&#39;s pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to draw up fictitious invoices which were used as part of Biztos Pont&#39;s grant application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció Association and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért applied for a grant from the socialist party&#39;s public benefit body, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They obtained this grant for an amount of twice 500,000 HUF, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To prevent this from becoming known, five fictitious invoices received from the company Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, these are the invoices that were found during the search carried out in the office of Árpád Kemecsei, at the Ministry of Education.
During the hearing, some of the defendants will recount the method of production of the invoices, as they had already done before the prosecution previously.
What could be really interesting would be that the main defendant, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil on the whole story.
So far, his confession is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to recount the finer details, he has yet to do so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or perhaps the socialists would have reached an agreement whereby in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would carry the blame alone.
Today, the latter is probably upset, since the requests for his placement under house arrest, on the basis of an alleviation of his conditions of detention, continually fall on deaf ears.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of irreparable economic crimes, walk around freely or at least wait in their own homes for the end of the procedure. He does not have this possibility.
The psychology of one-upmanship: why are we spending more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to overspend and overprice the merchandise.
Neurology and economics researchers at New York University have successfully unearthed the neurological and economic underpinnings of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be left behind in this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that is why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
This research has attempted to draw a neurological diagram of this kind of &quot;game&quot; using experimental auctions.
One of the groups of volunteers played lotto, while the other group took part in a fun auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) process, the researchers analyzed the active brain domains experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could win money, but during the auction, an essential element of which is the one-third overbid, the assembly below the brainstem, called the striatum, moved from intensively when the game is lost.
This part of the brain, alongside several other functions, plays a role in the &quot;self-stimulating&quot; mechanism of the nervous system.
This is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained with the escape from the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economist members of this group of researchers have pursued financial monitoring analyses.
During these, three groups outbid a partner, in various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the real value of the product in question, and they thus made their bet.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they won the game, then they would receive an additional 15 dollars, as a reward.
While the third group received these 15 dollars before the auction, but the members of the group also lost this money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the accent was placed in one on victory, while in the other, on failure.
In thus proving the neurologists&#39; hypothesis, the members of the team of players &quot;against failure&quot; were willing to wager higher than those made by the control group and the group &quot;for the victory&quot;.
&quot;These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them only explained the phenomena observed during auctions by the pleasure of winning and the parade in the face of risk.
Only neuroimaging methods have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories, now leading to a third explanation.&quot; - noted Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: when should we consult a doctor?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death.
It is estimated that 100,000 patients are carriers of the hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only 7,000 are receiving treatment. This is due to the fact that patients often do not know that they are carriers of the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but the pathogens and the diseases they cause differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the pathogen genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travelers, it is anyway recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating contaminated food, usually accompanied by poor general condition, weakness, stomach pain and nausea.
Then develops on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible jaundice, the stools become lighter and the urine takes on a darker color. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, each year, one million people die of the most serious form of this pathology, such as liver cancer or cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten patients receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know they are infected with the virus, because the pathogenic gene insidiously destroys liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, along with regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than average among a population of three groups: people who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattooed people.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic hepatitis type C in the world.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor as soon as you observe symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be cured, if detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing patients from all over the world.
Its purpose is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states come to the aid of the Belgo-Dutch bank, as the first European banking establishment in distress following the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalizing it. The three countries are supporting this financial and insurance institution, which also has interests in Hungary, to the tune of 11.2 billion euros.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments reached an agreement, at the highest level, in this matter, also calling on the European Central Bank and the European Commission&#39;s competition manager.
In the euro zone, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis, which has been growing for more than a year, is for the Fortis bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be made in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy back nearly half (up to 49%) of the bank&#39;s capital located in each of the countries.
The bank is undoubtedly going to sell part of its holdings, among which, in the first place, the activities, essentially insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch organization ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis shares began a steep drop. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis were already revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too big to be allowed to fail.
On Friday alone, the company&#39;s shares fell 12 percent to their lowest level of 14 years ago.
Since January, stocks have fallen by more than two-thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total capital value of the group is around 14 billion euros, which, according to the company&#39;s managers, is not realistic.
The company&#39;s management blames the uncertainty on the other side of the Atlantic, in connection with the adoption of the American bailout plan of 700 billion dollars, of being the cause of the fall in Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers have already benefited from a slight increase.
Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as the new managing director.
The financial organization was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the merits.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they were not going to lose their money.
No panic was felt in the circle of the bank&#39;s customers and no branch was attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also taken over leasing companies.
Does the one who believes in God feel less pain?
According to the results of recent research, religious belief would work as a kind of painkiller, which would have already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph published an article according to which researchers from the University of Oxford carried out an interesting experiment by analyzing at what level belief in God could influence the pain tolerance of human beings.
As part of this bizarre experience, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also possible to discover that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the regulation of pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiments, in which academicians, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experiment takes place as follows: an instrument emitting sparks and diffusing electroshocks is attached to the left hand of the experimental subject.
Researchers asked participants of the experiment to stare intently at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other being the Lady with an Ermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century. .
The researchers behind this experiment hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke some sort of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci&#39;s painting, not dissimilar to the first, focused on her soothing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, during which time they received 20 four-part electroshocks in succession, while looking at either the religious-themed painting or the more general-themed painting.
Catholics said that at the sight of the Virgin Mary they felt &quot;safe&quot;, as someone who was &quot;taken care of&quot; and they &quot;calmed down, and peace came over them&quot;.
At the sight of the painting with a religious theme, they reported 12% less pain than when they looked at Leonardo&#39;s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, thinks that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, among atheists, provided you find the appropriate photo.
&quot;We should find an image to which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father, for example,&quot; the psychologist said.
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of this research.
&quot;The practice of faith should change and in many cases does change our personality,&quot; Wright added.
After these excellent results, only the question remains, what would be the effect on the subjects&#39; pain regulation if believers were shown a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same caliber?
Would the sight of a higher quality Virgin Mary bring about better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On its tenth anniversary, Google says it can be found in people&#39;s pockets like the sky above their heads. He knows where they spent their holidays, which specialists they consult and what their areas of interest are.
However, this is still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people in the company.
As for the skeptics drawing a parallel with Orwell&#39;s vision of horror, they just don&#39;t see the essence of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google&#39;s main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that the founders of Google can respect their initial objective which sounded like this: &quot;Let us collect in a system all the information of the world!&quot;.
According to the Google leader interviewed, after ten years of global upheaval, they are still only at the beginning of their objectives to be able to process all information.
To the question: what will there be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like &quot;What could I do tomorrow?&quot; or &quot;What job would suit me best?&quot;. However, software will only be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first glance, when they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used during Internet searches, the IP address of the computer which launches the search and the pages subsequently consulted by the persons concerned are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can see what they searched for, what they clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, a program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will submit products and services to us on the basis of our previous declarations and our registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what is my work? ask users, who worry about Google&#39;s information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can cause fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or possibly revolt against power that may provoke a counter-reaction among Internet users.
It is however a confirmed fact that the terms searched are not only recorded, but in justified cases, they are transmitted to a third party, and in this kind of legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most resounding example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing an identification.
Internet users concerned about human rights could breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, arm in arm with the electronic legal protection organization EFF, proved its rights in court against the FBI. According to the judgment rendered, in the future, Google will still not be compelled by any point of the constitution to disclose information on the FBI&#39;s secret request of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms which it had won over the strengthening of the child protection law, passed several years earlier. But at the end of account, it is unable to obtain private user search lists or the entire list of websites and keywords for the past two months.)
Google&#39;s judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is castigated by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer when they start using Google services. Consequently, they attack them in the spirit of revolt which one manifests against the multinational corporations proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and its &quot;savages&quot; of enthusiasts, activists, and enthusiastic computer users popping up in many countries see Google as the next generation of big business, the &quot;hip corporation,&quot; for opposition to its rival, Microsoft, cataloged as an invader of the world because of Windows, and this, even if both are fighting for the same objective.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and the package of programs, continuously refreshed, have a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, facing the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what precisely web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword of recent years, is pulling behind it.
Indeed, web 2.0 is not about anything other than collaboration, that the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use the communication channels made available to us, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can maintain a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link these to other services, such as for example to Twinter, or to last.fm, listing his musical habits. . Then he can link these to a tracking system, like FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also keep blogs, in which automatically appear their most recent photo galleries that they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can see many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands at the sight of the morning photos, taken by the circle of mutual friends, with whom her unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the company that dismissed one of its employees, just for the sincere opinions that this one wrote on his blog about top management, we can be sure of one thing: the term privacy is totally to be reconsidered from These days.
Whoever lives an online life is made up of what he shows of himself, and this is how we can define the principle behind the behavior of young people today.
Anyone who wants to hide something, or at least wants to try to circumvent Google&#39;s monopoly, can do so (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but, at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace ).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them is not the least. Google online services, from word processing to image processing, to reading information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not attached to huge server farms and which do not assemble not our best profile, having existed until this day.
Public opinion is waiting, without really hiding it, for the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense advertising domains threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while the services introduced at an ever-increasing speed cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but for many other creators of computer programs.
However, critical observers find, alongside all this, contradictions with disturbing effects: for example, the top management of the company refused, in its entirety, the protests of the employees, after it had doubled the price of the company kindergarten and after the company deemed the daily multiple catering, taken at any time, too expensive. All this seems paltry next to the fact that already in 2006, Google acquiesced to the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all results that hurt good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company&#39;s internal rules, new services are not announced until they can be used. What is certain is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world to new points. While some think that Google&#39;s book and magazine scanning and archiving project is getting so big that the company will soon find itself facing the United States Supreme Court, others tremble before its system. Health, because in it, we can build a complete medical profit from our previous analysis results, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a DNA database may provide good raw material for the next generation of science fiction writers. The novel by acclaimed Cory Doctorow, written in Orwellian halftones, describes the future in which a man could be approached staggeringly through Google data alone.
Two miners helped remove traces of Ózd&#39;s double homicide
&quot;The police have summoned two minors for questioning in the Ózd double homicide case. According to well-founded suspicions, they helped to remove the traces of the crime.&quot; - said the spokesman of the police department of Borsod.
The young people have admitted the facts of which they are accused. For now, they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraphic Agency) are young girls, defend themselves freely.
Complicity in murder can lead to imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect in the Ózd double homicide, a 23-year-old local man, was remanded in custody on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicide, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it emerged that the 23-year-old owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and it was for this reason that he lured his creditor last Wednesday to a site in Ózd where he killed him and the man&#39;s 9-year-old granddaughter. .
According to information from the MTI, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his crimes hidden at the scene of the crime is proof of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the takeover of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered two hundred million euros, approximately five billion Czech crowns, for the redemption of 100% of the share package from the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Poles made despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in state hands.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wishes to dispose of more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech business daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer that has been made so far for the takeover of the Prague stock exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have made offers so far.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner, and did not rule out the fact that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated between 5 and 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
Based on an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent stake, followed by the 14.7 percent of the Ceská Sporitelna bank and the Tiger Holding Four S. arl with 13, 5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday devoted to the international financial crisis, worsening day by day, the leading newspapers of the European press already evoke a &quot;second September 11&quot;.
&quot;We owe the global financial disaster to the American president&quot; - accuses the Rome daily, La Repubblica. &quot;The president was not even able to unite with his own party behind a bill, improvised in a hurry, aimed at bringing relief to a desperate situation...&quot;
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, as the billionaire Warren Buffett mentioned, it is more appropriate to speak of a second 9/11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it is the shortcomings of the political leadership there that has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system increases every day, and thereafter, the whole world will pay a heavy price.
Bush&#39;s plan was far from perfect, however, according to the congressional vote, there is a real danger that Washington does not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The global economy hangs in the air just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat cannot be ignored any longer - emphasizes the Tages-Anzeiger from Geneva.
Some states can still offer a lifeline to their staggering financial institutions, and with their taxpayers&#39; money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, we need the states of the European Union to ignore their national selfishness, and to centralize control above the divided financial markets.
On Monday alone, the weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - recalled the Viennese daily, Der Standard, which adds that the fears that European taxpayers too will have to put their hands in their pockets, very deep, similarly to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really taken care of the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses the old continent from one end to the other.
The &quot;rescuers&quot; must not immediately brandish a hundred billion euros, on the other hand it would be wise if they noted in which case it would be rational to touch taxpayers&#39; money, with the objective of preventing larger damage.
The intelligent automobile imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What method would be better for developing technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, if not the imitation of an obstacle detector already existing in nature?
Like, for example, that of bees.
In the amazing project showcased at CEATEC, taking place in Japan, the buzzing bees provided the initial strategic idea for Nissan engineers to inspire them on how they should design the next generation of obstacle sensors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired self-controlling robotic system, type BR23C, which it has equipped with the qualities of bees, the final objective being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee constitutes its own space, oval in shape, which in reality looks a lot like our secure protective shell - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development and relations department technological public of the brand.
The faceted eye of the bee plays a vital role, since it is able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To mimic the functions of the faceted eye, engineers came up with the idea of the laser range finder.
This identifies obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, it evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately transforms it into an avoidance maneuver.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it by an angle sufficient to avoid the collision.
Unlike any existing system today, this avoidance maneuver takes place entirely instinctively.
&quot;If it were not so, the mini robot car could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle&quot; - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for the moment the collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process should reflect what the bee is doing to avoid other bees.
The process should happen in the blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, difference cannot go up, down, or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that the bees have to avoid other bees, in our case we could only use the rotary movement, the acceleration as well as the deceleration as maneuvers available to the mini auto robot
The BR23C uses Lithium polymer batteries which are lighter and have a larger power pack, which makes their life longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is essential, not the processing of data, and even less the capacity to store.
This mechanism must process only a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers. This way it only uses a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
You don&#39;t need memory with a capacity of gigabytes, or even megabytes.
This is the first step towards designing a technology for instantaneous avoidance. According to Nissan&#39;s estimates, this system will make its way into mass-produced cars within the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to their destination avoiding obstacles in their path.
We even gave the expensive baby a name
The written version of the economic rescue plan of 700 billion dollars, aiming to buy back the bad credits of the banks, and to use in several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this sum will be spent.
Reuters reports that in new debates lasting until after midnight Saturday local East Coast time, congressional leaders have agreed on controversies that have existed for days and days over the bailout. totaling $700 billion.
&quot;We have taken a serious step forward&quot; - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Speaker of the US House of Representatives, according to which it remains only to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, however other measures have yet to be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not a question here of rescuing Wall Street, but of turning the cogs of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets, Sunday evening at 8 p.m. local time in Washington (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., according to local Central European time). , but did not cause a spectacular rise in the stock markets.
Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill responding to the name of emergency economic stabilization law of 2008. Then, its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House also welcomed news of the deal.
&quot;We are pleased with the progress made overnight, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,&quot; said Tony Fratto, White House spokesman.
Moreover, the program diverges from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which mentioned that the 700 billion dollars should be spent in one go, for the repurchase of securities relating to doubtful credits.
From now on, a maximum of half of the sum of 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the law is passed by Congress, probably on Monday. This first sum will be used by the Secretary of the Treasury to buy bad debts from the banks, while the use of the additional 100 billion dollars will be left to the discretion of the President.
The program will be overseen by an independent body, in which the chairman of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The spending of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: it will be able, at the same time, to buy bad debts, securities relating to mortgages and bad mortgages, as well as other types of debts &quot; toxic&quot;.
Relevant ministry officials said buybacks can take place through an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the possibility to the companies concerned, to take part in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools at the origin of the concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson said the law provides the tools to devote $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it&#39;s the vast redemption of bad debts, their insurance, or the avoidance of risk. to see the system leading to the collapse of one or another important financial institution.
&quot;We will take the necessary steps to be ready for the application of the law, as soon as it is signed&quot; - he added.
On the other hand, the leaders of banks finding themselves in bad shape and waiting for state aid can expect that their severance pay, simply called the golden parachute across the Atlantic, will be capped by the government.
Salary ceilings are mentioned only in very specific cases. In addition, the limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat offers its assistance to the company.
The principle of capping means that if the Treasury Secretariat buys it back at auction, they will levy excess tax on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Directly after the buyback of bad debts, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to executives is not exaggerated.
For the image to be complete, it must still be added that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The cap only concerns new contracts, in order to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal caps will be in force on the salaries of general managers - commented the chairman of the Committee in charge of financial benefits of the House of Representatives, the Democrat Barney Frank .
In addition, the State obtains the right to acquire shares in the banks taking part in the plan. In this way, the taxpayers&#39; risk decreases, since they can even be winners in the case as soon as the economy and with it the saved banks fall back on their feet.
The bill says that within five years, the President must introduce a proposal to Congress that will rule on how losses will be returned to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
This is not what the American citizens commissioned us for, this does not protect the taxpayers&#39; dollars - said Republican congressman from California, Darrell Issa.
Fellow Ohio Democrat Mary Kaptur thinks the same people are pushing for action as those responsible for Wall Street&#39;s collapse.

Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz thinks there is a good chance that around January 12, the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will come into effect. This is what the Minister of Foreign Affairs declared in Chicago, in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, &quot;now it all depends on when the electronic entry and control systems across the Atlantic will be put into service&quot;.
However, she drew attention to the fact that under the new system there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today, in Washington.
He will meet the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will present the decoration of the Commander&#39;s Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisers of the candidates in the presidency, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support bank bailout
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, pledged their support for the government&#39;s $700 billion bailout plan. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Treasury Secretary.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, representatives in Congress and the Administration finally announced, at dawn on Sunday, that they had reached agreements in principle on the bailout plan for the banks.
This financing plan, aimed at thawing the crisis on Wall Street and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as more apt than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama has again managed to get a bit of a head start. McCain&#39;s lead, secured with the nomination of Sarah Palin as running mate just after the Republican convention, has melted away.
During a campaign rally held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion bailout bill.
He pointed out that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages that he too supports.
&quot;Now is the time to act, with responsibility (...) a danger threatens your work, your economies, entire industrial sectors and the stability of the entire economy&quot; - he declared before a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to call McCain&#39;s economic ideas outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: &quot;We&#39;ll all have a hard time swallowing it (...) but doing nothing is not an option&quot;.
The Republican senator said that the proposal mentions the creation of a Treasury control commission and the capping of severance pay for senior executives, and that he was personally very committed to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, said Sunday that there are serious hopes that the chamber will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
The press review of the German linguistic territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - this is how Der Spiegel, the CSU&#39;s low score in the Bavarian country, evokes.
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of reds and blacks.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled &quot;The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers&quot;.
According to this recognized political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
Christian Socialists transformed Bavaria for decades and now it is these same modern citizens who are turning their backs on them.
This change of era is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not entirely a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was probable just ten years ago came to an end: the indisputable hegemony of the national party is completed.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU came in with 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago during the Bundestag elections of 2005, that is to say at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization &quot;devouring its parents&quot;, implemented in the region in a consistent way by the CSU.
Sociologists have been announcing this for 40 years, but they were seriously mistaken about the rhythm. However, secularization, educational outcomes, and the settlement of North and East Germans in the growing region of Bavaria could not remain without consequences for the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right camp is intact, it is only inside the party that the voters have become more aware, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that during these last weeks, it is precisely the groups of traditional citizens who have rather moved away from the CSU, such as the self-employed, craftsmen, holders of the baccalaureate and graduates of higher studies.
In these groups, support for CSU dropped below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled &quot;Who? With whom? Party presidents are cautious about coalition questions&quot;, the conservative Austrian daily deals with the situation of the confused domestic politics that has arisen after the elections. Austrians.
The Austrian socialists of the SPÖ wish to discuss with the conservatives of the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The populist BZÖ party is open to negotiations. The Greens do not want to agree on the coalition yet.
The elections have taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; during debates organized on public television, party leaders barely let their cards be seen.
Werner Faymann, chairman of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to talk to the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that the collaboration of the two parties is indeed possible - this is what already exists in certain regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, remains open on the part of Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the reds&#39; proposals.
As he has already said, a collaboration will surely be fruitless if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
In his party, the choice of the opposition or the entry into the coalition is momentarily a completely open question. These points must absolutely be discussed within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, the president of the BZÖ, is once again open to all proposals.
&quot;To avoid the coalition of red and black, we are ready to assume government responsibilities&quot; - said Haider.
Járóka said: We must break the vicious cycle of poverty and segregation
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities began, hosted by France, as representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In her message to the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, MEP Fidesz European People&#39;s Party, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is a violation of the law that affects Roma children the most and is therefore one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened on the one hand by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labor and Social Affairs, and on the other hand by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, social affairs and equal opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most eminent representatives of European legal protection and civil organizations, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz People&#39;s Party MP&#39;s group, Járóka warned that alongside the distinctions observed during recruitment, the Roma are disappearing from the labor market, in the first place, as a result of their low qualifications.
&quot;An overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have high school diplomas, and as a result of a poor quality elementary education, only a tiny fraction have the opportunity to obtain a higher education diploma.&quot;
Furthermore, Járóka insisted on the fact that education as a basic human right plays a key role when it comes to asserting other fundamental rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of the member countries of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relationships in the widest possible circle, also between Roma and non-Roma.
Indeed, the earlier a Roma child starts school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labor market; through the taxes paid from its income and consumption, it contributes to the state budget.
&quot;By virtue of their EU nationality, Roma must be assured of their right to quality education, and be protected from low quality and sectarian education.&quot; - underlined Lívia Járóka.
According to the deputy, a collaboration of the European Union directed towards an objective and an action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of desegregation of the schools. For this, compliance with existing and draft anti-discrimination directives is of paramount importance.
&quot;The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and joblessness must be broken. Democratic opportunities must be given to Roma children, so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of the &#39;Europe&#39; - demanded Járóka.
In the name of the &quot;European Year of Equal Opportunities&quot; ensured for all, the aim of the Summit for Equal Opportunities in Europe, held every year since the summit in Berlin last year, is to ensure single platform to support the measures taken to promote equal opportunities and to combat discrimination, aimed at European level and at the level of the Member States.
A fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information concerning his drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market is spiraling out of control.
“There are data protection programs that bind the use of information regarding the prescription of drugs, in all cases, to the consent of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it&#39;s like entrusting your chicken coop to a fox&quot; - reminded Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage drug prescriptions, to the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the capital insured in the event of damage depend on the state of health of the client who presents himself, and if they consider that the risk is too great, they do not insure him. not even.
In the past, they sent candidates for a medical examination, and they only signed an insurance contract with them after seeing the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much less expensive procedure: from an identification number, he easily obtains from pharmacies the data concerning the person&#39;s drug purchases in the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines itself, what disease the person suffers from and what is his state of health.
For example, if that person regularly buys high doses of a cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts them in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some determine at the same time a risk coefficient, so there is not much left for the insurer to do apart from the paperwork. However, tiny issues can still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, certain mixtures can be used against migraine or against hot flashes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others are not.
Societies have developed in research and data analysis. They must ask the patient&#39;s permission before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been sanctioned for their failings in the past.
Recently, some companies are also processing the results of laboratory analyzes and linking them with data on drug consumption. In this way, they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of patients&#39; health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and monitoring its use is becoming more and more difficult at the same time.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope only extends to practitioners and insurers.
A bill on expanding the authorities&#39; circle of control over companies specializing in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is not enough and that is why he has developed his program even further, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question to know if the person concerned is really free to give his consent or not, since if he refuses, the insurance companies do not sign an insurance contract with him.
So and ultimately, the hens depend on the benevolence of the fox.
CSU: grace for a period of transition
It is in October that the decision on the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be taken
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal matters at the Bavarian CSU summits has been adjourned.
The party president, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still keep their place. The question is how long will grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic 17 percent loss of votes, will be on the agenda of the exceptional party congress, held the last weekend of October.
The members of this very criticized pair have, in any case, made it feel that they did not particularly care about their seat.
Thanks to this, they worked to appease the furious members of the fraction and the base, who one day after the &quot;Bavarian tsunami&quot; demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the peak of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 per cent, while today, a year after the putsch against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remained.
For 46 years the CSU was the &quot;sole ruler&quot; of Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But, the conservatives still count strongly in this region of the south, of key importance for the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the vice-president and the federal minister of agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor to Huber, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates groping discussions with the liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Free Voters, formed along right-wing values, about a possible coalition government in Munich.
A strange snub of fate was that with the help of the list of Free Voters, the Gabriele Pauli, whose taking action against Stroiber served as the possibility of a putsch perpetrated by the Huber-Beckstein duo, entered into the legislation, only to treat the very ambitious municipal politician harshly.
Now, CSU leaders are pouring all their energy into somehow stabilizing Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who until now has been pulling the strings behind the scenes, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and ex-president of the CSU, designated September 28 as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber hurled some scathing remarks at the CDU. According to him, they deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will only be able to be chancellor again if they somehow get back on their feet, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hiding her disappointment with the fiasco with difficulty, the CSU&#39;s loss of ground will not negatively influence the grand coalition in Berlin.
Which is however relative because it will not be easier to manage the wounded CSU, and the crisis of the social democrats still lasts.
Since 1946, the SPD achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals: 110 - 0
No opposition MPs made it to the Belarusian parliament after Sunday&#39;s elections.
According to Russian observers, this is due to a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is due by illegalities committed during the counting of the votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the 110-person legislature in this country of 10 million people has been doing very well without opposition for many decades, ahead of yesterday&#39;s elections, the opposition joining forces as the United Democratic Forces ( ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his mandate as president for the fourth time in dubious elections, in the footsteps of the modification of the constitution in 2006, this time would &quot;allow&quot; the presence of some opposition deputies in parliament.
In this way, the ODSZ renounced its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, economically increasingly dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order described as undemocratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive visas of entry, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus had to take a credit because of the decrease in imports of Russian natural gas, always more expensive, and thus contributed to the passage of the company Beltransgaz, owner of the gas pipelines crossing the country, passed into Russian hands.
The fact that the OSCE, when evaluating the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than shortcomings, such as the ban on running for a third of opposition candidates, referred to prior appeasement.
However, Monday&#39;s OSCE statement already challenged the campaign, during which most of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present during the vote count. votes.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: the political prisoners have regained their freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and the &#39;Abazzia separated from Georgia. However, Russia, with which Belarus forms a confederation on paper, has considered the two territories independent for a month already.
&quot;We have taken two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has been initiated between Belarus and the EU&quot; - Alexander Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that things stay that way, despite the fact that &quot;the authorities were afraid in this parliament, which has no weight, of bringing in even a single opponent&quot;.
The opposition does not plan any protest actions in view of the results. Rather, she is trying to get her message about the need for economic reform to the voters.
&quot;Of course, we have a lot of worries on that side: we have to have our opposition newspapers printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting a spoke in our wheels as far as circulation is concerned, but I can also see that they are more and more in support of the elections, even in the circle of the elderly&quot; - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that in the current Lukashenko regime, which considers social security as its main result, the layer of pensioners the most officially supported no longer really consider it appropriate.
&quot;Because of the country&#39;s indebtedness and the increase in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, &#39;evoking the silence of a cemetery&#39;, is only a matter of time&quot; - believes Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the Commonwealth of Independent States mission, told Russian news agency Ria Novosti: &quot;People don&#39;t believe in words, but in deeds.&quot; In this way, the absence of the opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other, largely global, issues.
Today, a France-India summit will also take place where it will mainly be a question of cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is an emerging democratic great power that should be given a greater say in international affairs, but member countries have yet to agree on their support to New Delhi for its candidature as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not dwell too much on this question yesterday, at this 9th summit organized in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, like the current President of the Union, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and the head of diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years, they would double trade, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be too ambitious an objective.
In this sense, they harmonized from a legal point of view the 26 bilateral agreements with India concerning civil flights. In this way, air exchanges can also take off in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009 at the latest.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the negotiations.
The objective is to balance the situation with, on the one hand, India, which is the EU&#39;s largest trading partner, and on the other, New Delhi, which is only in ninth place among the partners. of the EU.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The Afghan and Pakistani situation was strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a UN conference on this subject was mentioned.
The completion of the Doha trade round has also been sought, although both have a large part in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains committed to the energy and climate program, in particular that it would like to reduce its discharges of toxic materials by at least twenty percent until 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as with the fact that a global deal should be made at the climate conference scheduled for next year, and to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. fifty percent until 2050.
They would also like to prevent the rise in food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian head of state is going to the French capital today, where during a bilateral meeting, he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth twenty billion euros for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to information from the news agency, the agreement would cover 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair expects for this edition, more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403,000 titles on display, and Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Assets and Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Butterfly: in fact, Italy will be present in an institutional way, with a Point Italy- 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by the appointment with the press in the Room Struktur, at the butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and forecasts on the position of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors is gradually decreasing in relation to the total Italian production, and in particular, in relation to that for adults and children.
Brunetta: &quot;From today, breakfast before work&quot;.
Never, in the history of Palazzo Chigi, had there been revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from today, this new measure is in force against smart people, against who points and then goes to drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-idle novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
&quot;The revolving doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services&quot; specifies the Minister.
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
&quot;It&#39;s reformism&quot; further emphasizes Brunetta.
The installation in all the establishments of the Presidency of the Council is completed with the Palazzo Chigi.
According to Masi, &quot;the choice of revolving doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance from the employees was recorded, assures the general secretary: &quot;it is a process shared by the employees, and we had the collaboration of all&quot;.
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissant.
Promise of Brunetta, who suggests with a smile, &quot;a good cappuccino at 7 am is an excellent and healthy resolution&quot;.
During a conference at the School of Public Administration
from Rome, the Minister communicates that “in three months, the absences of sickness of public employees have been reduced by 50%, that is to say 60,000 more workers in one year”.
And he adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more efficient.
Italian, &quot;whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - over the last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and well beyond inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees united to challenge the norms of the Brunetta decree using Codacons.
&quot; &quot;While the Minister of Public Service today spreads the data concerning the drop in absenteeism in the workplace due to illness - writes the consumer association - the people of &quot;active lazy people&quot; continue to increase.
In fact, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive Public Administration employees have come together to declare war on the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in the event of infirmity due to service is contested; the extension of the working hours of the sick worker&#39;s home, during which the control visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister.
Accidents in the workplace, Napolitano: &quot;Prevention crucial&quot;
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 work accidents, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail data indeed confirms that white deaths were around 1,200.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon which remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To have the attention of institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic aspect, the Anmil celebrates today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of victims of accidents on the job, institutionalized the second Sunday in October.
&quot;The worrying data disseminated by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the subject of prevention in the workplace&quot;, said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, during a message sent to the president of Anmil, National Association of Disabled and Disabled Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his &quot;sincere appreciation for the ongoing effort of associations in favor of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of victims and the awareness of public opinion&quot;
&quot;Naturally indignant, everyone has banged their fists to put an end to such tragedies which, by their size, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if the daily reality presents us with dramatic cases , even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that &quot;there is certainly a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information&quot;
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, to maintain attention towards this phenomenon, not to underestimate the alarm on the social seriousness, to apply and improve the legislative standards.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed how &quot;this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and requires all institutions to make a concrete effort aimed at end it quickly.&quot;
The data of the injured on the job seem to signal a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from being impressive&quot; underlined later the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
&quot;We don&#39;t want this &#39;trend to discount&#39; to actually translate into minor attention, because it&#39;s precisely when attention relaxes that tragedy happens.
&quot;We believe that in general, not enough is done to contrast the accident phenomenon and the contrast can be achieved through multiple actions.&quot;
&quot;In our opinion - underlined Mercandelli - more controls and inspections are necessary, as well as a greater intervention on the training of workers, and this, starting from school.&quot;
- He added - &quot;that we still have to make an effort in terms of communication and awareness of public opinion.
&quot;But above all, we need a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.&quot;
“Mercandelli then denounced “the progressive deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for victims of work” and the “drift of assistance towards which the system has been moving in recent years”.
&quot;The objective, therefore, is to give back to the worker the guarantee of insurance - he added - so that the destiny of the one who has an accident, should not depend on spontaneity or the widening of the legislator&quot;
Mp3 player pointed out, they put hearing at risk.
Listening to music at full volume for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is announced by the European Commission, which, in a press release issued in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the unforeseen and recently identified health risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
&quot; from this scientific report - we read in the note - it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music at full volume using portable musical devices, for more than one hour per day per week, risk permanent hearing loss.”
&quot;I am concerned that such a large number of young people, who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at full volume, may unknowingly damage their hearing beyond repair,&quot; says Meglena Kuneva.
&quot;According to the scientific data - continues the EU official - this is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What matters most is to educate consumers and make this information public.
In addition, we need to re-examine the existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can keep up with new technologies&quot;
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
&quot;The scientists - concludes the EU executive - confirm that there are good reasons for concern, and that the European Commission will now examine with Member States and other interested parties, what measures could possibly be adopted to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100Db, but concern is growing about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to effectively limit these data by resorting to solutions such as reducing the levels and duration of exposure to noise.
The EU Scientific Committee points out that users of portable music devices, who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the current limits relating to the maximum noise level allowed on the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for prolonged periods of time risk permanent hearing loss after 5 years.
This concerns 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified around 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to send the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we end, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the schedule set by the Capitol for the work of the &quot;Commission for the future of Rome Capital&quot;, which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will finalize the guidelines for Rome.
In March when they have finished, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyzes and the projects, so as to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the &quot;official stamp&quot; of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
“The commission is absolutely independent; all the political, social and cultural ideas are represented there - emphasizes Alemanno - it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome which can be used by the political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Municipal Council.
No overlapping of roles, only the desire to have a corner in which to draw up a great project for Rome.
In March, she will have finished her tasks and will then disappear, because this experience must have a precise temporal duration.
In June - announces the mayor - we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale. &quot;
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: &quot;It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by the management of daily life and emergencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to see ahead, and further, towards a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wishes to emphasize that &quot;this Commission is not a useless body or a bureaucratic set: it is absolutely free, and will not cost Roman city dwellers a euro, and will serve to study and involve the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, &quot;we need a draft strategic reference, neither firm nor immobile, in order to allow our city to improve, which it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future, maintaining a unitary spirit, &quot;.
A future which, specifies the mayor of Rome, &quot;will not be limited to the usual municipal borders, but which will look beyond&quot; not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but &quot;also in relation to to the role that Rome can and must have, as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean&quot;.
Barack Obama? The first anti-American president. That&#39;s why.
A famous American politician who insists on being independent, wrote: &quot;Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions destroyed the US economy and had dealings (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.&quot;
Attacks on Obama increase as election date nears.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: &quot;this person is full of ambition&quot;.
Obama is really cheeky: he believes he will win the highest office in a nation that has altogether two governors and five black senators!
In reality, these are attacks that do not say much; these are obviously attacks of a racial nature, and do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, which all say that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks from the heart and not from the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know well to whom the American patriot will give his vote.
Here emerges an aspect of the American mentality kept secret until the end.
“Say what you want, we will see ourselves putting the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed until now, so much so that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Anyway, despite all this reasoning, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
We asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was kicked back home.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack their bags.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush&#39;s weak point.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge task to accomplish.
Usa, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it&#39;s time for deletions. And many accuse the Internet of this &quot;murderer&quot; of newsprint.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mind control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly tell the information officers, feeling less worried about credibility.
They don&#39;t feel isolated like they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
Also, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to assemble the newspapers, are a big problem.
This is a problem that must be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism, as the general public understands it, is not to be significantly reduced.
An obvious but complex pessimism pervades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and journalists at print newspapers are convinced that journalism nationally is going down the wrong path.
Locally, the executive group is at 65%.
Print publication versus broadcast.
Journalists have no trouble seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishers are making their way to the Internet, perceived by many as the &quot;assassin&quot; of newsprint.
The &quot;economic pressure&quot; felt by journalists is increased by up to 79%.
All 500 journalists interviewed admitted to embracing technology hoping it would &quot;do something good&quot; for their journalism.
Today, the biggest snag in American journalism is between who runs the newsrooms – that is, the directors – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of managers at national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at local level this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is linked to &quot;work safety&quot;.
Directors who think they will lose their job within 3 years are 47% nationally.
As far as journalists are concerned, we are going to 30%.
That of &quot;safe work&quot; at the staff level (our editors, editor&#39;s note) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the USA, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often give what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of take it or leave it.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn 10 thousand dollars a month, in addition to pension and insurance payments.
As for holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, past a certain number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often &quot;sick&quot; during the year.
It&#39;s the climate&#39;s fault.
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS IN GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a dwelling in Rome.
. Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the Unipol-Bnl escalation investigation.
During the trial against him, last week, he had obtained house release transformed into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate agent be allowed to travel from the provincial town to a dwelling in the capital.
According to the court, such trips (which the pm did not grant) would allow him to influence his company and to have access to the evidence which accuses him.
Elites in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the rescue plan of 700 billion dollars approved by the White House: a good number of Americans were, and the is still more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the US economy.
And it is indeed the New York Times of yesterday which confirms it to us communicating that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions as well as to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to &quot;those of Washington&quot; and to the world of finance, powerful especially in the States of the Center and the South.
The soul, precisely, which made itself felt in a despotic way with the vote of which I spoke to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been quoted is only one example of the changes, the great changes that the current economic earthquake heralds or is already allowing to happen: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and maybe not just here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to be accelerating the phenomena that have been brewing for some time, to such an extent that, in the new climate, they are solidifying and revealing themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the double category State-sovereign, in relation to a sort of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions which obviously have close relations with foreign countries, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of the people and families who live in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for who governs it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost only here national.
Political internationalization seems really out of the game, or else has little to say: the clear proof is given to us by the European Union which, divided as usual between the various interests and between the various national strategies, fails to decide on any common political line.
And so, it is from the government of each State that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all an allocation of credits: when you are going through a difficult period, there are only the States which possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put things back in place.
They also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of inestimable value, elements which no market or international organization will ever be able to dispose of in an analogous way.
This new emphasis on the nation-state crisis is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-greater importance that more recent economic developments tend to attribute to a factor quite closely linked to this element: territoriality.
. Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized all of a sudden, that our future will on the contrary have to settle its accounts ever more often with relatively unmaterial things like water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth, but which are absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
So whoever is sovereign certainly has more cards than whoever is not, that is, whoever is unlucky enough to live in a place with no crops, no oil and no water.
I now come to the second novelty which however provides for a break.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leaderships, economic species that have proven to be inadequate and full of gray areas.
And in addition, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even disturbing: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of estrangement which tends to involve the whole class of directors in an increasing number of Western countries.
Thus increases even more the conviction of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to to have the same time, and to be always more foreign to the opinions of the majorities.
in short, the demand for leadership feeds underground a powerful and branched movement of delegitimation of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifests itself in the improvised electoral &quot;revolts&quot; or, in the changes of collective moods of in recent very recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria, to the fall of Labor in Britain, to the rebellion of US congressmen against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right in Italy is not did not happen by chance).
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, someone would say, always have more difficulty, which is not new today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis reinforces, increases and potentially agitates in a disproportionate way.
In view of all this, to speak of a current &quot;rebellion of the masses&quot; on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
But we say well, keep your eyes wide open, this is not without reason.
The superglue for walking on walls.
Overcome the laws of gravity with super glue and, in the future, walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the objective of various American research centers, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring barely 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers succeeded in keeping a 100-kilogram body glued to a vertical wall.
THE STUDY- The American journal Science published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know that use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
&quot;The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti.&quot; Explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs which ensure the animal has a perfect grip.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it &quot;detaches easily from the wall&quot; explains Liming Dai, researcher from the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
WALK ON WALLS? –&quot;this material could be used as a temporary adhesive&quot; adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers are thinking of a much less fascinating use such as connecting electronic devices, since carbon nanotubes conduct heat and electrical current.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
So far, no superheroes.
THE OTHER RESEARCH- The University of Berkeley, in California, is also dedicated to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American journal American Chemical Society, Californian researchers presented an adhesive made up of microfibers like hair, which cleans itself of dust during movement over a surface to guarantee perfect and constant adhesion.
Medicines: never with fruit juices.
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are thirst-quenching and rich in vitamins, if associated with certain vital medicines, alter their absorption, amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness, depending on the case, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether canned or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: all it takes is a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs, nullifying their beneficial effects and putting the health of patients at risk.
Grapefruit juice has already been heavily criticized for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-staminal and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
RISK DRUGS - It was the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which gave the news in a newsletter dated two years ago, alerting doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger deriving from this mix and to be careful what you drink, if you take medication such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT JUST GRAPEFRUIT- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology of the Public University of Milan: &quot;these discoveries are in general, immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies which will have to, if necessary, change the informative notes of the medications.
It is always advisable to read the illustrative papers of the drugs that one takes, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to address clearly to the doctor or the pharmacist&quot; underlined the expert to Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize for Economics goes to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on trade patterns and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a well-known New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration&#39;s economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, during the days of Enron&#39;s bankruptcy, Krugman had written, in an article published in the New York Times, that the second event would have been more determining than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that unleashed many controversies, and which was reproached to the economist for years, but which has now proved to be correct.
&quot;I am surprised and even a little shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has faded from public attention,&quot; Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a &quot;highly valued economist&quot; but also a &quot;very aggressive&quot; whistleblower, particularly critical of the excesses of Bush administration liberalism.
Open Office, here is the third edition of the &quot;anti-Microsoft&quot; package
It&#39;s the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to reach ever and even more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following almost a year of work, carried out by volunteer developers, supervised by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is being shown to the general public with various new features: from the welcome screen, and the revised interface that has become less austere, to other more important ones, such as the compatibility born for the operating system Apple Mac OS X, and the support for the new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting are some functions specific to certain modules, such as the one that allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by e-mail, or to import PDF files into the graphic elaboration module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front, it is possible to create &quot;hybrid PDF&quot; documents that unite the typical graphic of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
The collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements inside the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on the modifications, in the elaboration of texts, because to each collaborator is assigned a comment color for better recognition during the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring certain features of OpenOffice to the web (on the cloud), and in the next few weeks they should release the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at the address http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version which was on the mirror since Friday.
Besides Windows and Mac OS, the suite is also available as usual for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be shipped to your home or workplace.
And if the theme of free can be a way to spread it in homes, it is precisely in business, that Open Office the suite tries the big challenge, being able to already count on various projects carried out in the public administration and the schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for Word&#39;s video writing equivalent; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint rival presentations; Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphics module.
Objective for 2008, to arrive at 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is probable that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian from the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the best climber&#39;s jersey.
It is the site of the daily L&#39;Equipe which reports the news.
At 26, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist at Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on the Kohl test tubes are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter analyzes confirm the positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will necessarily have to count on two years of elimination.
News of Kohl&#39;s positivity to third-generation Epo was confirmed by the head of France&#39;s anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told The Associated Press that he notified Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus winning the polka dot jersey for the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS:NEW YORK TIMES WONDERS IF ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy &quot;as a Country of emigrants has recently transformed into a privileged destination for immigrants&quot; welcomed with reluctance.
Would that turn the Beautiful Country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times is interested in, which dedicated a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy, starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for having stolen a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the &quot;paradox of the north&quot;: the northern regions are both those where there is &quot;more integration and more work&quot;, but also &quot;an anti -the strongest immigrants in the country and the most important supporter of the Lega Nord&quot;
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
not only.
Even the new legislature desired by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as proof of the changing climate in Italy.
Trend underlined by the Pope as well as by the President of the Republic: &quot;Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism.&quot;
Found the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of Steve Fosset&#39;s plane, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris was found on a plateau 3,000 meters above sea level in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson dismissed any lingering doubts: &quot;The plane was located, we dispatched a team, and now we have confirmation that it is indeed the one Steve Fosset was on. was traveling the day he disappeared,&quot; he told a news conference.
The sheriff therefore specified that no human remains were found either on the plane or in the surroundings.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered deceased.
The US Transportation Safety Board (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the wreckage was spotted, a team of investigators sent to the scene identified the aircraft: it is indeed the Bellanca 8kcab, disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset&#39;s personal effects were found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
They are two documents bearing Fosset&#39;s name, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweater.
Fossett&#39;s research was halted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, he became in 2002, the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had traveled around the world by plane and nonstop.
Among all these records, also that of having flown at a height of 15,445 meters, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertisement you don&#39;t expect.
An extraordinary 4x4 with an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, ample surfaces and clean angles.
Here, in synthesis, is Glk, the latest off-road &quot;compact&quot; from the house of the star, with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new life into this sector.
Precisely because of its non-standard, unexpected and unconventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17th.
Thus the hype that will accompany the debut of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented method of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milan&#39;s shopping, Corso Como, until November 15th.
The first phase of this new type of communication foresees the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, one will have the impression that by looking at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elimina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spotlights, in all its details, to then be recomposed into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertisement Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of motorist communication.
Will it succeed with this formula in arousing the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the &quot;Italy Ultras&quot; group which has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, had never created any major problems.
Neither had ever clashed with the opposing tifosi.
The extraction of the group is from the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, there were added small groups (few in fact) from Campania and Puglia.
They had tricolor flags on which appeared their city of origin: Saturday evening, they were all removed so as not to be identified.
They are inspired by English tifoseries.
In Bulgaria, they found a tifosery of real Nazis, that of Levski.
La Figc had made available to Italian tifosi, 144 tickets for the game: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had indeed checked them all: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been banned from attending a stadium.
Four Italian tifosi who had a history of stadium crime, were not entitled to a ticket, and could not make the trip.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts which will arrive from the Bulgarian police, and will then take measures: in this case, it could be that the tifosi arrested or identified in the disorders serve a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo which prohibits attending Italian stadiums, but also European ones.
In short, our hooligans will no longer set foot in the stadium.
Fortunately.
But now it&#39;s time for fear-emulation: that is to say that others risk being added to the first hundred and fifty.
&quot;We must put out this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves like this&quot; supports the Viminal.
So &quot;keep your eyes peeled especially in view of Wednesday&#39;s national team game in Lecce&quot;
In Puglia there is indeed a small core of Ultras Italy supporters.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms which can even count on a section of the Aise, that is to say the secret services, which deal precisely with the problems of the stadium.
&quot;The Duce-Duce choirs, and the outstretched arm during the Mameli anthem? In Bulgaria, it&#39;s not a crime&quot;
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really not pleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Observatory of the Viminal (he took the post of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect in Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria praising Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 tifosis was shameful.
&quot;I am not a sociologist - adds the number 1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group had remained in the rules, now we will see what happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let&#39;s also talk about the whistles towards the Mameli anthem: those too are not crimes, but if you allow me, they are not polite...&quot;
Students victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student rental market is not experiencing a crisis
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants&#39; union, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
&quot;The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire categories of young people from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that the families of origin have to bear - explains the head of the study office from Sunia, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the high demand from students has distorted the market so much that a process of generalized increase has begun even for residents.
In most cases, offers to rent additionally have a series of violations: contracts of free type, unregistered, without limit of rent, subleases.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of tax taxation are necessary to calm prices.
Reading the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it costs around 450 euros; for a single room, we go from 650 euros minimum (Bande Nere area), to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room around 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), they ask about 600 euros for a single, 450 for a bed in a double.
Slightly lower values (550 euro for a single) for areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can only save if you move away to peripheral areas: 300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a single in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed you need 300/400 euros, for a single you spend 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, for a bed, it takes 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the city economy.
Finally, in cities such as Perugia, where rentals are often taken by students from outside the community, there is a further anomaly: the rent charged to foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old Cinema Paradiso, the cities elect the historic halls.
Historic movie theaters are closing in favor of Multiplexes.
&quot;A city without movie theaters is a blind city, it&#39;s like a face without eyes&quot;
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the major Italian urban centers, but also in the provincial towns,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of large multi-screens, and the death of single-screen consumption in the central areas of cities, is one of the major events that seems to us to be inevitable and indisputable; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, these are often historic places loaded with memories, &quot;it&#39;s as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a bit of a journey and so many emotions&quot; observes the director of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso, a film which won Tornatore 20 years ago the first Oscar as well as the Cannes Jury Grand Prix, and which told of the poetry of a provincial theater and the nostalgia of a way of living cinema, perhaps lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main trade association, say it all: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and it is the cinemas in the main cities that have mainly paid the costs: 10 fewer than Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilia Romaine leads with 82 single-screen cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The proof that confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is indeed the three Italian regions which have registered the most new multi-screen cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy over the past five years, 81 in Tuscany as in Emilia-Romagna.
&quot;Italian exploitation has developed in an irrational way&quot;, observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, &quot;it is useful to build new structures, but it would still be necessary to guarantee the survival of those which already exist, because when a room closes in a city, these attendees are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the failed deliberation of the credit in favor of traders: the antecedent debt of the State is around 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect the existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city which, worried about these closures, decided to resolve the situation by signing a protocol between City Hall and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote cinemas mono rooms in historic centers and on the outskirts.
Among the standards planned, there are tax facilitation measures in favor of managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic zone, and will have special rates for parking and in certain parkings.
&quot;It&#39;s an initiative that I like&quot; observes Giuseppe Tornatore &quot;and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna&#39;s example by implementing other measures.
It is however obvious that, to contrast the superpower of multiplexes, traditional cinemas must also improve the quality of sound and image, because today&#39;s public is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema de Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make &quot;New Cinema Paradiso&quot; to which I already thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have experienced so many shared emotions, I turn to the other side so as not to see the panels blackened by dust.
Links between politics and &#39;ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
&quot;The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to make the choices of the Town Hall uniform with the interests of the Piromalli clan.&quot;
heavy accusations are launched by the magistrates of the Antimafia Directorate of Calabria, against the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The controllers also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his lawyer grandson, namesake of the boss, already condemned for association of mafia-type criminals, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
&quot;an affront to legal and moral norms, and above all to common sense&quot; write the prosecutors, the two local administrations had expressed the will to pay for consultations with Maître Piromalli.
&quot;Thus the clan would have been granted - write the judges - to enter officially inside the town halls facilitating the possibilities, already considerable, of control and orientation of the public administration&quot;
The president of the Calabrian regional committee Agazio Loiero, does not hide that &quot;collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one&quot; in his region: &quot;there are places where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest&quot;
This morning&#39;s arrests follow those of last July, following which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
At the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still because of presumed conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the SVP at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed leader of a centre-right coalition after the May 2006 ballot.
He cried foul when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the communal council.
He accused the deputy minister of the interior at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing him of having engineered the whole thing for a political question, but given the request for imprisonment signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even managed to request the variation of the A3 project.
Starting from the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the pm write, emerged &quot;the readiness to marry the demands of a businessman, representative of a better known group, close to the Piromalli, standardizing the choices of the public administration to the clan interests.
When the energy is born from the waves, now the big ones are launched.
Here is a disproportionate deposit which occupies more than 70% of the surface of the planet and now the large world energy companies are in the process of discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources that giants like Chevron have laid their eyes on, and are now trying to get their hands on.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years now, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil are giving a great boost to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world&#39;s electricity needs could be covered by sea swell exploitation systems.
This quantity would be double that produced by nuclear power plants.
And in addition, there would be currents and tides..
Colossi on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed like a real revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more candidates among these companies, which have always been dedicated to traditional energy, are betting on marine energy.
&quot;Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies - a spokesman for a company associated with the American oil colossus told the Wall Street Journal - and is evaluating the possibilities of cooperating with us&quot;.
The cooperation in question relates to the obtaining of a permit deliberated by the US Energy Commission, necessary to give rise to a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if we consider that precisely in Alaska, the United States continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavations
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which are running the ocean power route, and the amounts invested to date, although their details are not are known, indicate, according to observers, a growing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts speak of a technology still in its infancy, because ocean energy does not dispel fears about environmental impact.
At present, systems like those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small in size, and do not seem to create any major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a greater ecological impact.
&quot;And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys linked to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the mud up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure from the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure spins a turbine which in turn powers a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through submarine cables.
Right now we have four such systems in the planning stage, pending one federal approval, and some of the power could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, is already generating power for a shopping center and parking lot using six underwater turbines from New York&#39;s East River.
The movement of the water during the tides causes the blades of the turbines to turn, creating a rotary motion that powers a generator.
Verdant has announced that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
Of particular interest, they say at the Institute for Electric Power Research, deserves at this time, the potential of the tides.
Although an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on the energy of the tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, look towards the coasts, invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and foresees investments up to 35 million in 2009.
