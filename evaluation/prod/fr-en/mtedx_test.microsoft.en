Good evening!
Our planet is 70% ocean-covered, and yet, strangely, it has been chosen to be called "the Earth".
The poet Heathcote Williams has a much more objective and less anthropocentric view, when he says that "Seen from space, the planet is blue.
Seen from space, it is the territory, not of men, but of whales."
And yet, we all come from the ocean.
It is the cradle of life, even if it has been forgotten.
The ocean is everywhere: in glaciers, rivers, groundwater, in the cells of living things, and in our veins.
Strangely, it was John Fitzgerald Kennedy who illustrated it quite well, in this quote: "It is an interesting biological fact that everyone has in his veins an equal percentage of salt in his blood, as that which exists in the oceans.
So we all have salt in our blood, our sweat, our tears.
We are connected to the ocean, and when we return to the sea, whether to sail, or to look at it, we go back to where we came from. »
And yet, this ocean, we know it very, very little.
It's still a rather strange and foreign world, which is scary sometimes.
That said, in fact, it is far from being an inert body of water, a body of water that serves no purpose.
In fact, it is marine life that makes this ocean a main regulator of the climate, the main carbon sink, and also, the main producer of oxygen.
Between 50 and 70% of oxygen comes from the ocean.
So, in fact, more than one out of every two breaths you take, you owe it to the ocean.
Not quite at the ocean!
In fact, you owe it to marine life.
Marine life is what allows this body of water, precisely, not to be just a body of inert water, but to be this machinery that allows us to live.
And, marine life goes from phytoplankton, which provides oxygen, to large whales, large predators, tuna, dolphins ... And among these species, there are some that are ecologically more important than others, including sharks.
This is, therefore, the example I chose because it is an animal that we tend to demonize, a sea monster.
And yet, every year, 70 million sharks are slaughtered.
It is as if we were exterminating the equivalent of France.
However, sharks are evolutionary record-breakers.
They are 470 million years old.
This means that, for 470 million years, all life in the ocean has been shaped by, and according to, sharks.
And as a "top" predator, keystone species, when you remove sharks from an ecosystem, you have a collapse of marine biodiversity.
So where sharks have disappeared, we have dead water, or we have jellyfish explosions, but we no longer have life.
There you go!
That is the role of predators.
We, as humans, tend to think of ourselves as the "top" predators.
And yet, we are far from being predators, since, in Nature, predators are, on the one hand, regulated by the availability of their prey - and this is no longer the case for us since we invented agriculture and livestock - on the other hand, predators tend to reproduce less.
So cheetahs or lions are going to have far fewer cubs than mice or rabbits.
Mice and rabbits are prey, naturally, so they need to reproduce very quickly, and in very large numbers.
Sharks, whales, dolphins, are predators.
They were not designed to be prey.
We made them prey!
So they cannot, in fact, survive the predatory pressure of man.
There is also a common point between all these marine animals, whether predatory or not.
It is that they all participate in marine life, that is to say a life cycle, unlike us.
To give you an example of blue whales, a blue whale produces, every day, 3 tons of excrement - excrement that is very rich in nitrogen or nitrogen - and these are the essential nutrients for phytoplankton that provide us with the oxygen we breathe.
In fact, 40% of the phytoplankton population has been lost over the last 50 years, largely because whales were exterminated in the twentieth century and before, but even more so with the invention of the explosive harpoon.
Man goes to sea.
It is not part of that ecosystem.
We are no longer part of it since we left the ocean.
So you're an intruder.
We are an intruder with means of fishing, predation, which are, today, industrialized.
And we are a predator that no longer has the natural limits of predators.
So there are more than 7 billion of us, and today, 7 billion human beings want to eat fish.
So that's a big problem.
The other problem is this illusion that we had for a long time, and that we may still have, but less and less, that in fact, marine life is unlimited.
Jules Michelet, who wrote a fairly well-known book, which is a reference in the field, illustrates it quite well: "At certain narrow passages, you cannot row, the sea is solid.
Millions of millions, billions of billions who will dare to venture to guess the number of these legions.
It is said that once, near Le Havre, a single fisherman found 800,000 one morning.
In a Scottish port, 11,000 barrels were made in one night. »
When we read the historical testimonies, we are told that off the west Atlantic coast, French, we saw whales passing by for days, the boats had to stop.
Those near the coast, did not sleep, sometimes, so much the breath of the whales made noise.
Today, when you see a fin, you are amazed.
We lost the memory of what the sea was like before we started fishing.
Here is also a quote from Thomas Huxley that illustrates the lack of knowledge and denial in which we were: "Nothing we do can affect the number of fish."
And yet, today, 90% of the ocean's large fish have already been exterminated.
The problem is also that it is difficult to empathize with fish.
It is already difficult to save whales.
Whales are charismatic animals with a large sympathy capital.
Yet today, in 2016, they continue to die under the blows of explosive harpoons, despite moratoriums, despite sanctuaries.
This is one of Sea Shepherd's main fights because we consider that if we cannot save the whales, it will be very complicated to save anything else in the ocean, let alone sharks that we consider monsters, or tuna, that we do not interest.
Fish are so discredited that they are referred to in terms of tons.
So we are going to talk about 13,000 tonnes of quotas, 13,000 tonnes of tuna, or 15,000 tonnes of sharks.
It would shock you if I talked about tons of giraffes, or tons of dogs, or tons of... French!
Fish are not even considered individuals.
It is simply a mass that is part of a stock, which must possibly be preserved, in order to make exploitation as profitable as possible in a sustainable way.
Then!
We can wonder, say that, finally, if the fish disappear, if the ocean is bad, anyway, we are fine.
There are many of us.
We are everywhere.
Still, beware because there are misleading signs.
In reality, what precedes the extinction of a species are several factors, including these three, which are the main ones: the population explosion, the overexploitation of resources, and the occupation of all ecological niches, that is to say the fact of spreading everywhere.
Maybe it reminds you of someone...
In fact, if you're looking for an example of an endangered species, there's no point in Googling, you're looking in a mirror, or you're looking at your neighbor.
So, we're not doing that well!
Today, we are hearing about sustainable fishing.
And yet, United Nations scientists predict a collapse of fisheries by 2048.
2048 is in 32 years, so it's... tomorrow morning.
What does a collapse of fisheries mean in practice?
It means more fish.
It doesn't just mean that you won't have fish on the menu or that when you go to the fish shops they will be empty, it means the death of the ocean.
Because as I explained earlier, before being a food source for anyone, fish, like marine life, are the essential working force that allows the ocean, precisely, to be this extraordinary machinery that allows us to live.
Imagine having to do without more than one breath out of two.
Imagine that all this carbon dioxide that is captured in the ocean, which is even more important than what is captured by forests, ends up in the atmosphere.
In fact, it would be the end of human civilization.
Then...
Basically, I gave you reasons, I gave you very down-to-earth reasons, let's say, why defending the ocean.
In the end, the solution is quite simple, for us, for everyone.
If you do not depend directly on fish for a living, it is best to refrain from eating them.
Seven billion human beings will never be able to eat fish.
In fact, marine life will be exterminated.
So that's when you think in a utilitarian way, because the leitmotif is this: if the ocean dies, we will die.
So, if we want to live, and we want our children to be able to live after us, we will have to take radical measures, and we will have to change our lifestyles, we will have to "adapt".
That's the watchword of evolution and the species that want to survive.
As Darwin told us, adapt or die.
So we're going to have to adapt, and adapt quickly.
But, personally, what motivates me in all this, and what makes me here, before you, this evening, is not so much this question of survival, utilitarian, praiseworthy, but utilitarian.
In fact, it's rather... this difficulty that I have to live with this injustice that is subjected, in fact, to everything who is weaker than us, and I find that it is morally and ethically, the engine that drives me - an injustice that is very well described by Milan Kundera, in this quote from "The Unbearable Lightness of Being": "The true goodness of man cannot be manifested in all purity and freedom,  than with regard to those who do not represent any force.
The real moral test of humanity – the most radical, which lies at such a deep level that it escapes our gaze – is its relationship with those at its mercy: animals.
And it was here that the fundamental bankruptcy of man occurred, so fundamental that all others flow from it... Thanks!
(Applause)
My daily life is made up of sensations that most of you do not know.
For a long time, I was ashamed of it.
I remember very well the circumstances in which I discovered this difference.
I was 4 years old and I wanted to express to my mother the joy I felt looking at the sun through a leaf and I told her not about the leaf as such, but about the colors and sensations that were caused by what I had felt when I saw the leaf: these yellow and green lines,  This very particular taste, halfway between sugar, mint, cucumber, which came to me by following the veins and imagining a whole series of possible futures, imagination, like a golden fog, joy like shimmering water... She just thought I was crazy.
And then, so, I hid it and growing up, I was frustrated to keep these perceptions that seem very beautiful to me and I tried to represent them in this painting that you see.
Immediately, thinking of these emotions, I also found the ones I had felt while listening to this music, Verdi's Va Pensiero.
(Music) Synesthesia is not a disease, it is just a different perception of things that leads senses that are normally not connected to each other to enter into relationship.
For example, you hear the musical note E, and you see it blue or green.
You taste an apple and the taste of this apple will evoke a geometric shape.
It's innate and it's involuntary.
There are a multitude of different synaesthesia, this would concern according to discussed evaluations about one person in 2000; discussed because most synaesthetes are unaware of being synaesthetes until they discover the existence of the phenomenon.
Thanks to my synaesthesia, my emotions, my thoughts, my associations of ideas, as you have seen, my little inner voice, everything appears to me in the form of colors, shapes, tastes, movements.
It enriches the perception of the world and the paintings I try to make to represent all this are about as faithful to the original perception as a freeze frame compared to a 3-hour film or a photo of chocolate cake compared to a real chocolate cake.
But it's still much more meaningful than words.
The words say nothing of the world and that's what I tried to paint in this painting: at the bottom left, you have the real, the emotions it inspires me, the thoughts, above, the imagination; At the crossroads of the imaginary and the real, the voice.
And little by little, you have this narrowing going to the right, when you have to pass all this inner wealth in this tiny dead end, the words.
Throughout my childhood, I thought to myself why hadn't we invented specific words to express all this richness?
Why didn't we invent a specific word to talk about the joy we feel when we look at the sunlight in a leaf?
Why didn't we invent another different word to express the joy we feel when we see our child again, when we see our spouse?
But it has nothing to do with it.
Probably because it has not been considered useful and in fact, recent research on synaesthesia would tend to show that we all, as children, would have these nerve connections in addition, which explain synaesthesia.
But we are losing them little by little.
There is no fatality to that, words are a framework, it has a convention that allows us to communicate, now, nothing prevents us from preserving the richness of our perception.
Yet we do not do it, we lock ourselves into the framework of words, we narrow our perception of the world to these words when nothing obliges us to, probably because we think that is what others expect of us.
In antiquity, studies carried out on ancient languages showed that colors were perceived in a very particular order: first black, white, red, green or yellow, and finally blue.
So this sea you see blue, the Greeks in antiquity saw it purple, for example.
Conversely, where you see snow, a Scot may think of one of the 421 words used in his language to talk about snow.
Inevitably, it has an impact on the way we see the world, how we perceive it, it is probably this change of scenery that we are looking for by going to the other side of the planet to discover new landscapes, certainly, but also new ways of seeing, perceiving.
And very curiously, no one makes this journey that can be just as fascinating, which is simply to ask his neighbor: "Your perception of the world, your little inner voice, what do they tell you?"
If I make you travel in my synaesthesia, you will enter a world where using the same word remains the best guarantee not to understand each other.
When I worked in financial diplomacy about 13 to 14 years ago, there was a very buzzword, it was "sound policies" which was used to refer to the policies that a country had to put in place to receive aid or debt reduction.
In the UN's vision, "sound policies" was a global respect for human rights and not too much corruption.
For the IMF, it was a balanced budget, period.
For the World Bank, it is the vision of the UN, the vision of the IMF, and then other things, investments in economic development in the broad sense, agriculture, urbanization, transport.
Now, these three international organizations, you put them at the same table, on the same text, using the same word, visually, you see immediately that the misunderstandings will be numerous.
You may be able to grasp the beauty of diplomatic language of giving the illusion of an agreement where there is not necessarily one in order to move forward, but you will also understand why there is then a need for a whole bureaucracy to deal with what happens next.
To enter my synaesthesia is also to apprehend an environment where thoughts and emotions appear at the same time as a satellite map and at the microscope level.
I represented in this painting the vision that comes to me when I think, in a novel I am writing, of the meeting between the main character, Arthur, and his friend Berenice, at a time when Berenice has hurt herself, the way they will fall in love and then lose sight of each other.
Behind this overview, you have plenty of more microscope visions that correspond to details of the chapter, to character elements of the characters.
For example, the chart on your left points to and illustrates how Arthur sees Berenice's character.
A cheerful girl who is full of hope but who also presents incomprehensible dark ideas.
If I vary the circumstances of their meeting, if they meet at the beach, if Arthur's character is different, if Berenice loses her dark ideas, immediately, the vision I will have of the chapter will change, both at the satellite level and at the microscope level.
You're probably wondering what's the point of being a synaesthete?
This is a difficult question insofar as it is something that we do not control, we are born with it.
But we can play with it and have fun with it.
Personally, I find it a great richness to always be on the border between two frameworks: the synesthetic one in which I think and the one of words in which I try to communicate today.
Playing with frames means, for example, not brainstorming at the level of words but at the level of perceptions and sensations that precede these words.
I'm willing to bet that the creators of Cleopatra glue, which some here may remember, thought much more about the almond-like smell of this glue than its glue properties as such.
Playing with frames also means not feeling constrained by the way others will receive your message.
Thus, I wanted to write a poem and make a painting that illustrated the synesthetic vision that had given rise to this poem.
I talked to a publisher who told me that he was not interested, that the important thing was the text, the painting we couldn't care less.
I talked to a gallery owner who had the opposite reaction: painting is the most important, the text we don't care.
And then, after a first moment of discouragement, I said to myself that the most important thing was the message: what was the form, what was the mode of expression that was adequate to this message?
So, if I try to make a poem to express the emotion that my synaesthesia gives me on a daily basis, it could look like this: the fire dismasted in the fury of sounds, rearing like a sun, the almond of reality with orphan constellations dazzles the interline thought of non-existent vertigo.
This is the poem that corresponds to the painting you have in front of you.
For me, the two are linked and inseparable.
Now, poetry lovers will be more sensitive to poems or not, painting lovers will be more sensitive to painting or not, but in the end, it does not matter, because here ends the adventure of my perception and here begins yours.
(Applause)
Hello.
You know what I do every day when I walk around Paris?
I can't help it.
I open the garbage cans and look at what's inside.
At first, it was shame for my children.
Now I am very happy because they do like me.
So, from the trash, I take out bottles, flasks, cans, cans and lots of cardboard every day.
These materials are recyclable materials.
They have nothing to do in this bin.
Nothing at all.
And yet, they are there.
To sort, it takes three seconds.
One, two, three.
Three seconds.
It is not long and yet, multiplied by 65 million inhabitants every day, it is huge for the environment.
Huge.
So these three seconds, when do we need them?
You need it when you've had lunch.
We need it when we have dinner.
We need it when we get rid of it, we ask ourselves the question: do I throw away or do I sort?
Do I lose or do I win?
So what do we lose and what do we gain?
We all lose a lot when we don't sort.
Because these recyclable materials, they are wasted.
They will either be burned or buried in landfills.
And we are not going to tell ourselves a story: when they are in landfills, there are a little bit that will go into the forests, in the countryside and in the sea.
When we sort all out, we gain enormously.
Enormously.
A can that is sorted, it will first be transported, sorted, collected, transformed, pampered, and it will become again a can or a bicycle, a car, a whole series of objects.
And it's the same for glass, it's the same for plastic, bottles, cans, and it's the same for cardboard.
All these materials, if they are put in the right bin, [will] be able to be reused.
We can all sort, all sort, at the bottom of our house or next to us.
All.
And it takes 3 seconds.
This ability that we have to sort, this ability that we have not to pollute, it is simple.
And we owe it to two men.
Two men who, in the 90s, changed the game.
Remember the dumps back then.
There were everywhere, it was overflowing and we could not manage the environmental impact of consumption.
And there, these two men decided to trust each other.
Instead of having the classic reflex of saying: "Come on, let's create a tax!"
And then we will create an administration, there will be an administration that takes care of it.
And then we forget the subject.
These two men, Brice Lalonde, Minister of Ecology in 1992 and Antoine Riboud, boss of Danone, they decided to do otherwise.
While few people were talking about ecology in 1992, they say: "Well, we are going to create a private company, a non-profit company, but it will be private.
And it will be 100% of general interest.
100% private, 100% dedicated to the general interest to focus on this subject.
So she's going to recruit and she's going to make sure she attracts other companies. »
Another 50,000 FMCG companies rallied and worked with local communities.
An incredible invention, and then the public would actually do the collection, sorting and recycling.
The private company Éco-Emballages was going to be the pilot of the device and the State was going to control and give the objectives.
At that moment, it creates a dynamic.
Companies, brands, associations, local authorities, municipalities, waste operators and recyclers, while they all have a radically different culture, come together and say: "Come on, here we go."
And the yellow bin is installed everywhere, or almost everywhere, and sorting begins.
Today, we are in an extremely efficient system.
In fact, the company Éco-Emballages works in a simple way.
A company that sells a packaged product, it will pay a lot if the packaging is heavy.
If the packaging is lightweight, eco-designed, it will pay less.
Afterwards, Eco-Emballages finances the whole.
€650 million is invested each year in sorting, collection and recycling.
So today, I'm also here to tell you that we have difficulties.
In fact, in recent years, collection has not progressed.
It is stable.
And I have two pebbles in my shoe.
The first is the city.
In the city, we recycle half as much as in the countryside.
Only 30% is recycled in the city.
That means when in this room, there is only one sorter out of three.
And bad news, in a few years, in less than ten years, we will be 85% to live in the city.
The second pebble in the shoe I have is plastic.
In 1950, 1.5 million tons of plastic were produced.
Today we produce 350 million.
In a short time, 750 million tonnes of plastic will be produced.
And the problem is that plastic is only 23% recycled.
If you don't sort the plastic, it becomes that.
We have to sort the plastic because the seventh continent exists.
The seventh continent, it is in the sea, it is plastic particles that, little by little, trickle down and will create the largest landfill in the world.
There is an alternative to that.
If we ever do that, if we take that bottle and everything else and put it in that bin and use it, then what happens?
That's happening.
That's plastic that can remake a bottle.
It is plastic that is made without oil, it is plastic that remakes all the objects that can be used every day, without touching natural resources.
It is plastic that comes from the yellow bin.
It is plastic that comes from your sorting gesture.
And that's why today, I'm launching a call for ideas, a call for projects.
Between you, with your friends, your associations, in the neighborhoods, let's try to find projects, ideas that revive the collection, that allow us to produce this, that allow us to transform plastic into resources.
And a resource has value.
A family that does not sort today is like throwing 30 euros a year in the trash.
You will tell me: "It's not much, 30 euros here."
But if we take two hundred homes that do the same thing in a building, that's 6,000 euros.
A city or district of 30,000 inhabitants is 900,000 euros that leave per year.
That's why I'm launching this call for projects.
Get organized, send us your proposals.
With local authorities, we will find solutions to select and finance them.
Today I would like to tell you that our only competitor is inaction, and that three seconds, three seconds to create a barrier to pollution is simple and it is great.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Good evening everyone.
I will tell you my story.
I am 17 years old, with the baccalaureate in my pocket.
My father dreams of only one thing: that I prepare the competitions of the grandes écoles.
He is himself at ESCP, where he teaches computer science and marketing.
And he said to me: "Go ahead, son, hang on!
Go beyond your limits! »
I, in fact, think only of one thing, it is above all to go beyond the limits of my neighborhood.
I only think about one thing: to travel far, [not only] in France but elsewhere.
As a result, I modestly enrolled at the university of Nanterre University in ethnology, then in ethnomusicology.
Ah!
This is a good opportunity to travel.
I work my thesis on the music of Benin, North Benin, a population called Nyende.
Two months of travel, four months of travel...
But now, I'm struggling to finish my university course.
I only think about one thing: playing music.
I am a drummer, percussionist.
I work in different world music formations.
I love all music: biguine, jazz, African music, Balkan music, rai, and so on.
In 2004, I founded my own band called Haïdouti Orkestar.
What is the Haïdouti Orkestar?
It is the meeting of Balkan music, Eastern music and Turkish music.
Quite a program!
Sound familiar?
Sound familiar?
Not really.
So, this group is composed of musicians from very, very different origins.
As Georges Moustaki would say: a real group of "metics".
There is a Greek from the Rue de la Roquette who barely aligns three words of Greek; a pure gypsy from Serbia, a Bulgarian, French people - yes, French people like me, but scratching a little, never really French - a Spaniard but who claims to be Catalan please, from Barcelona.
Do you know this group, Haïdouti Orkestar?
No.
I hear "Yes", there is a person.
So much the better, here's an excerpt.
(Video: Haïdouti Orkestar - "Ya Ayn Moulayitain") (Sylvain on stage) It's a song in tribute to Syria, to the Arab Spring, at a time when we still have a little hope.
Normally, in concert, people get up and start dancing.
You can... It feels good too!
(Rhythmic clapping) (End of video) (Applause) Thank you!
I discovered this music at the end of the 80s, it begins to date, especially through the films of Emir Kusturica "The Time of the Gypsies", "Underground".
I think everyone knows these films.
Yes, anyway!
For me, it's love at first sight, an incredible click.
I am passionate about this music.
I literally fall in love with this music and I dig deeper.
This is the beginning of a long immersion in these cultures.
In this journey, I will meet people, musicians, because, for me, it is a question of entering this milieu of Balkan music - in the music of gypsies, I do not know anyone - meeting Turkish music, looking for all that.
That's it.
I will portray three people who have meant a lot to me.
The first is Jasko Ramic.
Behind it is a woman on the snorkel.
She's the only woman in the group please.
I think a lot about her, her name is Charlotte.
Let's go back to Mr. Jasko Ramic.
He is a gypsy from Serbia.
He is a true virtuoso of the accordion, a real "size", as we say in the jargon.
He has an empirical, theoretical knowledge of all this music.
I meet him in a cellar in Paris.
It is a Bulgarian musician friend who introduces him to me.
In addition, he is a polyglot man.
He speaks Russian.
He speaks Romani, and Serbo-Croatian.
But now, I'm coming, I speak French.
And I can't communicate with him.
Big problem, how to exceed this limit?
In the end, we don't talk, we play.
Since then, we have been working together for more than 10 years.
He makes me discover this culture, this music, his energy, his nostalgia.
And I see that what I'm learning really contrasts with what I hear in the media.
In the media, what do I hear when we talk about gypsies?
I hear things that are not very beautiful.
It's about slums, it's about kidnapping children.
And me, I really live something else.
I travel to Bulgaria, Macedonia, Greece.
I feel safe there.
I met generous people who give me their music literally.
There you go.
I advise you to go and see the work of La voix des Rroms which is an association that deals a little with all this Roma problem and gives a positive image.
A second person who meant a lot to me, he is a trumpet player.
He is Lebanese, but in fact mostly French since he grew up a few kilometers from here, in the south of the department.
This boy has incredible energy.
I meet him, he is 25 years old.
So, it's been a good ten years.
He is Lebanese and his parents fled Lebanon.
That's important.
This boy, today, he is very well known.
His name is Mr. Ibrahim Maalouf.
I think you know him.
This boy brings us to the Olympia.
Recently, we wrote the music for the film "La Vache" by Mohamed Hamidi, with Djamel Wilson... Djamel Debbouze, Lambert Wilson!
(Laughter) (Video: "The Great Journey") (Sylvain on stage) That's the meeting of cultures!
That is an excerpt.
(Video: Ibrahim Maalouf and Haïdouti Orkestar - "The Great Journey") (Sylvain on stage) That's the instrument I play, among other things.
I'm a drummer and I play the drum.
(End of video) (Applause) A third person who has counted a lot in my career, my journey, is Mr. Zéki Çölaş This man comes to us from Antioch in Turkey.
It is 80 km from Syria.
He fled Turkey at the age of 30 for political reasons, with the saz under his arm.
He passed through Syria, transited and stayed in Germany, and ended up in France, in Bobigny.
So this man, I met him in a restaurant in Paris, a good fifteen years ago I do not know if it was a Kurdish restaurant or a Turkish restaurant.
At the time, for me, it's a little bit the same.
But no, actually, it's very, very different.
With this man, we will walk.
He will show me "little Istanbul".
Do you know little Istanbul?
The district of Little Istanbul is the Turkish quarter in Paris between Château d'Eau and Strasbourg Saint-Denis.
This is where culture and this whole community meets.
So, we walk in the streets.
We will meet his friends from the Özgül bookstore.
We go to listen to the latest news from Tuana Music, the only Turkish music store in Paris.
All the novelties, the records, the musical instruments, we find everything related to Turkey.
Very quickly, we have the wish to share things, to make known this Turkish music that we do not know, which is really unknown in France.
And, we also decide to go even further and open up to other cultures.
That's it, I had another card just now.
It is not the same thing.
In any case, we are also interested in Armenia and Azerbaijan.
We try to cross our limits, to cross borders.
You will notice a little bit this whole region, today, it is a real powder keg, between the problem of migrants the Kurdish problem, Erdogan today who is becoming a real dictator - we can say it clearly.
At that time, associations contact us, associations that have values somewhat similar to ours, which are for sharing.
I am thinking of the Cimade, Valeur Added.
La Cimade, I meet them in Massy, not far from here.
Every year, they have a party where we eat a lot of things, different dishes from all countries.
That was another moment of sharing.
I am also thinking of the BAAM, the Bureau d'Accueil et d'Accompagnement des Migrants.
Last September, we did a concert.
Same, it was a great moment of emotion and sharing.
Somalis, Eritreans, Turks, French, everyone found themselves together to commune around our music.
It was a great moment.
So, more recently, I also wanted to go beyond genres so I went to meet jazz.
(Video: Haïdouti Orkestar and Bojan Z-Tchagri) (Sylvain on stage) He is a Bosnian pianist.
With this presentation, I wanted to show you how much music and my encounters had opened me to the world, and that miscegenation is a way of opening up to the world.
There you go.
Thank you.
(Applause)
It's early in the morning.
You look in the mirror.
What are you saying?
Not long ago, I used to say, "Hey!
Hi handsome kid. »
(Laughter) Unfortunately, I found myself thinking "Ouch ouch ouch..." "It looks like my grandfather! »
Maybe you like what you see in the mirror.
Or maybe not...
In any case, you recognize this image as your own.
How do you recognize yourself?
What is your identity?
This topic is crucial, because the way we define ourselves affects the way we relate to others.
Before, I thought I had a very solid identity!
I was a Mexican ready to conquer the rest of the world.
So I started by moving to Paris.
Eleven years ago.
And everything was according to my plans, until last year.
Indeed, 3 events led me to ask myself: "Who is this person I call me?"
"Hello!
Do we know each other? »
The first event, I call it: "Meeting with the ancestors".
One day, when I was surfing the Internet, I read an article that said, "If your surname is among the names on this list, then you may be a descendant of one of the Sephardic Jewish families who were expelled from Spain in the fifteenth century."
And maybe soon you will be able to apply for Spanish nationality.
I checked the list!
To my surprise, my father's last name, Meza, was there.
As a Mexican, I expected to have some Spanish blood in my veins.
But I never imagined that... Does that mean there's some Jewish blood flowing through my Mexican veins?
Is that why I liked the movie "Fiddler on the Roof" so much?
Or even more importantly: am I now allowed to put guacamole in my falafel?
(Laughter) It may be crazy, but since I read this article, I feel closer to my Jewish side.
The second event: "Elementary course of cellular identity" Here I am in conversation with my friend, Julien, a French biologist by trade.
He explains: "Antonio, from the point of view of biology, I can tell you that this question about your identity makes no sense.
Let me explain: your cells reproduce and die, okay?
And your body needs seven years for complete regeneration.
So you can say that, after seven years, you're an entirely different person than you were before. »
"Wait!" I said.
You know I've lived in France for eleven years.
And you're telling me that all this time, the cells of my body have been regenerating with proteins coming directly from Camembert!
Cassoulet!
And duck confit?
(Laughter) Does this mean that, from a biological point of view, I am already French? »
(Laughter) It may be crazy, but since this conversation with Julien, I feel closer to my French side.
And finally!
The third event: "The passage of the ring to the finger" And yes, last year I got married.
Thank you, thank you.
(Applause) And my lovely wife is German!
(Laughter) Finally, his mother is German and his father is Hungarian.
So she is half German and half Hungarian.
It may be crazy, but since I got married, I feel much closer to my new German and Hungarian sides!
It's like a whole new family!
But, can you imagine the day we have a child?
How to explain to him?
"My son, my daughter, your Mexican origins mean that you have Spanish and Aztec strains.
But also Jewish roots!
Besides, you have a German trunk and Hungarian branches!
And you grew on French soil.
This makes you a very exotic plant! »
(Laughter) I think my kids will need at least four passports!
And good therapy.
As a result of all these events, I was completely lost.
Who are my people?
Do I have to renounce the one I am, before embracing the one I become?
Who is this person I call "me"?
In the end it was me who needed good therapy!
But a few weeks later, I was taking a personal development course offered by my friend Robert from California.
At one point during seminar, Robert offered us this exercise: You are face to face with another person, and looking at that person, you say, "I see you.
And I can see your strength.
And I can see your fragility.
And I know you're so much more than that! »
When Robert explained this exercise, I really thought it was California hippie madness!
(Laughter) But, when my partner in the exercise said those words to me... (Long inhale) It may be crazy, but I felt much closer to myself.
Finally, I didn't need to know in my head who I was, I could simply recognize myself in the eyes of the other.
And his eyes became the mirror where I could recognize myself, I saw my origins, and my potential.
I could kiss the whole.
I could be much more than I imagined... And that's good!
It's early in the morning, you look in the mirror.
What are you saying?
You are much more than the color of your skin, much more than the borders of your countries and much more than your genetic heritage.
So tomorrow morning, when you go to see yourself in the mirror, try to say this: "Hello!
I see you.
And I can see your strength.
And I can see your fragility.
And I know you're much more, much more than all that. »
Thank you.
(Applause)
Can you imagine patients having to wait weeks before they can be treated?
Last year, a hospital called me to coach a department that was about to close.
It was going to jeopardize part of the hospital's organization.
Doctors resigned one after the other, administrative and nursing staff were completely demotivated.
And after analysis, it turned out that all this was related to the leadership style of the head of department, whom we will call Dr. X.
This doctor X is someone very authoritarian, very controlling and very uncommunicative.
And yet, he is a world leader in his field of expertise.
Both you and me, as patients, want to be cared for by these demigods on Earth, but if he is not able to keep his team, there is a good chance that his expertise will disappear with him, and that he will not be able to treat as many patients as he does today.
Being an excellent doctor does not make him a great manager.
And that, the headhunters have understood well.
My name is Marie-Bernard Guillaume, and I will explain to you tonight why, from a headhunter, I became a hearthunter.
Most of the business leaders I meet share the same concern: how to motivate your staff?
According to Gallup studies, only one in ten employees is really happy at work, passionate.
Seven out of ten come to do their job but do not ask them more.
Two out of ten are even active saboteurs: they come with their discomfort and they prevent others from functioning properly.
Imagine the disaster it would be if we applied this ratio to our national football team, to our Red Devils.
There, you start to hurt, you understand the problem of managers.
What makes an employee motivated?
Do you all know Maslow's pyramid?
Forget it.
(Laughter) Other studies have shown that we all share three needs, three motivating factors, which are universal, whether we are male or female, young or old.
Regardless of philosophical or religious beliefs, we share these factors and needs.
The first need is the need for personal development.
It's being able to use my abilities to achieve my dreams, to achieve goals: "Wow, what good am I!
I did it!
I'm proud of myself. »
The second need is the need for autonomy.
It's being able to do what I want, when I want, and how I want.
The third need is the need for connectivity.
It is to be able to feel belonging and connected to a community, to a team, to a family.
It's being supported, being liked on Facebook.
And so, as you will have understood, the company that is able to respond to these three factors is likely to see the engagement rate of its employees much higher than elsewhere.
But most managers today still function, like our doctor X, with a hierarchical pyramid that is well defined, with roles and functions that frame everyone's roles, which has the effect of disrupting, killing any need for autonomy and any initiative.
Fortunately, fortunately, more and more companies have understood this problem and are implementing cultures of participatory, collaborative leadership.
In these companies, the well-being of the employee is paramount, results, success and financial results are the consequences.
Not the other way around.
The hierarchical pyramid is also reversed to replace managers with teams that make decisions together, collectively.
We are not among the Bisounours, there are results to achieve, there are objectives, but above all there is a vision and values that are shared by all.
You're behind the wheel of your work.
I could cite several examples of success.
I'm going to talk about a company that I am sure you're familiar with, given the average age here: it's Netflix, a Silicon Valley company.
They decided to set up an HR culture in which we will advocate responsibility and freedom.
Imagine: you are free to organize your work as you see fit, and wherever you want; we do not check your expense reports; we are not going to control the number of days off you take; You are simply being asked to do your best for the good of the company.
Isn't this a nice answer to the need for autonomy?
You are asked to take initiatives and we accept that you are wrong, because one does not go without the other.
This has the effect of creating a movement of innovation and [intrapreneurship] within the company.
I could cite other examples of success, but let's focus on the actors of these changes: who are they?
It is obviously the business leaders and managers, but it is also each of you, each of the collaborators, each of the employees.
And to plagiarize Gandhi, I would say, "Be the change you want to see in your business."
And to do this, it requires beautiful human qualities, it requires developed emotional intelligence.
And by that I mean qualities like empathy, kindness, listening, tolerance.
How to develop this emotional intelligence?
You will say, "Some are more gifted than others."
And the good news tonight is that you are all endowed with these qualities.
They are part of your human nature.
They are parasitized on a daily basis by the various stresses that surround us.
It can be physical stress - I challenge you to be kind to a dentist pulling out a tooth - emotional or mental.
And so you just have to let go of this stress to rediscover all these qualities and be able to deploy them around you.
Easy to say, but how?
And this is where I would draw a parallel with the emergence in our society of mindfulness and meditation.
It is no coincidence that we see these tools emerging in hospitals, schools, companies, and even at the last World Economic Summit in Davos where each participant was offered a meditation session before starting the day.
I could flaunt all the studies that demonstrate the correlation and positive impact of mindfulness on creativity and emotional intelligence.
I will propose tonight to experiment with a break of mindfulness instead, together.
I ask you to accept this exercise with that open mind that has brought you here today, without prejudice.
It's a tool you can use at any time of the day, on the train, in a queue, in business before a meeting, and even during a TED talk.
Are you ready?
So, let's get to it.
I suggest you close your eyes, sit comfortably in your seat, feel the weight of your body on the seat, feet on the floor, the weight of clothes on the skin.
You feel the breath of air on your face and hands.
Just observe your breathing.
Let go of all tensions, all ideas, all judgments.
Breathe.
Now turn your attention to the closest sounds.
Expand your listening to the most distant sounds.
Just rest, for a few moments, here and now.
Take a deep breath, open your eyes, reconnect with the outside world, in this room, with your neighbors.
The world is changing.
Yesterday, in an industrial economy, headhunters were asked to recruit labour.
Today, in a knowledge-based economy, it is asked to recruit brains and diplomas.
I am convinced that artificial intelligence will give us access tomorrow to levels of knowledge like we have never had before.
I am convinced that artificial intelligence will make a diagnosis on the patient that will be more relevant than that of our doctor X.
And what we will expect from our doctor X are his human qualities.
Because it is the human who will inspire others, it is the human who will bring new ideas, it is the human who will make the organizations and companies of tomorrow successful.
And so we arrive in a humanistic economy where the relational qualities of creativity and heart will be the criteria for selecting headhunters.
I can therefore only encourage you all to cultivate and deploy these beautiful qualities that you possess to practice without moderation mindfulness or any other tool that will allow you to reconnect with your own humanity, your own infinitude.
Thank you and good work.
(Applause)
Beyond our solar system, there are planets that orbit other stars.
They are called exoplanets.
Exoplanets, because they are outside the solar system.
As you can imagine, it is really difficult to detect them because they are very far from us.
And yet, astronomers regularly announce that they have discovered new exoplanets.
There is even a recent study, which suggests that among all the exoplanets that must exist in our galaxy, there could be 20 billion, likely to have liquid water on their surface, and therefore offer a potentially interesting environment for life.
Do you realize?
20 billion!
Well, if we want to study the criteria of the habitability of a planet, we will be interested in four criteria that must be met for this study to be a success.
The first criterion is that the planet is at the right distance from the star.
In reality, the image you have on the screen is a drawing of an exoplanet.
Because they are far too far away, you can't see that level of detail.
But what the artist wanted to represent is a planet in the zone of habitability of the star.
That is, on the surface of which the temperature would be the right one so that the water can remain in the liquid state for a long enough time.
Closer to us, in the solar system, there are also planets that can tell us about habitability.
So of course, today, to our knowledge, there is only one that is habitable and inhabited, and that is Earth, since we are there, and the other candidates are rare.
Mars, which according to the models are or are not in the habitability zone, and then satellites, giant planets, such as Europa around Jupiter, and Enceladus, around Saturn.
There, it is the tidal forces that compensate for the lack of solar energy.
I'm going to talk about Mars, and the Curiosity mission, which recently established that one day this planet met the criteria of habitability.
Curiosity landed on Mars in August 2012.
The animation you see, shows you the entry into the atmosphere, the descent and landing, which actually last seven minutes.
Seven minutes of terror, where the choreography must execute perfectly, with very little margin of error.
Everything is pre-programmed.
First a heat shield is used, then a parachute to brake, then retrorockets, then a crane system, to land this 900 kg craft, accurately and gently on the surface of Mars.
The accuracy of the landing is a few kilometers, while we have just traveled hundreds of millions of kilometers between Earth and Mars, for nine months.
Unbelievable, right?
Curiosity is a NASA mission, piloted by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech University in California, with several international collaborations.
It took five years to build.
And Curiosity sends us new images of Mars every day.
From now on, I will show you real photos.
Like this one.
So of course, to the eye of the neophyte, all the images of Mars look the same.
Now, what do we see, what do you see?
We see pebbles, we see sand.
In short, Mars is a desert.
A very dry desert, even, if we compare it to terrestrial deserts.
But then, is there not a contradiction with what I have just told you?
That Mars was an interesting planet for studying habitability.
That the planet is at the right distance from the sun to have liquid water.
Do you see liquid water?
It is a question of atmosphere.
Today the atmosphere of Mars is so thin, that you cannot have liquid water on its surface.
There is ice in the subsoil, near the poles, we might find liquid water at great depth, but on the surface, today we have a desert.
At the same time, I'm sure you've already heard in the news from researchers that evidence has been found that there was liquid water on the surface of Mars.
And indeed, in the past, there have been.
So, my second criterion of habitability, after distance, will be time, geological epoch.
You have to be at the right time, to have the right atmosphere, which allows you to have liquid water on the surface of the planet.
Let me explain.
When planets form, initially, they are extremely hot.
As the drawing on your left suggests.
In the case of the solar system, it was 4.6 billion years ago.
Then you can imagine the planets, as thermal machines that cool down over the course of their history.
So that at some point, for some of them, the temperature may be adequate, and the atmosphere may be adequate, to have liquid water on its surface.
This was the case, for Earth and for Mars, a little more than 4 billion years ago.
This is what we see on the drawing in the middle.
And we have accumulated, with space exploration, a lot of evidence, that indeed, there was water on Mars.
So of course, at the beginning of space exploration in the 60s, we killed the myth of the Martian, revealing a desert planet.
But very soon after, in the 70s, the images that came back to us from Mars showed canyons that looked like dry riverbeds.
And even more recently, the various missions have shown us that the minerals that form rocks, some of these minerals, are formed in the presence of water.
We are therefore convinced that indeed, in the distant past, Mars had liquid water on its surface.
And then the planet continued to evolve, with a lot of volcanism, its history diverged from that of the Earth, because it is smaller, to finally end up with this photo that you have on your right, which shows a planet with giant extinct volcanoes, huge canyons, and large desert expanses.
So why are we interested in this planet?
Well, precisely because, at one point in its history, there was water on the surface of Mars at the same time as there was water on the surface of the Earth.
And at that time, 3 or 4 billion years ago, life appeared on Earth.
We know very little about this part of our history, but inevitably we ask ourselves questions.
Is this a phenomenon unique to Earth?
What should be the conditions for this to happen elsewhere?
And that's why when we study habitability on another planet, we have to study the right time, the time when there was liquid water in its evolution, in its history.
Curiosity, like the other missions, has given us its share of evidence that there was liquid water at its landing site.
And I must admit, that the first time I saw this picture, I was working in California, we were on Martian schedule.
It's a bit of a weird experience.
The first time I saw this picture, I thought it was a gag.
It could very well have been a sidewalk after an earthquake, something like that.
But in reality, the whole team was amazed, by this image that came from Mars, and that showed us a conglomerate.
That is, a rock that is formed from fragments of rock that have been transported there, and cemented together.
And what is remarkable to the eye of the geologist is that these rock fragments are rounded.
A little bit like pebbles if you will, small pebbles that would be found at the bottom of a river.
And geologists are even able, with the shape of these rocks, to calculate the amount of water that passed through there, and tell you that there was a river with a depth of a little less than one meter.
So obviously, we did not choose the landing site by chance.
But, this image vividly revealed, that we had landed in what is once the delta of a river, which flowed there, several billion years ago.
Look, I'm showing you this other image, another rock photographed by Curiosity a little further.
This flat rock was also formed in the presence of water.
In reality, there were already some on the 1st photo I showed you, the one where we talked about desert.
It is a sedimentary rock, that is to say, it is formed of very small fragments that have been transported by the wind or by rivers, and which in this case have been deposited at the bottom of a lake to form this rock.
And then the water continued to flow through the fractures of the rock, as evidenced by the small clear vein that lies in the middle of the pebble.
And Curiosity is able to measure the composition of these rocks, with several instruments.
For example, ChemCam, the instrument I work with, uses a laser that will shoot at the rock, it will make a small spark, and to put it simply, the color of the spark tells us the chemical elements that are in the rock.
And so, I can tell you that the composition of the vein is different from the composition of the rock, and that vein is rich in sulfur.
It's an interesting element if I'm interested in life.
There are others, such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus.
In reality, the composition of the rocks will allow us to know under what conditions it was formed.
And beyond that, what was the environment of this region on Mars, when this rock was formed.
What was the temperature?
Was the water acidic?
Was the atmosphere oxidizing?
What chemical elements were present?
Were there those who are useful to life?
To answer all these questions, I will have to use all the instruments of Curiosity, because it forms my 3rd criterion of habitability.
It is not enough to be at the right distance from the star and to be at the right time to have liquid water, I also need to have the chemical environment that is welcoming, let's say, for life.
And if possible, let it last long enough, because it will take time for life to evolve.
So, here is Curiosity in its lake, dried up for some time.
This area was called the Bay of Yellowknife.
It's a real photo, a selfie, one more.
Curiosity is a little more than two meters wide, it is a little bigger than me, it is equipped with a dozen instruments, including two Franco-American instruments, ChemCam and Sam, both of which measure the composition of rocks.
ChemCam is this laser I told you about, we see its telescope at the top of the mast.
It will draw up a kind of chemical panorama around the robot.
And Sam will be able to make a very fine measurement of the composition, when we take a rock sample.
Well, since the landing, hundreds of researchers and engineers have been taking turns daily to operate, to operate Curiosity on the surface of Mars.
At the end of its day, the robot sends all these observations back to Earth via a relay satellite.
The international team takes it, discusses it, and decides what to do the next day, the business plan.
Are we going to make a new measure?
Are we going to move the robot?
We then program the on-board computer, which will run this program automatically the next day.
And so on.
It's a pretty great and successful example of collaborative work, and I'm fortunate with a few colleagues, and with the help of CNES, to participate in it from here in Toulouse.
Curiosity is also equipped with a small drill, a small drill, I will zoom in on this photo, we can see the hole that was dug in the rock, which turns out to be a clay, so a rock that was formed in the presence of water too, and we notice that the powder of this rock has a different color,  It is grayish, it is different from the color of the Martian surface which is red.
We can also see the marks that the laser left when sampling this rock powder.
Well, by bringing together all the results, from all these instruments, and the knowledge of all these researchers involved in this project, we came to the conclusion that this region of Mars, when these rocks were formed, several billion years ago, met the conditions for habitability.
Namely, that we had one or more episodes with water, perhaps for a few tens of thousands of years, that this water was soft, neutral pH, low salinity, and that we had the chemical elements, which could have been useful for microscopic life if it had been there.
This last question is not answered.
Habitability does not mean inhabited.
So we do not know, we do not have the elements to say if there was life or not.
But we have the elements to say that the environment was favorable, was compatible.
So admit all the same that Mars appears a little less desert.
That's great, isn't it?
Let's take a little height with this photo.
It is a picture that is taken by a satellite orbiting Mars, of a region that is a little further south than the one I just showed you, which is called "the Kimberley".
And Curiosity stopped, there too, we can see it on the photo, it is there.
And maybe you also see the traces that his wheels left in the sand to arrive in this corner.
And so we continue our mission as geologists, to try to understand how the planet Mars works.
And also we continue to question habitability.
Moreover, I announced a 4th criterion, which is useful, interesting, when you want to study habitability.
And also, we could wonder, why we stopped at this place to do a new drilling, and why not elsewhere?
Well, as you can see, the information we are looking for is recorded in the rock.
So it's a solid record, but on the time scales we consider, this information may very well disappear.
And that's what's happening on Earth, which is a geologically very dynamic planet.
So I have this information in my rock, and I have to protect it.
And usually, it happens by covering this layer of interesting rock with another layer of rock or sand.
But then I have to rediscover that information, when I do my exploration.
And so, either you're able to dig deep enough, you're doing archaeology in a way.
Or, you let the erosion happen.
And that's what's happening here.
The wind has been blowing for millions of years, and has uncovered mounds of rock from the subsoil that are five meters high, the three mounds that you can see, which are rocks that formed billions of years ago, and therefore inform us about how Mars was at that time.
So here, to conclude, while you contemplate this panorama that shows us the richness of the site explored by Curiosity, I just wanted to make you touch the quest for habitability.
Being at the right distance from the star, being at the right time, having the right environment, and having preserved the information.
If you wanted to be interested in life, you will also have to give time, when you have the right conditions, for this life to evolve.
We are not there yet, but a whole area of research continues to develop, to ask these questions, it is exobiology.
I would like you to realize, on the one hand, the multitude of options offered to us by all these planets.
And on the other hand, the beauty of the Earth which is habitable.
All that is accessible to us by the mind, and the finitude of the cosmos accessible to Humanity.
So you'll say, "What's the point?"
Well, yes, I am often asked this question, what's the point?
And I say, "Nothing."
Yes, because if the question is whether it will bring in money, and change my daily life, in the immediate future, no.
However, remember the lesson that Raymond Devos bequeathed to us.
"Nothing is nothing."
He had demonstrated that you could get something out of nothing by multiplying it.
He said, "Once nothing is nothing.
Twice nothing is not much.
But three times nothing...
You can already get something with three times nothing.
Isn't it? »
Well, research is exactly that.
Fundamental research is about accumulating those little things that make our acquaintance, a shared knowledge.
So of course, in a project like this, we also improve our technology, but above all, we exercise our ability to think, which is our asset.
We mobilize our knowledge to understand complex phenomena.
So, ladies and gentlemen, please continue to get drunk with curiosity.
(Applause)
Good evening.
I'm going to do my entrance again, actually.
(Laughter) Good evening to you!
(Applause) Good evening, so my topic is: Taking advantage of vice.
The subject looks a bit pompous, so I'll start with a very down-to-earth thing: a photo of my grandmother, Monique aka Mamou, actually.
My story begins two years ago, when Monique gave me a book on social entrepreneurship, a book by Muhammad Yunus.
Like many, I loved this book for two things: one, social entrepreneurship, it's great to undertake not to maximize profits, but to solve social problems, and second, I liked my race, the fact that, precisely, you can see the positive in everything he did.
That's what he does, Muhammad, he sees the positive in all the stuff he describes, even capitalism.
So, it pushed me to try to think of ideas to respond to problems caused by capitalism.
Today the economic system in which we are, it works, it is perfect like Jessica Alba, no it's a joke.
Try to laugh for the jokes.
There are some flaws, some problems, people left behind in the system.
Growing inequalities, environmental problems, pollution, mass unemployment, etc.
Besides that, there are also excessive things.
For example, there are budgets that are excessive.
One of them, which for me was really in excess, was advertising.
I will give you two seconds to read this sentence.
One, two.
What's great about this sentence is that it's in the movie 99 Francs and it really pits two parts of capitalism against each other.
On the one hand, what is in excess, that is to say advertising budgets, budgets that are colossal.
Advertising itself is not negative.
It creates desire, promotes a product.
This is not unhealthy in itself.
It is still an excessive budget.
The other part of the sentence really shows the flaws of capitalism, which it fails to fill.
North-South inequalities, for example.
We finally realize that with this phenomenal budget, less than half would eliminate hunger in the world.
This shows a real gap between the two.
I said to myself: why no longer see them in opposition but try to connect them?
Create a tool that allows, a bit like Robin Hood, to create a link that diverts part of the advertising budget, excessive, to fill one of these loopholes.
I started thinking, etc.
I finally had an idea.
She arrived at a somewhat unexpected moment, in the shower in fact.
There are two places to think, in the shower and in the toilet.
Me it was more in the shower.
I found this idea, I was really happy.
Today this idea has turned into a start-up called Goodeed.
We are raising funds today, we are 4 people.
Thank you.
(Applause) Tristan and Thomas are in the room.
Thomas couldn't come because of car problems.
Tristan is Goodeed's web designer, he's in the room.
What is this really cool idea?
It is a website where you can make donations for free.
You go to this site, you choose a donation, a vaccine, a tree or a meal.
Then you watch an ad spot.
The money generated by the ad finances his donation.
It is a free donation for the user.
That is the first side.
The 2nd, not for the user, but for the advertiser, the one I want to deepen tonight, is to show that what is in excess in capitalism, a budget seen as excessive, as something negative finally, is now re-humanized.
We have given a new meaning to advertising.
Advertising budgets have been allowed to regain meaning, usefulness.
Today, Goodeed has helped finance with WFP in Kenya the meals of 18,000 children for a month.
And that, just thanks to your donations, there have been more than 500,000, and thanks to advertising.
Finally, what can be seen as negative, can also be positive.
You just have to create a tool, try to innovate to turn it into something positive.
And the Chinese have been doing it for millennia.
It's in their vocabulary.
Crisis in Chinese is called "Weiji".
"Wei", which is the danger.
The first symbol is a man who threatens someone else with a knife.
It doesn't show that way but that's it.
The second symbol is opportunity, opportunity.
It's "Ji".
It shows that in the most critical situations, you can bounce back.
We see the positive in the negative.
Thanks to a situation that destabilizes us, we will be stimulated, see other things, differently, in a young way.
I came to tell you this tonight: try to see things frozen, like advertising, it is necessarily an excessive, negative budget, there are flaws in capitalism.
We can see them differently and try to create links by innovating.
So that's it, create companies that have this social aspect in their DNA.
Good evening, thank you very much.
(Applause)
According to the World Health Organization, there is a shortage of 100 million liters of blood in the world to meet the needs of the world's population.
In addition, the French Blood Establishment informs us that 90% of French people know that blood donation saves lives.
And despite this figure, only 4% make this gesture every year.
And this scenario is repeated in most industrialized countries.
Faced with this gap between human blood donations and the needs of the world's population, we must find an alternative to this practice, in order to respond to this real public health problem.
And, as surprising as it may seem, I may have found one of the solutions.
And the solution, I found it on a beach in Brittany.
Even as a child, I was fascinated by the oceans, and I think that Commander Cousteau's emissions were no stranger to them.
So I naturally decided to make it my job, and I became a doctor in marine biology.
An environment caught my attention very early on, because this environment was colonized by very ancient organisms.
This environment is the foreshore, or a scientific name for an environment that you must appreciate since in fact, it is the beach.
And the beach in Brittany is covered twice a day by the tide.
And the sand of this beach is home to very old organisms that you have certainly seen, by the traces that these organisms leave on the sand, by depositing your towel.
In fact, these traces testify to the presence of a marine organism called the arenicole.
So the arenicole is the name of a marine worm well known on the beaches in Brittany whose name in Breton is the Buzuc.
So I became interested in this marine worm to answer questions of respiratory ecophysiology.
So what does that mean?
Oh, it's simple, I was interested in the breathing of this marine worm.
I was actually trying to figure out how this worm breathed between high tide and low tide.
And in order to answer this fundamental research question, (Laughter) I became interested in the blood of this animal.
Indeed, blood is an extremely interesting biological fluid.
It is the interface between the physiology of an organism and its environment.
In fact, blood is made up of different cells, but the molecule that carries oxygen, the oxygen essential to all living organisms, which is a bit - if I were to take an example related to mechanics - oxygen, is a bit like the fuel that you are going to put in your vehicle.
Without fuel, it's running out of fuel.
And without oxygen, death is assured.
In fact, blood contains a type of cell called red blood cells.
Red blood cells are a small vehicle that will carry gas to the cells of your body.
And to be more precise, this molecule contains a protein called hemoglobin.
Hemoglobin is a molecule that is able to reversibly bind oxygen.
And what was my surprise, to discover that the blood of this marine worm here did not have red blood cells.
Oh, I have to be honest, when I started my discovery, I didn't know the extent of this work.
But [my discovery] went back to the ears of a learned club, called the Red Blood Cell Club.
(Laughter) I was therefore invited to Paris, to a Parisian hospital to present my research work to an audience of doctors, hematologists.
And at the end of my scientific conference, several of them came down from the amphitheater and asked me the following questions: "But sir, you have not found this molecule that has this structure, that has this function?"
"Well, yes!"
"But we have been looking for this molecule for more than 40 years to make it a universal blood substitute!"
You and I have an ABO blood type, Rhesus positive or Rhesus negative.
Only the negative O is of the universal donor type.
The absence of red blood cells in this animal gave this molecule a universal character.
And back in the laboratory, in order to test this hypothesis, I hurried to the beach to collect a few hundred arenicoles, simply to try to collect the hemoglobin contained in their circulatory system, and after purification of this molecule by conventional laboratory techniques, I hurried to transfuse rodents.
And what was my surprise, after exsanguination of these laboratory animals to more than 80%, I transfused this molecule to these animals, and nothing happened.
(Laughter) The organisms, these rodents, lived with seaworm hemoglobin.
An astonishing discovery, and today a huge hope for medicine.
A thumb of the nose to all those skeptics who asked me the question: "But what's the point of studying the breathing of a marine worm?
(Laughter) You really don't have other things to do in a CNRS laboratory? »
(Laughter) In order to support this research work, I am forced to leave the CNRS to create a biotechnology company that will be responsible for developing these molecules for medical applications.
And it only takes a few hundred grams of arenicola to make a globular pouch.
The applications of this molecule are numerous.
What for?
Well, simply because oxygen is at the center of all biological and physiological processes, therefore, ultimately, of life.
The first years of the creation of this company, I spent them developing an industrial process of production of my marine worms.
Indeed, being a biologist, it was out of the question for me to go and defaunal all the beaches in Brittany.
And today, these worms are produced in aquaculture, in a totally controlled and traced environment.
Several hundred tons of this animal are produced in aquaculture.
Apart from the worm, the raw material, the biomass, it was also necessary to find an industrial production system for extracting these molecules under pharmaceutical conditions.
And today, we actually have a whole process that extracts molecules from biomass.
From this industrial process and production of marine worms, the applications are extremely numerous.
And I'm going to give you three, but there are many.
First, it is blood transfusion.
You know, when you donate blood, a blood bag can be kept for 42 days, because red blood cells are perishable.
In addition, the cold chain must be maintained at 4°C.
I remind you that this molecule is not contained in a red blood cell.
And it is thus possible to obtain freeze-dried blood, i.e. powdered blood, which can be dissolved with pharmaceutical water.
So no more storage problem.
No more storage problems at 4°C.
This product could be quickly available in emergency areas, in cataclysm areas, where we really need to transfuse patients.
This product is now in development thanks to a partnership we have with the US army.
The second application is wound healing.
So not just any type of wound.
Wounds that will be found in people who suffer from diabetes, called diabetic foot syndrome, people who suffer from bedsores, severe burns, all these wounds have the characteristic of poorly healing.
What for?
Well, simply because blood circulation hurts.
And unfortunately, the wounds that will be found in people with diabetes usually end badly since most of these people are amputated.
And this affects 20 million people around the world.
We were able to show that dressings impregnated with this molecule were able to deliver oxygen to the feet, therefore to these wounds, and therefore, ultimately, to avoid amputation.
The third of these applications, which is now the most successful since a human trial will take place at the end of the year, is organ transplantation.
In France, 500 people die per year due to lack of grafts on a waiting list of 19,000 patients.
What for?
Because in fact, the solutions we use today in the clinic are composed only of water and salt but no oxygen carrier.
When an organ is removed from a donor, it is immediately disconnected from the bloodstream.
And we were able to show that by using this molecule, it was possible to significantly increase the shelf life of a graft.
A heart today is four hours, between the collection at the donor and the time when it is transplanted to the recipient.
One kidney is 12 hours.
With this molecule, today, we have been able to double the storage time of these organs and multiply by four the storage time of a kidney.
So, today, we are able to increase the pool of grafts available for transplantation.
Research is advancing, but it is not moving as fast as we would like.
What for?
Because the drug cycle is long, very long, very, very long, and while waiting for the market launch of our product, which could save millions of lives around the world, I can only encourage you to go and donate blood.
Be generous to save lives.
And a little advice between friends, go quickly, because tomorrow, it could be a gesture of another time.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm just coming back from Agadez, Niger.
Agadez, perhaps some know, it was the pearl of the Sahara, the gateway to the desert, the blessed stage of the Paris-Dakar.
Today there is not one tourist since the kidnappings of 2010.
On the other hand, there are migrants, hundreds and hundreds of migrants from West Africa.
The mayor told me: during the migration season, the city's population triples.
In 2 weeks when it will be less hot.
(39) instead of 45.
For those crossing the Sahara in the back of pick-up trucks to Libya, it counts.
So you're going to tell me: not yet stories of migrants, we only hear that.
What if I told you that, in fact, we don't talk about it at all.
We are only talking about refugees.
The ones you are shown on TV are Syrians, Iraqis.
They are fleeing a war.
It was explained to us that they are doctors, lawyers, that at home, they have a big house, a housekeeper.
They're kind of like us, they're white.
I cover Africa for Le Point magazine.
And the ones I've started following since June are the ones we don't want at home.
They are poor, not very educated, they are black.
They will never have refugee status.
They will always be confined to that of migrants on the move.
When Syrians take a few weeks to reach Europe, they take several years.
Many remain stuck in Libya.
Some are murdered there for no reason.
Many die on the way to the Sahara.
The desert is littered with corpses.
The idea came to me in April: I was queuing in a service for my computer.
A nice retiree came to sit next to me, looking for company.
She asked me what my job was.
So I told him: reporter in Africa.
She said, "Poor man, it must not be funny."
I said, "No, I like it."
"I don't understand why these people come to us.
There is no job for them.
They come for the allocs?
Then they sleep on my landing and they smell strong. »
So I said, "Madam, I know where they come from and you would do the same."
My ticket number was finally out, I got up, draped in my dignity, and then I asked myself: do we really know why they are leaving, these people?
Those who are not fleeing a war.
Are they really better off with us?
So I looked for a country whose inhabitants would flee en masse and which would not be at war.
It was not very difficult, the International Organization for Migration had just released a report, and the country with the highest number of nationals in absolute terms had attempted to cross the Mediterranean between January and March 2015 was The Gambia.
More than Syria, more than Nigeria.
Nigeria has a population of 175 million.
The Gambia: 1.9.
Very small country.
It was a general save-who-can.
I wanted to understand.
Of course, there were clues: a dictator who arrived in a coup in '94, Yaya Jammeh -- claims that he can cure AIDS with a drink made from plants and verses from the Koran, which makes his opponents disappear, when they are not shot in public.
There were the economic indicators: 1700 dollars of GDP per capita, which places the country 210th out of 230.
Human development.
They are 172nd out of 187.
In short, misery.
Once there, I realized that it was even more complicated.
It's always like that.
We always discover on the spot.
It was a mixture of poverty, ignorance, hope, social pressure that drove young people to leave.
And there was absolutely nothing that could deter them.
That's why I followed the path, I went to Agadez, the migration hub.
And that's why I want to talk to you tonight about everything we think we know about migrants that is absolutely false.
First misconception: it's super expensive to cross; With all this money, they couldn't have done anything else?
Assemble a box?
Well, no.
Because they don't leave with all the money they need for their trip, they don't have it.
They work along the way.
Take the example of Jamal Barry, 25, met in Gambia, near Serekunda.
Djamal manufactures furniture.
When I met him, his last order was a month ago: two armchairs, a 2-seater sofa, a 3-seater sofa.
Paid 450 dalasis by his boss.
9 euros for 12 days of work.
Djamal's parents died, he has 4 brothers and sisters, he wanted to send money from Europe, and then like many, he had to stop in Libya.
He had no money at all.
He had been racketeed at the checkpoint of all the countries crossed.
So, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Libya.
And then he was kidnapped.
And then he got sick.
So he came back after 8 months.
He still drew me the truck on which the Tuaregs transport migrants in the Sahara.
You can see, these are cages arranged to store as much as possible.
He was sitting at the end of a beam.
He had to hang on so as not to fall because the truck does not stop.
At the beginning of the journey, they were tight.
And less and less, because they were throwing the bodies of those who were dying of dehydration into the desert.
He told me, "Every day I'm going to go back because I'm already dead here."
Second misconception.
They are disloyal.
They are abandoning their countries that need these vital forces.
It's exactly the opposite: they leave to help the family.
In Africa, there is no pension insurance.
Children ensure their parents' old age.
Take the case of this gentleman, Balamin Jaiteh.
The photo he holds in his hands is that of his son, Yankuba.
Yankuba was 23 years old when he attempted the journey, he too thought he would reach Europe, he too had to stop in Sebha, Libya.
And he was unlucky.
Libyans were looking for an African from his ghetto.
These are the houses where migrants pile up before they can continue.
He told them he didn't know where he was.
He was told, "You black people all know each other."
They doused him with gasoline.
They scratched a match.
Yankuba burned to death.
His father took days to talk to me, he felt guilty.
He said, "I did that too, as early as 1975.
I have worked in Mali, Burkina Faso, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Niger and Libya.
It's normal to help his old parents, besides all the time he could work, he sent us money; You see, we were able to redo the house. »
His wife was staring at the ground.
One of his daughters had gone into hiding to cry.
When I asked Balamin, "You forbade your sons to leave?
You told them it was dangerous?
He said, "No, not clearly. »
For the moment, it is not a source of money that he can deprive himself of.
Third misconception.
They are not so poor, they have cell phones.
So, yes, they have cell phones, sometimes they even have just that.
No electricity, no running water but smartphones.
Not state-of-the-art, old imitations that take hours to reload, hours to display a web page.
Because the most fearsome, the most lying smuggler is not the little hunger pan of Agadez who crams migrants in the back of his pick-up.
No, it's the internet.
It's social networks.
They spend hours dreaming in front of the photos of those who have already passed through Europe, and dreaming that one day too, they will manage to cross.
Fourth misconception.
They will all sweep the France to pick up family allowances.
No, it's borderline offensive, I know, but not one talked about France.
At the bus station in Niamey, the capital of Niger, I spoke with a Malian who insisted on speaking to me in English, because his boss was from Nigeria, so English-speaking, he wanted to practice his English.
It was aimed at Europe, but not at all at France.
England or especially Germany.
Even the Senegalese in the ghettos of Agadez, they dream of Germany, they do not even know that French is not spoken there.
As for allowances, no one knows that it exists.
Let's make a small detour to Kenya.
Meet Farhiyo Salah, 22 years old.
Farhiyo grew up in the world's largest refugee camp on the border with Somalia, it's called Dadaab.
Today, there are 350,000 people.
When I met her in July, she had just won a scholarship to study in Canada.
She told me: "All my life I have been assisted by NGOs, now I want to have my job, earn my own money, become independent.
That way, I will come back, and I will change the status of women in Africa. »
Farhiyo wants to become a diplomat or gynecologist, not have 8 children at Canada's expense.
Finally, 5th misconception: there are too many problems at home, they will always dream of Europe.
There is nothing to do.
Yes and no.
Europe is the place from which the brothers write: "Just come, there is work here." but for most of those I spoke to, if they had had the choice, they would have done as previous generations did: they would have migrated within Africa, and especially to Libya.
The first time Ousmane Sawo, 38, went to Libya was in 2008.
He stayed for 2 and a half years.
He was a mason.
He earned about 200 euros a month.
He was able to build his house in Gambia.
It became too dangerous, one of his friends died in front of his eyes.
He came back.
In 2013, there was no money at all.
He told himself that he would do like everyone else and try to go to Italy.
As a boat, he ended up in prison for 6 months in Tripoli, because of a scam by his smuggler.
Ousmane, today, earns in Gambia, the days when he has work, 4 euros.
Just for the children's schooling and food, he spends 3.
He said, "I just need to make tea at home to go over budget.
Every day that God makes, I pray that none of my children get sick, because I could not get them treated. »
As the Senegalese of Agadez told me: "Madam, we are forced to cross, because it does not go in Libya."
They said to me: "Madam, the worst thing is to die poor.
So we have no choice. »
Even if they are afraid, even if they have seen the images of shipwrecks on France 24.
They told me: "Madam, death is nothing, we try luck."
That's why it's never good to close the borders.
Because as long as these young Africans do not have the hope of a better life, a life at all, at home, they will continue to come.
And you see, we would do the same thing too.
Thank you.
(Applause)
